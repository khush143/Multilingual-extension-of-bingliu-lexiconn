              "'Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .\\nWe , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .\\nThey never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .\\nThe food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .\\nAfter all that , they complained to me about the small tip .\\nAvoid this place !\\nI have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .\\nSaul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .\\nThe duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .\\nThe wine list is interesting and has many good values .\\nFor the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .\\nI was very disappointed with this restaurant .\\nIve asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .\\nI had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested .\\nFood was okay , nothing great .\\nChow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family .\\nI/we will never go back to this place again .\\nWent on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !\\nService was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n\\'t be beat !!!\\nYou ca n\\'t go wrong here .\\nEvery time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street .\\nEverything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .\\nI had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible .\\nCa n\\'t wait wait for my next visit .\\nI had my eyes on this place , promising myself I will one day ` give it a try . \\'\\nAnd I hate to say this but I doubt I \\'ll ever go back .\\nThe food is very average ... the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here .\\nThe only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree .\\nI had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty -LRB- could \\'ve used a bit more salt -RRB- .\\nAnyways , if you \\'re in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n\\'t waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .\\nThe decor is night tho ... but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .\\nWe ate outside at Haru \\'s Sake bar because Haru \\'s restaurant next door was overflowing .\\nWhat \\'s the difference between the two ?\\nTheir sake list was extensive , but we were looking for Purple Haze , which was n\\'t listed but made for us upon request !\\nThe spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !\\nWe went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !\\nwe love th pink pony .\\nTHe perfect spot .\\nFood-awesome .\\nService - friendly and attentive .\\nAmbiance - relaxed and stylish .\\nDo n\\'t judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .\\ni have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience .\\n-LRB- i hang out , and live , in the neighborhood . -RRB-\\nthe food is decent .\\nhowever , it \\'s the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .\\ni happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .\\ni know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i \\'m here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .\\nwell , i did n\\'t find it there , and trust , i have told everyone i can think of about my experience .\\nthe last time i walked by it looked pretty empty , hmmm .\\nThis place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .\\nI had a great experience .\\nFood is great .\\nService is top notch .\\nI have been going back again and again .\\nI tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .\\nIt melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .\\nThe sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .\\nThe rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n\\'t try to overpack the rice .\\nWe took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .\\nI went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently .\\nShe lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy .\\nSurprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .\\nIn the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , NY crowd .\\nThe food was well prepared and the service impecable .\\nI \\'m going back .\\nHaving hunted around for a quiet , romantic , yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot .\\nQuite simply it \\'s like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility .\\nThe service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .\\nThe Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough -LRB- both in quantity AND quality -RRB- .\\nI will be going back and heartily recommend it !\\nI \\'ve had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times , when I have been in the neighborhood .\\nIt is terrific , as is the value .\\n$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .\\nI am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .\\nFrankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .\\nGo hungry and enjoy .\\nThe food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .\\nI like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .\\nThe service varys from day to day - sometimes they \\'re very nice , and sometimes not .\\nThe kitchen however , is almost always slow .\\nAlso , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n\\'t .\\nThe ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .\\nJust went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday .\\nIf you \\'ve ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .\\nAdd to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .\\nThe lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it .\\nOnce you step into Cosette , you \\'re miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro .\\nThis tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain Parisian flair .\\nThe food was average to above-average ; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way .\\nHowever , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !\\nI have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews I got take out last week .\\nIT WAS HORRIBLE .\\nThe pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n\\'t even fully melted !\\nIt looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .\\nI have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst .\\nThis has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn .\\nThe pizza is overpriced and soggy .\\nYes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n\\'t make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .\\nA big disappointment , all around .\\nI think I \\'ve had some the best meals of my life at minnow .\\nThe seafood is amazing , there \\'s a good wine list , and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises .\\nThe combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious .\\nWorth the trip from Manhattan .\\nWas there Friday night .\\nBest Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .\\nAnd I \\'ve been to many NYC delis .\\nMy wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .\\nPrice no more than a Jersey deli but way better .\\nAs a Japanese native , I \\'ve lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years , but I was just so amazed at this place .\\nThis place is the most Japanese it can ever get .\\nThe signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese .\\nThis place is worth an one-hour drive .\\nI am so coming back here again , as much as I can .\\nLeon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .\\nMy wife and I always enjoy the young , not always well trained but nevertheless friendly , staff , all of whom have a story .\\nSit outside in the warm weather ; inside for cozy winter .\\nDecent wine at reasonable prices .\\nHave been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience .\\nOur teenage kids love it , too .\\nEverytime I decide to try another place on the UES , I get angry that I did n\\'t just go to Zucchero Pomodori .\\nThis is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood .\\nThe service is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions .\\nYou \\'ll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city , and most still do n\\'t compare .\\nI \\'m partial to the Gnocchi .\\nThis place is incredibly tiny .\\nThey refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .\\nThe hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .\\nThe food was bland oily .\\nI just do n\\'t understand all the hype ... .\\nWe went to Ino for Valentines .\\nWe have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .\\nWe were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .\\nAs always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .\\nWhen we sat , we got great and fast service .\\nThe people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .\\nMake sure you try this place as often as you can .\\nThis is a fun restaurant to go to .\\nThe pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere .\\nBut the pizza is way to expensive .\\nA large is $ 20 , and toppings are about $ 3 each .\\nI went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read .\\nSauce was watery and the food did n\\'t have much flavor .\\nIf you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .\\nI do n\\'t think I would go again .\\nThis place is great .\\nI had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of .\\nThe waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal !\\nService was prompt , friendly and great .\\nSlightly on the pricey side but worth it !\\nGreat pizza and fantastic service .\\nThere was a small wait , but shorter than I expected .\\nLocated at the end of a magnificent block .\\nVery cozy and warm inside ... .\\nI will be back !\\nThis is the best sushi in new york city - hands down .\\nThe place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .\\nGet the tuna of gari .\\nThe one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .\\nPlanet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .\\nWith the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .\\nThe atmosphere is n\\'t the greatest , but I suppose that \\'s how they keep the prices down .\\nIt \\'s all about the food !!\\nI went there with my friend last saturday .\\nfirst it took us a long time to find the place .\\nwe were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers .\\nbut when we looked at the menu , there were n\\'t a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .\\nthen we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi .\\nthose rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n\\'t fresh .\\nthey were dry and disgusting , i did n\\'t even finish my first piece .\\nHurley \\'s is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came .\\nTry the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .\\nTry everything for that matter , it is all good .\\nI have been going there since it opened and I ca n\\'t get enough .\\nFirst went here to enjoy their garden terrace .\\nThe food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .\\nThe Steak Tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .\\nAdmittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .\\nGreat wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .\\nIt may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .\\nHave recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .\\nPizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !\\nVeal Parmigana - Better than Patsy \\'s !\\nMuch more reasonably priced too !\\nI take all my NYC guests to VT \\'s .\\nNot sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !\\nI \\'ve been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .\\nI \\'d highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .\\nI \\'m not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much ... and we \\'re repeat customers .\\nEven after they overcharged me the last time I was there .\\nMake sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll ... .\\nit \\'s delicious !\\nMoules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !\\nTook my mom for Mother \\'s Day , and the maitre d\\' was pretty rude .\\nTold us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved .\\nStepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting .\\nTiny dessert was $ 8.00 ... just plain overpriced for what it is .\\nThe drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced .\\nTry their chef \\'s specials -- they are to die for .\\nService is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .\\nDownstairs lounge is always a good attraction .\\nRaga \\'s is a romantic , cozy restaurant .\\nThe exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .\\nIt is also extremely well priced .\\nThe staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .\\nThe bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .\\nThis is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed .\\nYour friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !\\nWhen we stumbled on Leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT , we were certainly wrong .\\nThe waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet , we were told no ... .\\nThen , to top things off , she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend \\'s jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes .\\nSuch a disappointment ... .\\nRude service , medicore food ... there are tons of restaurants in NY ... stay away from this one .\\nI had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde !\\nI loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .\\nOur server was very helpful and friendly .\\nI am bringing my whole family back next time .\\nThe food was good too .\\nThe tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .\\nThe outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .\\nInside is a little cramped , but to be expected .\\nService was prompt and courteous .\\nThis was a repeat visit and we \\'ll definitely be back again .\\nGreat service , great food .\\nPrices are in line .\\nCompared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down .\\nBut too far east !\\nI live a block away and go to Patsy \\'s frequently .\\nThe pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria \\'s .\\nTwo complaints - their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .\\nAlso , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .\\nSo eat fast and order a lot .\\nWait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !\\nBy far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant .\\nfine dining restaurant quality .\\nOver 100 different choices to create your own .\\nA must try !\\nOn a recent Sunday afternoon , a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT .\\nThis was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .\\nThe chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .\\nWith so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find !\\nWe will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .\\nI grew up on these bagels .\\nThe staff is no nonsense .\\nThe food options rule .\\nWhen I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .\\nWorth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store .\\nI stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. .\\nBeing serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .\\nI asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni .\\n-LRB- For those of you who do n\\'t know , Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese , which happens to be my favorite . -RRB-\\nHe served me an Uni Hand roll , which I never had before , and let me tell you ... IT WAS HEAVEN !\\nAside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro -LRB- Fatty Tuna -RRB- , Sea Eel , etc. .\\nThe sake menu should not be overlooked !\\nAll in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .\\nTry the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .\\nWe visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $ 35 menu .\\nService was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .\\nFood was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection -LRB- though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience -RRB- .\\nWine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .\\nTraditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .\\nI \\'ve been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square .\\nTo sum it up : Service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average Ok .\\nSeating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .\\nFood is usually very good , though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .\\nAs many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .\\nThe decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .\\nI have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye .\\nThe first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .\\nI \\'ve never ordered anything else from their menu ... there \\'s no need to .\\nIt \\'s simply the best meal in NYC .\\nYou can not go wrong at the Red Eye Grill .\\nIf we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .\\nWe \\'ve lived in the area for more than 8 years .\\nThe restaurant is cute but not upscale .\\nThe food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .\\nI would highly recommend it .\\nIt \\'s one of our favorite places to eat in NY .\\nWe had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .\\nWe were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .\\nAfter really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .\\nThe server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .\\nThe place \\'s decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .\\nI highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !\\nIf you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat .\\nMy husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .\\nThe have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .\\nThe entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .\\nPlease take my advice , go and try this place .\\nIts located in greenewich village .\\nYou will not be disapointed at all .\\nOur first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel .\\nWe were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem .\\nThe bagel was huge .\\nThey were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .\\nThe workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese -LRB- gets a little messy -RRB- .\\nI loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND .\\nThis was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart \\'s and I must say how delicous the food and the service was .\\nWhen I called this morning , I did n\\'t think I would be able to get in at 12 , but I was able to get in , along with four other guests .\\nI have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster .\\nOther guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .\\nI highly recommend Cafe St. Bart \\'s for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .\\nAll the staff is absolutely professional !!\\nI sometimes see the waiters do n\\'t have enough knowledge of their dishes .\\nBut they do .\\n-LRB- that is A MUST , but not every restaurant can do ... -RRB- .\\nIf you want to dine with large party , I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT .\\nThere \\'s nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 -LRB- or more -RRB- .\\nThis restaurant was way overhyped .\\nMy chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .\\nOkay-i do n\\'t mind the oily part -LRB- cause most are cooked that way -RRB- but it was way too bland .\\nThe scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .\\nThe service was the only thing good about this restaurant .\\nIt \\'s boring on the inside , and our sushi was pretty below average ... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor .\\nI definitely would n\\'t go back .\\nThere are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # 1 .\\nTheir pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .\\nThe price is reasonable although the service is poor .\\nfresh restaurant was amazing ... ... food was delicious and of course fresh .\\ngreat for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends ... .\\nI will be going back very soon .\\nkeep up the good work .\\nHats off to the chef .\\nI am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food , but my friend who took me there is .\\nHe has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine .\\nIt was wonderful .\\nthe salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy .\\nWe had Pam \\'s special fried fish and it was amazing .\\ntoo large for just two people but nothing was left .\\nUnbelievable .\\nHad a late night dinner on a Saturday night .\\nGreat vibe , lots of people .\\nMy husband and I both ordered the Steak , medium .\\nMy husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .\\nI did n\\'t complain , I liked the atmosphere so much .\\nWill give it another chance before I write it off .\\nVisited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .\\nOn a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .\\nAmbience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .\\nSalads were fantastic .\\nAlthough we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .\\nIngredients are organic which is a real plus for me .\\nWe will be back .\\nThis is some really good , inexpensive sushi .\\nIt costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that \\'s not just from the rice .\\nThe spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I \\'ve had at this price range .\\nThe Yellowtail was particularly good as well .\\nI have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .\\nIn any event , this is a place I \\'ll be sure to stop by again when I \\'m in this part of town .\\nBig Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment .\\nThey have it all -- great price , food , and service .\\nThe atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .\\nThe food is prepared quickly and efficiently .\\nAnd it all comes at a very reasonable price -LRB- congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each -RRB- .\\nThe takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .\\nThis place is always very crowded and popular .\\nWent here on a friend \\'s reccomendation .\\nEnjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese ... both very tasty .\\nWe both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .\\nWe concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .\\nWe \\'d go back again .\\nI recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time .\\nThe staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .\\nWe even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .\\nYes , the prices are high , but I felt it was worth it .\\nWe all felt it was worth it .\\nsometimes i get good food and ok service .\\nsometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service .\\nit is not consistent .\\nreally depends on your luck !\\nThe place is a BISTRO which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .\\nAnd where does Patis go wrong ; no where .\\nYou are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but : Cassuolet , Steake Fritte , Tripe Stew , etc ; simple stuff .\\nAnd evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful .\\nRight off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .\\nMine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta -LRB- raddichio was kind of bitter though -RRB- .\\nMy friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .\\nThe sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .\\nKind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .\\nOverall I would recommend it and go back again .\\nComing from Boston this place is like Emma \\'s Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge -LRB- although they have more funky toppings ! -RRB-\\nI started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two .\\nFor dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .\\nMMmmm ... it was delicious .\\nService was slow , but the people were friendly .\\nIt \\'s a nice place to relax and have conversation .\\nI ca n\\'t wait to go back .\\nWe have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant .\\nThe food is authentic Italian - delicious !\\nPizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta .\\nAmbience is delightful , service impeccable .\\nI \\'m still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .\\nThe hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .\\nService was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .\\nDO not try unless you \\'re just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .\\nI go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .\\nThis is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .\\nThe filet mignon dish was superb !\\nI would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .\\nIt \\'s a small cute restaurant .\\nI absolutely love this place !!!\\nFrom the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse .\\nI like the ambience , it \\'s very dark and original .\\nI came here for my friend \\'s birthday and keep coming back ever since .\\nThe sushi is amazing !!!\\nAnd amazingly cheap .\\nBig thumbs up !\\nVery affordable and excellent ambient !\\nWe ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai .\\nWe were very disappointed .\\nWe wo n\\'t go to this place again for a good meal .\\nHowever , I think this place is a good hang out spot .\\nNext time , we would n\\'t dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks .\\nMy Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !\\nTHe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too -- but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area .\\nIt is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY -- I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .\\nThey tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter , so i \\'m looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it .\\nCheck this place out !\\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!\\nFirst of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by Citysearch \\'s editorial review .\\nEither that , or the editor \\'s idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .\\nThe tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .\\nSlightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .\\nService is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .\\nFor instance , plates were just dumped on the table , I was handed the wine list upside down , etc ... .\\nSomehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .\\nTo be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n\\'t make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .\\nTo celebrate a birthday , three of us went to Mare anticipating great food .\\nNot one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .\\nFish was overdone .\\nCute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .\\nSomeone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .\\nOne of us actually liked the expresso - that \\'s it .\\nSkip this restaurant , it \\'s a big disappointment .\\nMyagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City ; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else .\\nI \\'ve never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .\\nTheir tuna tartar appetizer is to die for .\\nI come from a family of pizzeria owners , and I \\'m almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino \\'s blows my families receipies away .\\nIt is simply amazing .\\nThe place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious .\\nI highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try .\\nYou will find yourself returning quite often .\\nP.S. Please do n\\'t tell anyone in my family i eat there .\\nLOL .\\nA restaurant that does n\\'t try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .\\nNo gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation .\\nThe dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !\\nThe service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .\\nLooking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .\\nBeautiful experience .\\nThe view is breathtaking the service is top notch ... the ambiance is wonderfull .\\nThe staff offers impeccable service .\\nI had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz of Maine Lobster in it .\\nMy boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque .\\nI had Filet Mignon with garlic mash .\\nIt was divine melts in your mouth .\\nMy boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good .\\nWe did n\\'t want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough .\\nWe had Lava Cake ... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1/2 to make it .\\nIt \\'s cuz it \\'s so good you need to taste it !!!\\nAll in all we \\'re already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks !!!!\\nMy wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .\\nIf you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .\\nIt \\'s very spicy but not offensive .\\nWe will definitely go back .\\nGo to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food .\\nThe portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter .\\nThe wine list is excellent .\\nThe food is amazing ... especially if you get the Chef \\'s tasting menu and your favourite bottle -LRB- or two -RRB- of wine from an extensive selection of wines .\\nThe place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it \\'s great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .\\nPeople dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans .\\nThe food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n\\'t like .\\nRecommendations , of course , are required !\\nPlease be aware that it \\'s CASH or AMEX only !\\nWith the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .\\nThe menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .\\nWe ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .\\nThe decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .\\nProblem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .\\nNo plans to return anytime soon .\\nThis place is so much fun .\\nOur family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .\\nThis place must have cost the owners afortune to build .\\nI think the stuff was better than Disney .\\nOur food was great too !\\nAnd really large portions .\\nThe staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York .\\nWe will go back every time we are in the City .\\nIf you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde .\\nIt is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects .\\nThe food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .\\nI highly recommend it .\\nI am going to the mid town location next .\\nThe place is a lot of fun .\\nMy six year old loved it .\\nThe characters really make for an enjoyable experience .\\nThe food however , is what one might expect .\\nIt is very overpriced and not very tasty .\\nHowever , I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .\\nWe had a good time .\\nWent there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them .\\nService was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .\\nDrinks way over priced .\\nFood was good not great not worth the wait or another visit .\\nGreat pizza for lunch place .\\nService was quick .\\nThe pizza was great .\\nAnd it was quick which is very important .\\nHave the iced tea .\\nIt was wonderful .\\nWhenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .\\nDelivery is fast too .\\nGreat friendly service , Fast seating , Fast Delivery , Excellent sushi .\\nA little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite .\\nGrowing up in NY , I have eaten my share of bagels .\\nEss-A-Bagel -LRB- either by Sty-town or midtown -RRB- is by far the best bagel in NY .\\nThe bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .\\nThey have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .\\nThe lox is always fresh too .\\nHighly recommended to all !\\nI have to agree with the previous reviewer .\\nI do n\\'t get it either .\\nNot impressed with the food .\\nPrices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .\\nZero ambiance to boot .\\nI thought this place was totally overrated .\\nEverything we had was good or ok ... but definitely nothing great .\\nThe ambience was nice , but service was n\\'t so great .\\nWhen you add it all together , it just does n\\'t seem worth it to me ... especially considering the prices .\\nThis is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area .\\nI have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .\\nThius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu .\\nThe atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo .\\nThe owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .\\nDespite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .\\nI must give it Yon out of Yon stars !\\nTaxan delicious !\\nArigato Gozimas Yuka !\\nThis restaurant was recommended by a local ... as a matter of fact , he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed !\\nWe were n\\'t !\\nThe prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food .\\nWe liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York .\\nWent there for an office lunch .\\nThe location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it .\\nThere is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me .\\nTry green curry with vegetables .\\nThe quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .\\nThe service is ok , some of the people did n\\'t get what they asked for .\\nI was there on sat , for my birthday and we had an excellent time .\\nI had the best ravioli ever .\\nThe wine the service was very good too .\\nModerate prices .\\nA little noise but I think that was because of our party !\\nMolto bene !\\nThis quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list .\\nThe food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .\\nWhether it \\'s the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .\\nAlthough the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and service overcompensate .\\nA guaranteeed delight !\\nI have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio -LRB- the Godfather -RRB- has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .\\nIf you go , try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce , the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm ... everything is just delicious .\\nCheck out the secret back room .\\nOld school meets New world .\\nI pray it stays open forever .\\nThank You Emilio .\\nCiao Bella .\\nI found the food , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .\\nThe food was authentic .\\nI felt as though I were eating in Paris .\\nThe service was excellent - friendly and attentive .\\nThe prices are wonderfully low .\\nVery good wine choices .\\nI ca n\\'t believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?\\nWho has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC !\\nGet the pepperoni - YUM - and a family style salad .\\nGreat staff .\\nAlways great service !\\nI go twice a month !\\nFantastic !\\nThe food is good , I ca n\\'t lie .\\nBut the staff was so horrible to us .\\nThe hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .\\nWe were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .\\nThis place is pricey , and yes , the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price .\\nSave yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !\\nI \\'ll keep this short .\\nAmma is nothing special .\\nThe two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place .\\nI ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .\\nWill not be back .\\nDo n\\'t dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections .\\nDecor is nice though service can be spotty .\\nThis place is always packed .\\nI know because I live nearby .\\nMost importantly , food is excellent .\\nTry the sea bass .\\nHighly recommended .\\nFirst of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .\\nAs a student in NYU i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by .\\nbut ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here .\\nI am happy i did the food was awsome .\\nJUST AWSOME .\\nand yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .\\nThey are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .\\nbut overall i give it a 10 .\\n10 .\\nI have n\\'t been to the other locations .\\nHaru on Park S is simply disgusting .\\nThe fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .\\nQuite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried .\\nWill never be back .\\nhonestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .\\nbelieve us , we \\'ve been eating sushi for over 15 yrs .\\nnot sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly .\\nthe all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .\\nlimited menu , no-so-fresh ingredients , thinly-sliced fish , fall-apart rice .\\nthe only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce -LRB- even its low sodium -RRB- , the vinegar-soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish .\\nthe waitstaffs are nice though .\\nwont come back again for sure !\\nI have been to Roth \\'s twice and both times were very disappointing .\\nOnce for dinner and once for brunch .\\nBoth times I was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .\\nThey wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .\\nMuch of the time it seems like they do not care about you .\\nThe dinner was ok , nothing I would have again .\\nI had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .\\nThis was a great surprise .\\nWith the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .\\nThe service was attentive .\\nI look forward to eating here again .\\nPlanet Thai is great !\\nWe love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !\\nThe svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !\\nTry the Pad Thai , it \\'s fabulous and their prices are so cheap !\\nJust because it \\'s cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , IT IS GREAT !\\nJust remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .\\nIt \\'s popular w/the late crowd .\\nThey forgot a sandwich , did n\\'t include plastic forks , and did n\\'t include pita with the hummus platter .\\nAlso , the sandwiches -LRB- nearing $ 7 -RRB- did n\\'t come with anything like chips or a side .\\nOverall , not worth the money .\\nEating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it \\'s a very disappointing experience .\\nI love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it .\\nChennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city .\\nThey have authentic Indian at amazin prices .\\nThis restaurant is VEGETARIAN ; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever .\\nThe seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .\\nIt \\'s a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early .\\nPatroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .\\nThe food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate .\\nThis is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .\\nNot a great place for family or general dining .\\nLLOOVVE THIS PLACE .\\nFood is excellent .\\nFish is so very fresh .\\nWaitstaff are very friendly .\\nLove YUKA .\\nMermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .\\nThe menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .\\nThe lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great .\\nThe service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .\\nThe only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .\\nEven though its good seafood , the prices are too high .\\nThe lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .\\nWent to Village last night for my birthday .\\nWe picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n\\'t sure what to expect .\\nWe were very pleasantly surprised .\\nThe food was delicious -LRB- I had a halibut special , my husband had steak -RRB- , and the service was top-notch .\\nWhen my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .\\nTruly the mark of an attentive waiter .\\nI highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .\\nWe ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .\\nWe thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods .\\nWhy ?\\nThey do n\\'t concern much of customer \\'s health , just want to make money .\\nplease do n\\'t fool us .\\nI visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke .\\nI recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .\\nThe food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .\\nOf course , it is crowded but who cares .\\nAuthentic Shanghai style and I can not recommend a better Shanghai place in New York .\\nHave frequented ` ino for several years and the food remains excellent .\\nCheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .\\nThe large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .\\n-LRB- The asparagus , truffle oil , parmesan bruschetta is a winner ! -RRB-\\nWine list is extensive without being over-priced .\\nBe sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials .\\nDefinitely a neighborhood favorite .\\nI loved this place !!\\nI almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .\\nThe food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .\\nThe wait staff is very freindly , they make it feel like you \\'re eating in a freindly little european town .\\nI like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent !!\\nThe service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .\\nThe waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .\\nAfter dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : Where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in America ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .\\nWe did tip , I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager .\\nThe whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .\\nPizza here is consistently good .\\nSalads are a delicious way to begin the meal .\\nYou should pass on the calamari .\\nIt is thick and slightly soggy .\\nDecor is charming .\\nService is average .\\nWhat a great place .\\nI came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband .\\nThe ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .\\nI was n\\'t thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that \\'s the price you pay for a popular place .\\nI would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine !\\nI was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .\\nA gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .\\nWhen asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not Mcdonald \\'s , every place makes things differently .\\nWhile it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .\\nThe service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald \\'s than this joint .\\nNever again !\\nI absolutely Loved this place .\\nMy friends spoke so much about it for months , I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in .\\nExcellent atmosphere , delicious dishes good and friendly service .\\nthis is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions .\\nI think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .\\nThe wine list is also really nice .\\nA friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8:30 .\\nEverything was wonderful ; food , drinks , staff , mileau .\\nI would highly recommend this place !\\nI have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there .\\nThe food is great and reasonably priced .\\nI have tried to make reservations , but both times , the hostess did n\\'t have my name .\\nIf the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .\\nThe staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .\\nMy boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent .\\nFrom the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .\\nConsidering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time , the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed .\\nI highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .\\nNice Family owned traditional restaurant .\\nFresh ingredients and everything is made to order .\\nI was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .\\nFriendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you \\'re with .\\nMy friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend .\\nI found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish I had .\\nI also ordered the Change Mojito , which was out of this world .\\nMy friends settled for rice dishes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was good ... not outstanding , but good .\\nWe ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it \\'s cool and the music is hear well there .\\nOverall , excellent restaurant !\\ni went to utsav about a yr ago with my family .\\nThe food was good .\\nThe place was nice and calm .\\nbut the service was a bit slow .\\nI work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time .\\nThe buffet had a nice selection .\\nThe food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .\\nService was also very good .\\nI would go back .\\nI got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .\\nI would recommend Roxy \\'s for that , but not for their food .\\nMy son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !\\nBut , they were too big for the bun .\\nConsequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ` nt feel like finishing them .\\nAlso they were $ 15 each !\\nI had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .\\nIt was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it did n\\'t have much taste-I \\'ve had better for less elsewhere !\\nThis place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .\\nThe last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .\\nAnd the Tom Kha soup was pathetic .\\nIf you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go .\\nWe went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .\\nThe pesto pizza was excellent , thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I \\'d never heard of before .\\nConveniently located too , being right on Bedford ave .\\nTHe back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden .\\nI will definetly be going back .\\nWe had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC .\\nMy husband said he could \\'ve eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .\\nWe had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .\\nI recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .\\nWe waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right .\\nWe will be back .\\nlove the food .\\nit \\'s the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food .\\nit helps if you know what to order .\\nand you ca n\\'t beat the prices .\\nhighly recommended .\\nI \\'ve lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all .\\nGreat food , good size menu , great service and an unpretensious setting .\\nThe dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream -LRB- the best and freshest I \\'ve ever had -RRB- .\\nI \\'m glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY .\\nWe have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets , and Joya is the best .\\nThe freshest , best variety , and the fastest delivery .\\nAlso very inexpensive .\\nA great choice at any cost and a great deal .\\nThe service was excellent and the food was delicious .\\nWe are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix -LRB- special -RRB- , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .\\nOverall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .\\nDefinitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date .\\nAverage to good Thai food , but terrible delivery .\\nI \\'ve waited over one hour for food .\\nThey were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .\\nA Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner ?\\nThe food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .\\ni actually feel like i should keep it a secret .\\nThis is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money .\\nAn excellent service .\\nWent to Cafe Spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night .\\nWe were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial .\\nShe was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food .\\nWe were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry .\\nThe food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .\\nWe ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun -LRB- dessert -RRB- recommended by the waiter .\\nI thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .\\nI went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n\\'t get a table .\\nService here was great , food was fantastic .\\nGuacamole + shrimp appetizer was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n\\'t much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .\\nWill absolutely visit again .\\nMaybe tomorrow ;--RRB- .\\nYou can not go wrong with this place .\\nThe food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional .\\nAlways a nice crowd , but never loud .\\nGo here .\\nGood for dates or with friends .\\nI am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded .\\nHowever , it is jus too good to not praise it .\\nBy far , the best pizza in Manhattan .\\nThe crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .\\nFor all you lazy folks that do n\\'t want to come to Alphabet City , I say , good - stay out .\\nless wait time for me !\\nWe arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly .\\nThe menu has so many fish items and oysters .\\nWe all ordered different entrees so we could share .\\nThe fish was really , really fresh .\\nI lived in Maine for ten years and grew up on fish .\\nWe all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York .\\nI stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood .\\nAll of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !\\nI highly recommend the Sophia pizza .\\nIt \\'s to die for !\\nThe food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .\\nImmediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .\\nThere are other people waiting !\\nWe were n\\'t even at our table for more than an hour total .\\nAs we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we \\'re not in a hurry .\\nOur friends have not arrived yet .\\nSo rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary !\\nFor the people who want great food plus great service , Roxy is a place to AVOID !\\nI \\'ve been here twice now .\\nThe first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .\\nI \\'m sure I \\'ll return for a final judgement tho .\\nThe blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .\\nMizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy .\\nWhile their kitchen food is delicious , their Sushi is out of this world .\\nMizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .\\nNot only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .\\nWarning : You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu !\\nThalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food does n\\'t quite match up .\\nI ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor .\\nThe entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .\\nI expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu .\\nThe view is spectacular , and the food is great .\\nWonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !\\nDefinitely worth the trip to Battery Park City !\\nOne of my favorite places in Manhattan .\\nAuthentic Taiwanese food that \\'s cheap ... what more could you ask for ?\\n-LRB- Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city -RRB- .\\nThe cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan .\\ndelicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .\\nKind , attentive wait staff .\\nI really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi -LRB- on saffron risotto-yum -RRB- .\\nMy friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos .\\nDelicious crab cakes too .\\nEven if the food was n\\'t this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .\\nGreat neighborhood joint .\\nThis is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice .\\nTheir calzones are horrific , bad , vomit-inducing , YUCK .\\nThey smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .\\nThe counter service is bad .\\nThey charge different prices all the time .\\nThey \\'re rude at times , and not very friendly .\\nNO PIZZA 33 for me !\\nAnybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary .\\nThe dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I \\'d drink popcorn topping before I \\'d eat another one of these .\\nThe sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced .\\nCalling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .\\nSeriously , this place kicks ass .\\nThe atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant .\\nBest Italian food I ever had -LRB- and being Italian , that means alot -RRB- .\\nIt is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .\\nThis is such a lovely , peaceful place to eat outside .\\nThe restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .\\nIt is set far from the small street it \\'s on , and there is no traffic noise .\\nThe food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .\\nThis is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .\\nGreat sushi experience .\\nNice value .\\nUnique apppetizers .\\nTry sushimi cucumber roll .\\nGood spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .\\nTHE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .\\nI complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted .\\nMurray wo n\\'t do it .\\nWo n\\'t or Ca n\\'t is not in the service directory .\\nBut who says Murray \\'s is anything about service .\\nSo close , but not good enough .\\nDo n\\'t be fooled by crowds of people .\\nThe service is awful .\\nThis place is not worth the prices .\\nAlso , do n\\'t plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it \\'s not on the menu , you ca n\\'t have it .\\nLove Pizza 33 ... .\\nI will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing ... their Pizza .\\nI live in the neightborhood and am a regular .\\nIt hits the spot every time .\\nThis tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .\\nThe pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC .\\nEven the pasta is delicious here -LRB- a rarity in New York pizza restaurants -RRB- .\\nI \\'ve been many time and have never been disappointed .\\nCompared to Ess-a , Tal offers a less doughy bagel !\\nThey even scoop it out nice -LRB- for those on a diet -RRB- not too much not to little .\\nThe cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee !!\\nA little crowded but they move that line really fast !\\nA little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning !\\nBagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !\\nI asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !\\nBe sure not to get anything other than bagels ... !\\nthe turkey burgers are scary !\\nThe worst excuse for Japanese food I \\'ve ever encountered .\\nThe soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .\\nThe sushi was awful !\\nThe rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .\\nFurthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .\\nThe fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .\\nIt is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine .\\nGood , fast service .\\nI would highly recommend .\\nFood is great and inexpensive .\\nThe location is perfect .\\nGive it a try and enjoy .\\nI thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience .\\nJimmy is Dominican !\\nWell , this place is so Ghetto its not even funny .\\nIf you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you \\'ll love it here .\\nWould NEVER go back there .\\nToo bad Latin Quarters closed .\\nThat place was awesome , , , sally !\\nAwsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice .\\nAlways busy but fast moving .\\nGreat atmoshere and worth every bit .\\nOpen late -LRB- well as late as I ever got there and I \\'m a night person -RRB- .\\nWinnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .\\nThe food is reliable and the price is moderate .\\nWhat more can you ask for ?\\nFor authentic Thai food , look no further than Toons .\\nIve been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before , and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had -LRB- except for my mom \\'s of course -RRB- .\\nTry the Pad Thai , or sample anything on the appetizer menu ... they \\'re all delicious .\\nEverything about this restaurant was special .\\nThe service was attentive , yet discreet .\\nThe flavors robust and subtle .\\nThe brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .\\nI \\'m saving up for my next visit .\\nI went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .\\nThe place was quiet and delightful .\\nService was good and food is wonderful .\\nI did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad -LRB- they are all good -RRB- .\\nIt is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat .\\nAs a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city .\\nThe wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous -LRB- in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she\\'s-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way -RRB- .\\nThe food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .\\nBut the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs .\\nYou can get a completely delish martini in a glass -LRB- that \\'s about 2.1/2 drinks -RRB- for $ 8.50 -LRB- I recommend the Vanilla Shanty , mmmm ... -RRB- in a great homey setting with great music .\\nThe in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .\\nYou ca n\\'t go wrong with this place .\\nSuan is a great place that I often take my friends -LRB- classmates -RRB- too .\\nIts location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .\\nI LOVE their Thai .\\nnoodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !\\nI was in love with Pongsri on 48th , but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced .\\nI will go back to Suan soon !\\nIn summer-eat outside on a terrace -LRB- another great feature of Suan -RRB- !!!\\nI can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .\\nI can not imagine better Indian food in all of the city .\\nI can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .\\nThis restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location .\\nDuring the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .\\nI wish they would change back to what it was before .\\nThe food now is inconsistent .\\nThis is the kind of place you \\'d like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .\\nThe setting is casual and romantic .\\nPrices are very good .\\nThe food is excellent !\\nif you \\'re daring , try the balsamic vinegar over icecream , it \\'s wonderful !\\nDo not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .\\nThey were such a rip-off -LRB- $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns -RRB- and not worth trying .\\nThe rest of the dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it .\\nSteamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table .\\nThe wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n\\'t like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek -LRB- for Chinatown -RRB- alternative .\\nA few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards .\\nThese are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner : .\\n-LRB- 1 -RRB- turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard .\\n-LRB- 2 -RRB- egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal .\\nAfter passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner .\\nI was pleasantly suprised .\\nThe food was exceptional .\\nThe menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc. .\\nI choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .\\nThe service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .\\nThe restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal .\\nthis little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .\\nthe pad se ew chicken was delicious , however the pad thai was far too oily .\\ni would just ask for no oil next time .\\nHave eaten at Ginger House several times , and it \\'s always good .\\nThe fried dumplings are GREAT !\\nFinally a reliable Chinese restaurant !\\nThis place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .\\nThe only thing you can do here is walk in and eat ... but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it .\\nThey are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !\\nNobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .\\nTerrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .\\nNever fails to please .\\ndelicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .\\nSpreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .\\nService is fast and friendly .\\nOnly drawback - they wo n\\'t toast your bagel , and they do n\\'t make eggs for the bagel .\\nBut that is highly forgivable .\\nBeen there , done that , and New York , it \\'s not that big a deal .\\nThe food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it \\'s a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , I thought it was just annoying .\\nIf celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you \\'ll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .\\nRao is a good restaurant , but it \\'s nothing special .\\nI \\'ve eaten at many different Indian restaurants .\\nBut after last night , Spice Grill is the only place I \\'m eating indian cuisine .\\nYou must try the shrimp appetizers .\\nEven my Indian friend could n\\'t believe how good and tasty everything was .\\nThis place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .\\nGreat food , great prices , great service .\\nIf you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place .\\nit \\'s a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food .\\nI really loved the different and inovated touch that \\'s the cheff gives to the food .\\nalso it \\'s great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place , the service it \\'s just perfect ... they \\'re so frendly that we never want to live the place !\\nI love Ess-a-bagel , but I live on the west side , so I often go to Murray \\'s for convenience .\\nTheir bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ` special \\' bagel experience .\\nBetter than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .\\nAlso a little more expensive than your average bagel place .\\nGreat bagels made the old-fashioned way .\\nThe appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price -LRB- if bought by the pound -RRB- .\\nDrawbacks : service is slow and they do n\\'t toast !\\nThe food was absolutely amazing !!\\nThe baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we \\'ve ever had !!\\nThe lamb was tender so full of flavor , the dessert was divine !!\\nThe waiter was attentive .\\nThe place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .\\nDowntown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix : Appetizers were ok , waiter gave me poor suggestion ... try the potato stuff kanish best one .\\nSmall servings for main entree , i had salmon -LRB- wasnt impressed -RRB- girlfriend had chicken , it was good .\\nDessert is a joke ... dont bother .\\nVolare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n\\'t ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .\\nThe restaurant has a Family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine .\\nThe anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .\\nThe wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .\\nStill , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ... .\\nFantastic place .\\nCute and decorative .\\nA pleasant surprise .\\nGo there to relax and feel like your somewhere else .\\nLucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat .\\nYeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n\\'t .\\nGreat food , great decor , great service .\\nI recommend it !\\nJust ignore the trendy wannabes .\\nThis is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !\\n-LRB- Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer !!!\\nGuaranteed to be a tasty experience ! -RRB-\\nExcellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you have n\\'t seen in a while .\\nI have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED !\\nAll the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends !\\nGo there once and oh yes ... you will go back ... you will ... .\\nWhat a great place !\\nNot the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant .\\nA cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .\\nAnd even with it \\'s Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !\\nLoved it !\\nOut of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best .\\nThe shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .\\nIt is expensive but well worth the money .\\nIf you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n\\'t seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .\\nThe only thing more wonderful than the food -LRB- which is exceptional -RRB- is the service .\\nThe only thing the waiters do n\\'t do for you is wipe your chin when you leave .\\nWonderful at holiday time .\\nCozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .\\nService was very prompt but slightly rushed .\\nFood was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world .\\nGo here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .\\nMy friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian .\\nToo bad the food was n\\'t of the same heritage .\\nThe porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle .\\nA real dissapointment .\\nBut that was n\\'t the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had .\\nThey should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies .\\nPriced at upper intermediate range .\\nI really liked this place .\\nEverything I had was good , and I \\'m a eater .\\nIt was pretty inexpensive too .\\nThis place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city .\\nI also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee -LRB- rice porridge -RRB- .\\nIt \\'s great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .\\nIt \\'s definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .\\nHowever , if you want great food at a great price and do n\\'t mind the decor , you ca n\\'t beat this place .\\nQuick and friendly service .\\nThis is one of the best comfort food places in the city .\\nIt \\'s somewhere you can eat and be happy .\\nWhen I \\'m feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , I head for Cafe St. Bart \\'s .\\nWhen you \\'re sitting in their main dining room -LRB- which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling -RRB- you \\'d never know there was a world outside .\\nThe food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .\\nI ca n\\'t wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .\\nAhhh ... .\\nI recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great .\\nThis little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .\\nThe service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .\\nI have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood .\\nThey all know you .\\nGood food .\\nGood drink .\\nHow do you rate home ?\\nI have never had cheescake like this .\\nI thought I had died and gone to heaven .\\nGreat spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .\\nWarm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .\\nThe food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .\\nHave been several times and it never dissapoints .\\nAfter hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .\\nWe were less than impressed .\\nWhile the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .\\nWe ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone .\\nProbably would not go again ... .\\ni \\'ve been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good .\\nstick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .\\ni do n\\'t usually order wine with indian so i ca n\\'t comment on their wine list or their wines .\\ninstead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .\\nservice is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table .\\ni would recommend reservations on weekends though .\\nskip dessert .\\nBest Reuben sandwich ever !\\nA classic !\\nDo n\\'t miss Bloom \\'s on your next trip to Manhatten .\\nIt was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York .\\nThanks Bloom \\'s for a lovely trip .\\nAs a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .\\nThe food was not fresh , the sauces were bland and very oily .\\nIt just was n\\'t Thai .\\nWent to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza -LRB- as I love La Pizza Fresca -RRB- .\\nWas surprisingly disappointed .\\nPizza was a little soggy .\\nRavioli was good ... but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced .\\nNot enough wines by the glass either .\\nService , however , was excellent ... and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot .\\nFood was just average ... if they lowered the prices just a bit , it would be a bigger draw .\\nThis place is a great bargain .\\nAuthentic Pakistani food .\\nPeople are always friendly .\\nDo n\\'t waste money on decor .\\nJust straight up cheap , good food .\\nFaan is sooo good .\\nThe best pad thai i \\'ve ever had .\\nThe design and atmosphere is just as good .\\nbottles of wine are cheap and good .\\nWhat more could you want ?\\nThe food was actually aweful .\\nI \\'m not picky - but it was actually gross .\\nThe mussles were the fishiest things I \\'ve ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w / chicken had bones in it ... It was disgusting .\\nNice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .\\nWould n\\'t recomend it for dinner !\\nThis is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples .\\nThe jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes .\\nThe food is amazing , rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza .\\nBest of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .\\nIf only they delivered , they \\'d make a mint !\\ngo here for the drinks !\\nespecially during happy hour !\\nenough said !\\nthe drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .\\nAsk for Usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan .\\nMy fav was the sassy lassi ... .\\nThis is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .\\nI really recommend the very simple Unda -LRB- Egg -RRB- rolls .\\nDelicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .\\nAmazing !\\nToons has recently been redone , so it \\'s now a very attractive space .\\nThe food \\'s as good as ever .\\nIn an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food , this is one of the best spots .\\nWent here last night - nice decor , good service , but the food was surprisingly excellent .\\nThe portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split -LRB- rather than one appetizer and entree per person -RRB- for two people .\\nAmong all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money .\\nCa n\\'t wait to go back .\\nBest drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !\\nBeef noodle soup is good as well .\\nThe service is good and the resturant is clean .\\nBest Taiwanese food in NY !\\nI have been to Rao \\'s probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better .\\nFor those that go once and do n\\'t enjoy it , all I can say is that they just do n\\'t get it .\\nRao \\'s has the best service and atmosphere in NYC .\\nGood luck getting a table .\\nMy roommate and I LOVE this place .\\nWe recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .\\nIndoor was very cozy and cute .\\nThe portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good .\\nWhile it \\'s not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .\\nStaff is very accomodating .\\nExcellent dumplings served amid clean , chic decor .\\nI got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .\\nBut $ 1 for each small piece ???\\nNot worth it .\\nI wo n\\'t go back unless someone else is footing the bill .\\nI came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .\\nThe decor is very simple but comfortable .\\nThe food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .\\nThe portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .\\nYou must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .\\nThe staff there is very attentive and down to earth .\\nI loved it and would go again .\\nGreat Indian food and the service is incredible .\\nThe owner truly caters to all your needs .\\nWhen family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .\\nEveryone was more then happy with his choices .\\nGreat food and the prices are very reasonable .\\nObviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong , it actually means Great Prosperity .\\nThe food here does a great service to the name -LRB- Cantonese that is ... -RRB- .\\nI fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork .\\nThis dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it .\\nTry the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread .\\nSimply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices ... .\\nService is not what you are coming here for ... .\\nJust make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that \\'s all the service I need ... .\\nBig Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach .\\nthis place ... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend .\\nwhoever the jazz duo was , they were on POINT .\\ngood music , great food , speedy service affordable prices .\\neven the wine by the glass was good .\\nits a little out of the way if you do n\\'t live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .\\nConsistently good Japanese Tapas .\\nSame owner as the guy who owns Typhoon , which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave. .\\nAlways good drinks and service is pretty good ; .\\nAtmosphere is nice and relaxed too ... .\\nA great place to meet up for some food and drinks ... .\\nYakitori -LRB- bbq meats -RRB- is tasty too .\\nIt \\'s also attached to Angel \\'s Share , which is a cool , more romantic bar ... .\\nJust moved to the neighborhood and we \\'ve been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants .\\nIf you do n\\'t mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .\\nPrice and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .\\nWas n\\'t going to share but I feel obligated ... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing .\\nNo thanks !!!\\nThis place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps Queens \\' biggest secret !\\nFabulous decor - makes you feel like you \\'re in a trendy Manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply-priced , generally friendly staff , and if you \\'re a Manhattanite , or spend most of your time in Manhattan , Rice Avenue will make you feel at home ... very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ... all on Roosevelt Avenue !\\nWe were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .\\nWe were then shooed inside .\\nOne would think we \\'d get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n\\'t even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .\\nWe left , never to return .\\nWith so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n\\'t need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n\\'t recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n\\'t care .\\nI am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .\\nIf you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave. .\\nGreat bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in .\\nYou fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town .\\nHowever it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town .\\nThe food is okay and the prices here are mediocre .\\nYou ca n\\'t say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .\\nThey \\'re are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing , Queens .\\nBaluchi \\'s has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .\\nThe only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent .\\nHe offers subpar service and has no personality .\\nIn fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .\\nSkip this location and go to the one in Soho .\\nThere is no excuse for such lousy service !\\nI have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri .\\nStuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .\\nYou can do it here .\\n$ 20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten .\\nI went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there .\\nThe restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .\\nMost of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive .\\nThe atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd , but there were a few groups of mid 20 \\'s / 30 year olds also .\\nThe vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !\\nMe and my girls will definitely go back .\\nFood was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went .\\nI would highly recommand requesting a table by the window .\\nAlthough they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .\\nI \\'ve eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times , but more often I order delivery .\\nThe food is great .\\nPersonal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .\\nI heartily recommend .\\nThere is a downside if you \\'re ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude .\\nNever have I had such dramatic delivery guys -LRB- a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup -RRB- who always seem disappointed with their tips .\\nHey , I think $ 2 + for a 5 block walk ai n\\'t bad .\\nLove the scene first off - the place has a character and nice light to it ... very fortunate , location wise .\\nThe pizza was pretty good and huge .\\nThe price very reasonable .\\nWe were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally .\\nWe got most of it back at home with us .\\nI would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n\\'t not mention or undermine .\\nThe pasta penne was pretty extra buttery , creamy which means a big task to diggest ... tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count , penne ... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed ... lol .\\nNo , really .\\nI have eaten a lot of pizza here .\\nLa Rosa waltzes in , and I think they are doing it the best .\\nInteresting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .\\nI have been twice to this restaurant .\\nI love it .\\nI plan on stopping by next week as well .\\nI found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up .\\nI recieved prompt service with a smile .\\nTo me it exemplifies Soho , cute , artsy , interesting .\\nDefinately check it out !!!\\nThis place blew me away ... by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side .\\nThe wine list is extensive and impressive .\\nLOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris .\\nThe mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert ... definitely going to be back very soon .\\nI just read Mocaramel \\'s review and felt compelled to respond .\\nI have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna .\\nOver the years the host , Vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he \\'s even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .\\nI \\'ve also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : A new Jazz Bar , the most fantastic Dining Garden , the Best Thin Crust Pizzas , and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for -LRB- these are not your average lasagnas -RRB- !\\nI lOVE THIS PLACE !\\nKeep up the good work guys !\\nMy girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night .\\nI have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here .\\nWe could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .\\nLuckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon , Sea Bass and Crispy Duck .\\nWe got a little tipsy from the sake but is n\\'t that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?\\nLove Al Di La .\\nI recommend this place to everyone .\\nGreat food .\\nOne of my favorite places in Brooklyn .\\nThe pastas are incredible , the risottos -LRB- particularly the sepia -RRB- are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing .\\nOverpriced and not tasty .\\nThe food here was mediocre at best .\\nIt was totally overpriced - fish and chips was about $ 15 ... .\\nThere are so many other great places to go to eat and drink ... this place is not worth it ... .\\nTasty Dog !\\nAn awesome organic dog , and a conscious eco friendly establishment .\\nOne of the best hot dogs I have ever eaten .\\nCa n\\'t wait to go back .\\nThe Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it .\\nBut the best pork souvlaki I ever had is the main thing .\\nTrust me .\\nRun do n\\'t walk .\\nSuper YUMMY Pizza !\\nI was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant .\\nI LOOOVE their eggplant pizza , as well as their pastas !\\nWe had half/half pizza , mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza !\\nWe had fun eating in there , we were there like around 3 a.m. in the morning !\\nWill comeback for sure , wish they have it here in LA. .\\nExcellent food , although the interior could use some help .\\nThe space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting , without it trying to be that .\\nI paid just about $ 60 for a good meal , though :-RRB- .\\nGreat sake !\\nReliable , Fresh Sushi .\\nMy husband and I take out from here 3-4 times a month .\\nThe sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious .\\nHave never had a problem with service save a missing rice once .\\nDelivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week .\\nDelivery guy sometimes get upset if you do n\\'t tip more than 10 % .\\nWe \\'ve found it to be better and fresher than Kiku which is comparable in price .\\nBest ... Sushi ... Ever .\\nThis place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi .\\nCreative , consistent , fresh .\\nExcellent sashimi , and the millennium roll is beyond delicious .\\nNot cheap but very yummy .\\nLove it .\\nVery , very nice .\\nThe place is a bit hidden away , but once you get there , it \\'s all worth it .\\nnot only is the food .\\nLoved It .\\nMy wife and I went to Water \\'s Edge for a romantic dinner .\\nWe had a very nice time .\\nThe waiter was attentive , the food was delicious and the views of the city were great .\\nI \\'d definitely go back again .\\nGreat place to relax and enjoy your dinner .\\nThere is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week .\\nPlace is open till late , no dress code .\\nGood food : my favorite is the seafood spaghetti .\\nHighly recommended !\\nExcellent food for great prices .\\nMy husband and I have been sold on this from the first visit .\\nThe wait staff is very courteous and accomodating .\\nThe space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour , but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food .\\nThere are no negatives to speak of .\\nthe bestt !\\nmy favorite place lol .\\ni love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good .\\nits alright .\\nim not necessarily fanatical about this place , but it was a fun time for low pirces .\\nlobster was good , nothing spectacular .\\nits just a fun place to go , not a five star restaraunt .\\nWay below average .\\nI think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked .\\nHad no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive .\\nWould NEVER go back .\\nI love this place .\\nI was n\\'t here for the pizza so I ca n\\'t comment on that yet but what I had was very good .\\nThe service was quick and friendly .\\nEveryone was smiling so that made me feel welcome .\\nI thought the restaurant was nice and clean .\\nI ordered the vitello alla marsala and I was pretty impressed .\\nThe veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly .\\nThe potato balls were not dry at all ... in fact it was buttery .\\nThe only downside ... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time .\\nI \\'ll be back for sure .\\nWORST PLACE ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN .\\nVery immature bartender , didnt know how to make specific drinks , service was so slowwwww , the food was not fresh or warm , waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers .\\nI would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner .\\nawesome .\\nthe food is always fresh ... .\\noverpriced japanese food with mediocre service .\\nWent here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed .\\nChicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top ??\\nfood was luke warm .\\nThe waitress was not attentive at all .\\nI was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have .\\nToo many other good places to have to settle .\\nNot because you are `` The Four Seasons \\'\\' ... -- you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner .\\nThe food was excellent as well as service , however , I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed .\\nI do not think dinner in Manhattan should cost $ 400.00 where I am not swept off my feet .\\nRed Dragon Roll - my favorite thing to eat , of any food group - hands down .\\nJust go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll .\\nIf you do n\\'t like it , I do n\\'t know what to tell you .\\nThe Seafood Dynamite is also otherworldly .\\nI \\'m not even going to bother to describe it ; it speaks for itself .\\nFavorite Sushi in NYC .\\nI have eaten at some of the ` best \\' sushi joints in NYC -LRB- Nobu , Bond Street , JewelBako , etc -RRB- and Yamato is my favorite .\\nAn unpretentious spot in Park Slope , the sushi is consistently good , the service is pleasant , effective and unassuming .\\nIn the summer months , the back garden area is really nice .\\nThe rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food .\\nThe Dancing , White River and Millenium rolls are musts .\\nSO GOOD .\\nI CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE ... -RRB- .\\nGross food -- Wow - .\\nI ca n\\'t remember the last time I had such gross food in New York .\\nMy quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor .\\nAnd $ 11 for a plate of bland guacamole ?\\nCome on .\\nDo n\\'t get me started on the margaritas , either .\\nMine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .\\nReally , I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds -- this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one .\\nSave your money and your time and go somewhere else .\\nOh , and I never write reviews -- I just was so moved by how bad this place was , I felt it was my duty to spread the word .\\nGreat Indian Food !\\nThis place was reccomended to me by a friend .\\nWhen I got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly .\\nThe food was good , the place was clean and affordable .\\nI noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place !\\nThis is one of my favorite spot , very relaxing the food is great all the times , celebrated my engagement and my wedding here , it was very well organized .\\nThe staff is very good .\\nLove their drink menu .\\nI highly recommend this beautiful place .\\nNice for one time special occasion .\\nWent for Mom \\'s birthday brunch/lunch .\\nThey honored reservation on Sunday afternoon very well .\\nBe aware .\\nWe were offered water for the table but were not told the Voss bottles of water were $ 8 a piece .\\nFood was OK .\\nNice view of river and NYC .\\nI come here enjoy very much with husband .\\nRemind me of home .\\nGreat survice .\\nMMMMMMMMMmmmmmm so delicious .\\nA beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night .\\nWatch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that \\'s more lemony than smoky .\\nOh , and there \\'s hookah .\\nRaymond the bartender rocks !\\nPacifico is a great place to casually hang out .\\nThe drinks are great , especially when made by Raymond .\\nThe omlette for brunch is great ... .\\nthe spinach is fresh , definately not frozen ... .\\nquacamole at pacifico is yummy , as are the wings with chimmichuri .\\nA weakness is the chicken in the salads .\\nIt \\'s just average , just shredded , no seasoning on it .\\nAlso , I personally was n\\'t a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole .\\nOverall , decent food at a good price , with friendly people .\\nBest Indian Restaurant in the City .\\nDecor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing !\\nThis small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York .\\nSmall , bright , and clean , BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints , both in Astoria and out .\\nWhat really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house -LRB- even the gyro meat and sausages -RRB- , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .\\nAll the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come -- if you do n\\'t eat one your trip was wasted .\\nBest restaurant in Brooklyn .\\nThe best !\\nGreat food , amazing service , this place is a class act .\\nThe veal was incredible last night .\\nFresh , mind blowing flavors .\\nThis place is a must visit !\\nYou want to have a real hot dog in Brooklyn ?\\nSkip Nathan \\'s ... you can get that at the mall ... go to Bark .\\nDelicious , creative and fun .\\nGot a date ... Go here !\\nEvery time I have a special occasion with my boyfriend I have a hard time going anywhere else .\\nIt is so romantic .\\nIts dark , and cozy ... there is always jazz music playing when we go .\\nMost of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like ` that \\' couple .\\nThe food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together .\\nI \\'ve enjoyed 99 % of the dishes we \\'ve ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish -LRB- I \\'m a daring eater but not THAT daring -RRB- .\\nOnce you try it for a special occasion beware ... you ca n\\'t stop !\\nYou \\'ll be ther for every anniversary , birthday , valentines day ... .\\nFor a Fabulous Wedding !\\nMy daughter \\'s wedding reception at Water \\'s Edge received the highest compliments from our guests .\\nEveryone raved about the atmosphere -LRB- elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views -RRB- and the fabulous food !\\nService was wonderful ; .\\neveryone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .\\nPaul , the maitre d\\' , was totally professional and always on top of things .\\nThank you everyone at Water \\'s Edge .\\nRuth , mother of the Bride .\\nwould NOT go back .\\nService ok but unfriendly , filthy bathroom .\\nThe high prices you \\'re going to pay is for the view not for the food .\\nThe bar drinks were Eh , ok to say the least .\\nThe stuff tilapia was horrid ... tasted like cardboard .\\nWe thought the dessert would be better , Wrong !\\n$ 170 down the toilet ... .\\noh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting .\\nThe floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .\\nGo to son cubano in edgewater nj instead .\\nGood Experience .\\nDuring our trip to NYC , we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the Four Seasons for their pre-theater menu -LRB- offering a modified menu for $ 65 pp -RRB- .\\nThe wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings .\\nThe bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the `` free \\'\\' appetizer of olives was disappointing .\\nHowever , our main course was wonderful .\\nI had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations .\\nThe dessert -LRB- we had a pear torte -RRB- was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .\\nWhen we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .\\nNot what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location .\\nAll in all , I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .\\nshort and sweet -- seating is great : it \\'s romantic , cozy and private .\\nThe boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they \\'re perfect for 2 people .\\nThe service was extremely fast and attentive -LRB- thanks to the service button on your table -RRB- but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .\\nThe food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy .\\nover .\\nOver all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .\\nSo what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food .\\nWill probably not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once .\\nImpressed ... .\\nSubtle food and service .\\nNoodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy .\\nServers are all different , Greg is my favorite .\\nSometimes tables do n\\'t understand his sense of humor but it \\'s refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner .\\nThis is the first place I \\'ve been that a runner remembers my order ... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant .\\nPrices are fair across the board for both food and bev .\\nI go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .\\nRestaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place .\\namazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings !!!\\nthis place had ALL the trimmings and i mean all .\\npeppers , onions , relish , chilli , cheeses , you NAME it .\\namazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out !!!!\\nBEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE !\\nStepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York !\\nHighly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had !\\nThe have a great cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for !\\nFood took some time to prepare , all worth waiting for .\\nWe were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .\\nI never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !\\nGreat find in the West Village !\\nMaggot in the food !\\nI \\'ve been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table .\\nThe menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .\\nNevertheless , I finished my plate , and that \\'s when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .\\nI showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts -LRB- but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for -RRB- .\\nWhen the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I did n\\'t think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .\\nYes , I ate the food , but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating , and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach .\\nThe manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine -LRB- which cost less than the food -RRB- , and made it seem like a big concession .\\nWe paid and left because we did n\\'t feel like arguing any more .\\nI have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .\\nFor a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .\\nA fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes , Flatbush Farm is n\\'t in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world , but it \\'s pretty good , albeit with a somewhat dismal setting .\\nUnhygienic .\\nI do not recommend .\\nI went there 2times .\\nI got hair in my food 2 times of then !\\nGreat place , great value .\\nThe food is flavorful , plentiful and reasonably priced .\\nThe atmosphere is relaxed and casual .\\nIt \\'s a great place to order from or sit-in .\\nAwesome .\\nInexpensive , unassuming , great time !\\nSushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance .\\nTry it !\\nVery pleased .\\nGood creative rolls !\\nYamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi , or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much .\\nThey have great rolls , the triple color and norwegetan rolls , are awesome and filling .\\nOne special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !\\nThey have a delicious banana chocolate dessert , as well as a great green tea tempura .\\nThe appetizers are also delicious !\\nAmazing food .\\nMazing interior .\\nGreat food !\\nI \\'ve had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers .\\nThe atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .\\nIf you \\'re into being lost when you \\'re just five feet from your table then hey , that \\'s a good thing .\\nDespite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future .\\nAnother review here claimed the pre-fix was $ 29/per person including sake but it is $ 55 per person not including sake .\\nIndo Chinese food , pretty good ... .\\nNot a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food .\\nThe chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes -LRB- I have to agree with a previous reviewer -RRB- are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the Chilli Chicken .\\nMy mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she -LRB- being Indian -RRB- feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .\\nStill we keep going back :-RRB- .\\nI was speechless by the horrible food .\\nI attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .\\nRather than eating the meat entree being offered , I requested a vegetarian dish .\\nRather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables -LRB- minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation -RRB- .\\nI was so stunned , and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .\\nThis place survives on reputation alone .\\nI will NEVER return .\\nBest In ALL of NYC .\\nThis is the MOST wonderful restaurant in all of New York City , not just Brooklyn ... .\\nfor 7 years they have put out the most tasty , most delicious food and kept it that way ... .\\nnever swaying , never a bad meal , never bad service ... .\\nI \\'m telling you ... .\\nyou should travel from the Bronx to try it ... .\\ngreat food , great wine list , great service in a great neighborhood ... .\\nso delicious !!!!!!\\nPatsy \\'s Pizza = true love .\\nHands down the best pizza on the planet .\\nMy bf and I go to the walk-up counter and order a pie .\\nIn about 12 minutes , the thing is gone .\\nNeed I say more ?\\ngreat hot dogs ... .\\nthe hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .\\ngreat toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !\\ngreat taste .\\nGreat , original taste .\\nFor me dishes a little oily , but overall dining experience good .\\nHelpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .\\nThe only thing that strikes you is the decor -LRB- not very pleasant -RRB- .\\ngreat food .\\nThis place has great indian chinese food .\\nThe flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal .\\nBe prepared to wait , because the place is pretty tiny .\\nAlso , they do not take credit card so come with cash !\\nEven though the place is not beautiful , the food speaks for itself .\\nBest Indian Chinese in the city , by far !\\nAMAZING MY FAVORITE !!!\\nI have been living in NYC for bit now and I have to say I love to go out and explore the scene .\\nI came across Village Underground by accident , now I go there all the time .\\nThe martinis are amazing and very fairly priced .\\nTHE SERVICE IS AMAZING , i \\'ve had different waiters and they were all nice , which is a rare thing in NYC .\\nThe DJ is awesome , I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back .\\nYou can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they do n\\'t make you by bottles .\\nWhich lets face it ... at times it \\'s a good thing .\\nIn the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME !!!\\nHighly recommended !\\nOne of the best , if not THE best , restaurants in Park Slope -LRB- and NY in general -RRB- .\\nEverything on the menu is great .\\nThis establishment is the real deal .\\nWish NY had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .\\nThere is `` Expensive-but-worth-it \\'\\' and there is `` Expensive-and-WTF \\'\\' ?\\nThis is a twenty-something guy that does n\\'t mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions .\\nBut $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n\\'t include Wine ?\\nAre you freaking kidding me ?\\nLook , the appetizers were really good .\\nThe entree was also very good .\\nCa n\\'t argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .\\nWhat you are paying for is the environment and the name .\\nYes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .\\n$ 500 included : .\\nDrinks : 2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $ 35 each .\\nStarters : Kobe Beef Sashimi .\\nWhich of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef .\\nSurprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe .\\nA beef Consomme .\\nEntrees : Vanison steak and Bison Steak .\\nVanison was good but not amazing .\\nBison was quite excellent however .\\nDessert : pure disaster .\\nJust not good at all .\\nSome Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all .\\nI read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .\\nI was wrong .\\nThe Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say `` I \\'ve been to the four seasons restaurant \\'\\' .\\nI wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it .\\nAll in all , the food was great -LRB- except for the dessserts -RRB- .\\nThe environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .\\nIf you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .\\nYes , it is good , but I \\'ve had better for cheaper .\\nYou would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .\\nService was just ok , it is not what you \\'d expect for $ 500 .\\nTerrible Waste of money ... scammers .\\nI agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience !\\nBUT not in a good way .\\nI am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .\\nI literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .\\nWe went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different .\\nOur visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !\\nAnd even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .\\nWe did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table .\\nAlthough we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .\\nWe were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .\\nThe place is beautiful !\\nThe hostess was very pleasant .\\nHowever , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible !\\nOnce we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !\\nSince we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .\\nOur experience did not ever get any better .\\nFor each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .\\nWe also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka .\\nAfter the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .\\nWe asked for beverages and never received them .\\nWe asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .\\nMy chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .\\nI would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .\\nBy the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka !\\nWhat we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka ... some of which we never received !\\nThe only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !\\nTo top it all off ... the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .\\nBy the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !\\nIf it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !\\nI have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .\\nMY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly !\\nI wish I COULD be refunded !\\nDo n\\'t go with a larger group than 4 !\\nI went here for a family birthday dinner .\\nFive of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a Thursday evening .\\nThe hostess said `` Wow that \\'s a large group , unless you are n\\'t together \\'\\' , to which I replied `` no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please . \\'\\'\\nAt first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .\\nThe menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .\\nThere was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .\\nNot much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma .\\nThe appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion -LRB- maybe 3 of each -RRB- .\\nThe lobster knuckles -LRB- special of the day -RRB- were ok , but pretty tasteless .\\nI believe there were 2 shrimp in the `` salt encrusted shrimp \\'\\' appetizer .\\nAfter we ate our appetizers -LRB- which took all of 8 minutes -RRB- we ordered another round of Brahma \\'s - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member .\\nThe waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order .\\nWe replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay .\\nShe replied `` well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . \\'\\'\\nWe called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to order for her , so we did .\\nThe food arrived in about 15 minutes .\\nI had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass ... which was very good .\\nEveryone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi , seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice !\\nI heard the lobster roll was excellent .\\nThey seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done -LRB- my sister still had her fork in hand -RRB- .\\nAll in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh .\\nService not the friendliest to our `` large party \\'\\' !\\nProbably would not go back here .\\nGreat Indian food .\\nI lived on 50th st , and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out .\\nFood was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly , but I can say this is one of the best I \\'ve had .\\nVery `` normal Indian food \\'\\' , but done really well .\\nI have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price -LRB- just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 -RRB- , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does n\\'t have an upscale feel .\\nAlso , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .\\nI do n\\'t appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron \\'s knowledge so that was a huge turnoff -LRB- more than the price -RRB- .\\nBut if you \\'re prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food .\\nOne of the BEST .\\nBukhara Grill , the tagline says it all ... `` INDIAN SPICE RAVE \\'\\' .\\nMy GF and I dine at Bukhara often as she lives near it .\\nThe lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .\\nWe go often for lunch and the place is packed .\\nWe have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given .\\nBukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC .\\nWretched and retching .\\nThis will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life .\\nThey have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant .\\nI have never been so disgusted by both food an service .\\nFor starters they delivered us someone else \\'s order .\\nFine , I wont hang you for that .\\nHowever , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , -LRB- sometimes you have to settle when it \\'s your only option -RRB- , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .\\nNot one to jump to complaints -LRB- hence my lack of previous online reviewing -RRB- , I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .\\nMy main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .\\nNone was made so i hung up .\\nLess than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet .\\nMy girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .\\nNot only have I worked in restaurants for many years , I am now in culinary school , I am a huge lover of oysters and fish , and my girlfriend is half Korean !\\nWe know the difference between and oyster and bad fish .\\nIt was n\\'t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it \\'s simply repulsive .\\nEat at your own risk .\\nGorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner .\\nI took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night .\\nI book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .\\nThe service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing !\\nI completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date .\\nMore Williamsburg Garbage .\\nMy wife and I visited Dokebi tonight .\\nWe ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum .\\nThe dishes came out around 5 minutes apart .\\nThe bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n\\'t even close to sizzling .\\nToo bad I had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .\\nThe nakgi-bokum was horrible .\\nEasily the worst stir-fried squid I \\'ve ever tasted .\\nThe sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean .\\nThe side dishes were passable , and I did get a refill upon request .\\nThe real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service .\\nI mentioned the squid dish was n\\'t very good when the waitress visited .\\nShe just nodded and walked off .\\nThere were no communications issues either , as she spoke perfect English .\\nAs to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made .\\nMy wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .\\nWe were charged full price .\\nIf you ware looking for Korean fusion , I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village .\\nAuthentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street , of course .\\nLives up to the hype .\\nWe \\'ve lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there .\\nWe \\'ve tried before but it always packed and does n\\'t take reservations .\\nIt was well worth the wait .\\nThe wife had the risotto which was amazing .\\nIt does n\\'t look appetizing as it \\'s covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .\\nThe farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .\\ni love margherita pizza -- i looove east village pizza .\\nLove this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go .\\nA quintessential slice of NYC pizza .\\nThe crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .\\nPersonally I like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .\\nPossibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City .\\nThis is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie -LRB- that do n\\'t serve sushi -RRB- , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !\\nNot only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you \\'re no longer in the city .\\nIf you \\'re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you \\'ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching -LRB- choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! -RRB-\\nIt \\'s just you and your date and an occasional cute ` excuse me \\' before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth !\\nMy party had the BBE $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !\\nI never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it .\\nWe started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .\\nOur first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce .\\nI picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better .\\nThe entrees were served with miso soup and rice .\\nThe sake \\'s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .\\nFor desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse -LRB- interesting but not extraordinary -RRB- and matcha -LRB- powdered green tea -RRB- and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .\\nMaybe it was the great company -LRB- I had friends visiting from Philly -- yes , it was not a date this time -RRB- or the super reasonable price point , but I just ca n\\'t say enough good things about this brasserie .\\nI do n\\'t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but I \\'ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .\\nTerrible would be a compliment !\\nThe service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .\\nWe were 10 people celebrtating a birthday , we sat in the tent .\\nWe paid a fixed pricce but got nothing !!\\nWe never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .\\nThey are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !\\nStay away .\\nGreat Shabu Shabu .\\nI go here at least once every other week , particularly when it \\'s cold !\\nI love it .\\nTo be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu .\\nI tried a couple other dishes but was n\\'t too impressed .\\nBut for the Shabu Shabu , you wo n\\'t find much better in NY .\\nIn fact there is only one I \\'ve tried that even compares -LRB- shabu Tatsu -RRB- and even then I prefer Dokebi .\\nThe meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .\\nDokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .\\nThe hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .\\nRestaurant with a view .\\nCelebrated my fathers birthday here .\\nThe food tasted very good .\\nThe family seafood entree was very good .\\nThe main entree was also very good .\\nWe order a bit of everything on the menu .\\nPrice is high but the food is good , so I would come back again .\\nThis place does n\\'t make any sense .\\nJust want to warn you all - do n\\'t waste your time and money .\\nThis place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ... .\\nThis place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .\\nThe concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n\\'t work .\\nThe food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked .\\nGo to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place - this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake .\\nGood Food .\\nI went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary .\\nThe food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I do n\\'t like being cramp in a corner .\\nOver all it was a very nice romantic place .\\nI would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation -LRB- if possible -RRB- .\\nLoved it .\\nA coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it .\\nThe atmosphere was great .\\nThe food we ordered was excellent , although I would n\\'t say the margaritas were anything to write home about .\\nOur waitress was n\\'t mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .\\nI must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .\\nMaybe it has improved since then ?\\nRegardless , we \\'ll be back and ca n\\'t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .\\nDumbfoundingly Poor .\\nThis was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience .\\nLexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn .\\nThe servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .\\nPolite acknowledgement is out ; .\\nsupercilious scorn is in .\\nAnd how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?\\nA different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer -LRB- which was delicious -RRB- .\\nOverall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it has n\\'t sat cooling in front of the guest .\\nThe place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list -LRB- I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins -RRB- .\\nAt $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you \\'re looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture .\\nOn that scale , it \\'s a world-beater .\\nHow is this palce still open ?\\nI honestly do n\\'t even know where to begin .\\nMy boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms .\\nWe arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .\\nWe ordered our appetizers , I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .\\nEverything was going good until we got our meals .\\nI took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .\\nIt was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .\\nMy boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat .\\nI took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .\\nAt this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n\\'t say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .\\nSo , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .\\nI could n\\'t even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .\\nI \\'ve had better chicken at BBQs !!!!\\nSo I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .\\nGuess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier \\'\\' No apology , nothing .\\nAfter that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it !!!!!!!!!!!!\\nNo desert menu , no apology , nothing !!!!!!\\nI was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager .\\nThis is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it \\'s a matter of taste that she did n\\'t like it , and I can not comp it .\\nAgain , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing !!!!\\nWe refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore .\\nThe level of rudeness was preposterous .\\nThe manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .\\nI HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE .\\nTHIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .\\ncirspy crust margherita pizza .\\nwe have been there 3 times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes .\\nit was really good pizza .\\nthe crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded :-RRB- :-RRB- :-RRB- .\\nyou know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review .\\nSingle Worst Restaurant in Manhattan .\\nI \\'ll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .\\nMoving on .\\nIf I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place .\\nCasa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian .\\nThe reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .\\nWell ... they can run but they ca n\\'t hide .\\nI live in the West Village and I \\'ve been to a lot of restaurants .\\nSometimes you pay a lot and do n\\'t get much in return - it \\'s manhattan , things are expensive .\\nHowever , most of them are at least prompt and pleasant .\\nThis place ... god where do i begin .\\nIt is quite a spectacular scene i \\'ll give them that .\\nThe decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n\\'t notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME !!!!\\nHow this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy , or any other for that matter , is beyond me .\\nGreat Hot Dogs !\\nI \\'ve made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby -LRB- I live on UWS -RRB- .\\nThough it \\'s been crowded most times I \\'ve gone here , Bark always delivers on their food .\\nThe hot dogs are top notch , and they \\'re Slamwich is amazing !\\nGoing to Bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !\\nOnly complaint is the pricing -- I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .\\nBut nonetheless -- great spot , great food .\\nFabulous food - if the front of house staff do n\\'t put you off -- .\\nWe live nearby BFC .\\nIt \\'s a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we \\'ve eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .\\nEach time we \\'ve been , the front of house staff -LRB- not the waiters - they \\'re fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you -RRB- has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .\\nAs BFC does n\\'t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !\\nThe frizzy retro girl -LRB- with winged / Dame Edna glasses -RRB- will yell at you if you try to order a drink .\\nI was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she `` had a BBQ to go to \\'\\' that night - WTF ??\\nI \\'d be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !\\nThere \\'s another girl who I ca n\\'t describe , she is about 5 \\' 6 \\'\\' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you \\'re * really * talking about .\\nI \\'m a friendly person , so I would n\\'t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .\\nAgain , I \\'d be super upset if that were my employee .\\nConsidering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service .\\nSo , if you \\'re walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who \\'s going to be seating you first ... .\\nMaitre-D - `` Eat and get out \\'\\' .\\nMy family ate here last weekend .\\nThe food and service were fine , however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .\\nWhile finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son \\'s fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .\\nThis guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including Paris , that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .\\nHis response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .\\nA word to the wise : you ca n\\'t dine here and disturb the maitre-D \\'s sense of \\'\\' table turnover \\'\\' , as whacked as it is , or else .\\nIf you go here , do it on his off-night .\\nBest meal in a long time !\\nMussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening .\\nI had the Lamb special which was perfect .\\nMy father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish .\\nThe Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience .\\nThe food is great and the environment is even better .\\nEveryone must come here at least once .\\nHighly recommend it !\\nTaking Hot Dogs to the next level .\\nAt first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at Bark you do n\\'t just get your average hot dog .\\nHere the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .\\nGreat Atmosphere .\\nWent to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal .\\nI highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .\\nCool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .\\nPoor service and management .\\nDo n\\'t go to this place !\\nHad an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner .\\nAppetizers took nearly an hour .\\nWhen the main course finally arrived -LRB- another 45mins -RRB- half of our order was missing .\\nNever got an explanation as to what was going on .\\nThe manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .\\nWhen we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing .\\nOn the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .\\nCa n\\'t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .\\nWhat a hassle !\\nThe food is very good , but not outstanding .\\nThere is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .\\nOn our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .\\nMistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff .\\nWithout the wait or attitude , I would probably go back , but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and do n\\'t make me jump through hoops .\\nExpensive .\\nI went there after hearing how great it was .\\nWow .\\nThe bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .\\nThe pasta was well cooked , did n\\'t have enough sauce though or flavor .\\nI though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far .\\nSo rude !!!\\nI went with JWILS .\\nHer review is above .\\nI was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .\\nMy friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .\\nThe hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .\\nThe only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .\\nI asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane .\\nI was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , `` can I help you \\'\\' and `` how many are in your party . \\'\\'\\nWhat ?\\nThe three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .\\nWe did n\\'t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem .\\nShame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service .\\nbad staff .\\nI generally like this place .\\nThe food is good .\\nThe design of the space is good .\\nBut the service is HORRID !\\nI was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .\\nThe waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .\\nI ca n\\'t believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !\\nThe waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating -LRB- a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it -RRB- .\\nI could n\\'t ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .\\nShe then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .\\nI wish I could like this place more , and I wish someone would retrain the staff .\\nYum !\\nServes really good sushi .\\nNot the biggest portions but adequate .\\nGreen Tea creme brulee is a must !\\nDo n\\'t leave the restaurant without it .\\nNo Comparison .\\n-- I ca n\\'t say enough about this place .\\nIt has great sushi and even better service .\\nThe entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need .\\nI \\'ve been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date .\\nSnotty Attitude .\\n-- We were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast .\\nThe owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint .\\nGood food !\\n-- We love breakfast food .\\nThis is a great place to get a delicious meal .\\nWe never had to wait more than 5 minutes .\\nThe staff is pretty friendly .\\nThe onion rings are great !\\nThey are not greasy or anything .\\nOverrated .\\n-- I was highly disappointed in the food at Pagoda .\\nThe lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns , the few they actually give you ... were not good .\\nThe prices are outrageous , especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood Chinese establishments .\\nNice ambience , but highly overrated place .\\nI will not go back .\\nWorst Service I Ever Had .\\n-- A group of 5 of us went there for Sunday brunch and sat outside .\\nEveryone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received .\\nOur waiter was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered , we were not given any water or utensils .\\nI complained to the manager , but he was not even apologetic .\\nI will never return again .\\nFabulous Italian Food !\\n-- I highly recommend Mioposto .\\nI am so happy to have a wonderful Italian restaurant in my neighborhood .\\nThe wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to Italy .\\nI love this restaurant .\\n-- I will never forget the amazing meal , service , and ambiance I experience at this restaurant .\\nIt was absolutely amazing .\\nThe wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse , the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice , good at their jobs and cultured .\\nI have not a bad thing to say about this place .\\nAMAZING .\\nI can not wait to go back again this coming weekend !\\nMmm ... good !\\n-- Went there last night with a friend .\\nShe had heard from a co-worker about this place .\\nThe food was great !\\nIt \\'s * very * reasonably priced , esp for the quality of the food .\\nI had the Kafta plate and it was perfect .\\nWe \\'re going back :D .\\nFinally a meal that you will remember for a long time !\\n-- In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants , its nice to see a place that bucks that trend , and just plain delivers high quality food and good service , period .\\nThis is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer .\\nCaution - its real food for people who love the best .\\nSome of the food is clearly oriented toward foodies -LRB- like me -RRB- so if your not a foodie -LRB- nothing wrong with that -RRB- - head over to McDonalds or some Ruby Tuesday and have at it !\\nIf your looking for real quality -LRB- not the BS that is seen on yelp ratings - which allegedly recently got in trouble for `` adjusting \\'\\' ratings -RRB- , you need to get in here !\\nVery Disappointing .\\n-- I took my parents here for their anniversary-very very disappointed !!!\\nI liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price .\\nI may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it .\\nRice is too dry , tuna was n\\'t so fresh either .\\nNothing really came across as outstanding .\\nVery disappointed .\\nI have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent .\\nHowever , the value and service are both severely lacking .\\nPortions contain less fish than one would expect , particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in NYC -LRB- Masa excluded , of course -RRB- .\\nFurthermore , while the fish is unquestionably fresh , rolls tend to be inexplicably bland .\\nThe service ranges from mediocre to offensive .\\nOn a recent trip , our waiter was extremely dismissive , while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby .\\nWe were then charged for their most expensive sake -LRB- $ 20 + per serving -RRB- when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price .\\nBut Im sure this was just an honest mistake ... .\\nFreshest sushi -- I love this restaurant .\\nThey pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls .\\nThe sashimi was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted .\\nTheir apps are all delicious .\\nThe only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side .\\nBut the space is small and lovely , and the service is helpful .\\nYou are bound to have a very charming time .\\nNot recommanded !!!\\n-- The food was not great & the waiters were rude .\\nIt is not worth going at all and spend your money there !!!\\ngreat service .\\n-- Pretty cheap for sit down Mexican AND downtown .\\nmy service was stellar !\\nthe bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me .\\nfood was fine , with a some little-tastier-than-normal salsa .\\nIf you \\'re in the area you should n\\'t be disappointed .\\nOk ... -- Maybe I went in on someone \\'s bad day ... .\\nthe food was great , the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me .\\nTook forever to get our order taken , water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention .\\nI do n\\'t know if I \\'ll be back ... .\\nMama Mia -- I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place .\\nthe only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it \\'s edible , even when you order ahead .\\nBUt once done , it \\'s not too much dough , not too much cheese , not too much sauce .\\nBest Sushi in town .\\nHave gone to all the top places .\\nEverything you want and more , very fresh .\\nIts worth the wait , especially since they \\'ll give you a call when the table is ready .\\nThe best calamari in Seattle !\\n-- ... and the best summertime deck experience -- they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather .\\nA perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year .\\nEndless fun , awesome music , great staff !!!\\n-- By far the best bar in the east village ... .\\nI went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast !\\nEvery time `` 0-sixtynine \\'\\' is called the bartender buys everyone drinks !\\nBeen there lots since and its always a good time .\\nGreat draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks .\\nDefinitely has one of the best jukebox \\'s i \\'ve seen in a long long time .\\nI FOUND A NEW HOME ON SECOND AVENUE !!!!!!!!!!!!\\n-- Where can I begin .\\nI ca n\\'t !!!\\nJust go there and see for yourself .\\nThe food is great , the bartenders go that extra mile .\\nYou need to watch your game , they will have it on for you .\\nThe owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for .\\nAnd the upstairs is a great place to hang out .\\nNot alot of smoking places left in New York , but I have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city .\\nKudos to these guys .\\nI found a new home and just moved with a long lease .\\nThank you .\\nGo Beyond the California Rolls ... .\\nThe sushi here is delicious !\\nThey have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from ; Atlantic or Pacific .\\nI \\'ve had the Jellyfish , Horse Mackerel , Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others , and they were all good .\\nMy only negative comment is that I wish the pieces were a little bigger .\\nThe decor is rustic , traditional Japanese .\\nThe crowd is mixed yuppies , young and old .\\nThe service was courteous and attentive .\\nMediocre food .\\n-- We ate on the outside patio area for dinner on a Saturday night .\\nThe outside patio area has an abbreviated menu .\\nWe ordered the marinated grapes , buffalo style chicken wings , and the turkey sandwich .\\nMy g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price .\\nWe are locals , and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists .\\nService was decent .\\nDrinks were good .\\nUnless you are just stopping in for a few drinks I would n\\'t recommend going here .\\nYou are likely to be disappointed .\\nExcellent food , nice ambience , fairly expensive .\\n-- I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi -LRB- 5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis -RRB- and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes .\\nThe ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney .\\nIt was romantic - and even nice even with my sister , reminded me of Italy , and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa .\\nI recommend it for a night when you want to splurge -LRB- it was a bit expensive -RRB- !\\nBest Indian food in L.A. .\\n-- I \\'ve been to over a dozen Indian places in L.A. , and this is still my favorite .\\nThe best thing is , the prices are also quite reasonable .\\nThe chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes .\\nThe chana masala -LRB- garbanzo beans -RRB- are also excellent .\\nIt \\'s located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center , not the greatest location , but the food keeps me coming back for more .\\nhidden little jem .\\n-- tucked away over by the Beverly Center .\\nNever too crowded and always great service .\\nI think I have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent .\\nI can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma .\\nYou routinely see Indian families and friends dining there , which is always a good sign .\\nI appreciate their delivery too .\\nNice food but no spice !\\n-- I really enjoyed my meal here .\\nI had yummy lamb korma , saag paneer , samosas , naan , etc. .\\nThe food was all good but it was way too mild .\\nNormally , places ask how hot you want it , but they did n\\'t .\\nI should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild .\\nI will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches .\\nThe naan was some of the best I \\'ve had and I really enjoyed the bhartha , not too tomatoey .\\nEven the chickpeas , which I normally find too dry , were good .\\nAnd they packaged everything nicely so it did n\\'t spill .\\nawesome find .\\n-- I do n\\'t understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long ... the fajita salad , the colorado , the fajitas - EVERYTHING is delicious .\\nI love the warm & cosy environment .\\nI just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party - ca n\\'t wait to celebrate my next birthday there .\\nbest restaurant in the world , great decor , great customer service , friendly manager .\\n-- first of all henrymillionare you dont know a thing about middle eastern food so dont talk .\\nCry me a river , stop complaining you obviously you have no taste in food .\\ni am never disappointed with there food .\\nthe atmosphere is great .\\nand all you other people that have a problem get some help .\\ngreat lunch spot .\\n-- Great financial district mexican spot .\\nAlways busy , but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service .\\nEverything I \\'ve had here is good , taco salads , burritos , enchiladas i love this place .\\nAlso have great margaritas !\\nYou can order to go if you have to get back to the office too !\\nLebanese Food , Yum !\\n-- I \\'ve been to Open Sesame only once , but I \\'m still reeling from the experience !!\\nThe food is simply unforgettable !\\nI had the beef kabobs with a side of cucumber yogurt .\\nThe presentation of the food was an added bonus , it looked just as great as it tasted !\\nMy best friend had the chicken shawarma and she STILL raves about it being the best anywhere !\\nHer sister had the baklava for dessert !\\nWhat a tastly , flaky treat !\\nThe staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful .\\nGO TO OPEN SESAME !!!\\nHoly Hummus !\\n-- The food is here is incredible , though the quality is inconsistent during lunch .\\nDinners have always been excellent , in terms of food quality .\\nThe open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given .\\nThe side of potatoes is to die for , as is the labne -LRB- yogurt dip -RRB- .\\nAlso , they serve THE best hummus in America , with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil -LRB- which , I believe is the traditional way -RRB- !\\nThe only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service .\\nThere have been several occasions when we \\'ve just not gotten some side dishes we \\'ve ordered .\\nHowever , this place is a gem , and I wo n\\'t stop going back .\\ngreat beer .\\n-- My first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible !\\nWe waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1\\xa01/2 hours for our food .\\nI swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal .\\nHOWEVER , one Sunday afternoon my husband and I did go -LRB- although with my loud protests -RRB- and were pleasantly surprised .\\nThe band was very good and the service was attentive .\\nOutside in the area between the restaurant and the park , children were running around while their parents sipped wine .\\nWe ordered a selection of the small plates , and the shoe string onions , goat cheese pizza , grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good .\\nIt was like dining at a completely different restaurant .\\nWe have since returned and also had a great experience , sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer -LRB- cold and good -RRB- .\\nWe did have the same waiter the second time , so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good .\\nSunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun .\\nSeattle \\'s BEST Winelist .\\n-- Ray \\'s -LRB- suprisingly -RRB- has the city \\'s BEST & most diverse wine list .\\nThe sommelier is fantastic , down-to-earth , & extremely knowlegable .\\nI would go back for the wine experience alone .\\nNice job !\\nNOT THE PLACE IT ONCE WAS .\\n-- It is sad to see a place that was once `` THE \\'\\' place to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch , now be the place that is a big `` DONT BOTHER . \\'\\'\\nThe food is not what it once was -LRB- potions have seriously seen downsizing -RRB- prices have gone up , and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere -LRB- including mainland Europe -RRB- .\\nWhat may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment .\\nThis establishment really made a marked decline after -LRB- and this is recurring story -RRB- the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS `` DINERS , DRIVE-INS , AND DIVES \\'\\' hosted by Guy Fieri , in which Schooner or Later was subject of .\\nPerhaps now , Scooner or Later falls into the `` Dive \\'\\' category .\\nThis is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat .\\nI hope one day Scooner or Later returns to what it once was .\\nUntill this happens , my advice is to STAY AWAY .\\nOpen & Cool Place with the Best Pizza and Coffee .\\n-- Mioposto has a very creative & delicious pizza menu .\\nThe coffe is very good , too .\\nGreat open and friendly ambience .\\nThis place is charming and relaxing .\\nThe servers behind the counter are always friendly and helpful .\\nIt reminds me of those great little restaurants in San Francisco .\\nIt \\'s a great place to enjoy food and meet friends .\\nOld Reliable .\\n-- After 12 years in Seattle Ray \\'s rates as the place we always go back to .\\nGreat food , spectacular location , and friendly service keep us coming back year after year .\\nEnjoyed the food .\\n-- First of all , I am not from Long Beach .\\nI was visiting SoCal a couple of months ago when the friend I was visiting decided to take me to this restaurant .\\n-LRB- She was actually going to take me to another mediterranean restaurant right across the street but they were not open yet even though it was a few minutes past their opening time . -RRB-\\nI liked it .\\nFood was good and cheap .\\nI had the kafta plate and I enjoyed it .\\nIt was so much though that I could barely finish but I did , since it was delicious .\\nAtmosphere was nice .\\nService was kind of slow , our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it was n\\'t that busy .\\nStill I would recommend this place .\\nBTW , I really like Long Beach .\\nIt was one of the few places in SoCal where you would actually walk around and not have to take a car .\\nWOW !!!!!!!!\\n-- IT CANT GET ANY BETTER !!!!!\\nWHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY NICE PEOPLE AMAZING FOOD WOW .\\nGreat food with an awesome atmosphere !\\n-- Eggs , pancakes , potatoes , fresh fruit and yogurt -- everything they serve is delicious .\\nThe best place for a leisure Sunday breakfast amidst yachts , then take a stroll through the nearby Farmer \\'s Market .\\ngreat meal -- the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent -- there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi -- this fish was perfect !!!!\\nplus , i am allergic to rice , and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating -- did n\\'t even bat an eye !\\nand the waiter suggested a perfect sake !!\\nabsolutely fabulous !!!\\nUnbeatable sushi !\\nTwo thumbs up !\\nI love sushi , and I have eaten it all over the world .\\nThis is right up there with places in Tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned .\\nMelt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi , and very tasty rolls too .\\nBe sure to try the oyster roll .\\nsplendid .\\n-- How to describe the best sushi in NYC : hmmmm , delicious , amazing , fantastic , suculent , perfect , nah , all of the above .\\nI ca n\\'t saybenough good things about this restaurant , and I ca n\\'t wait for my next several visits .\\nThe best Chuwam Mushi I have ever had .\\nPerfect on a cold day .\\n$ 6 with tip .\\nPerfection .\\nGood Sushi , High Price .\\nOne of the best Sushi place in town .\\nThe house special roll is really good .\\nOn weekends , you might have to wait for couple hours .\\nHowever , they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone .\\nA cozy spot for 2 .\\n-- I ca n\\'t believe Murphy \\'s has been around for over 25 years , amazing .\\nThat \\'s a huge compliment , especially in the fickled restaurant business , ... enough already !\\nBrunch at Murphy \\'s is to die for , my specialty ... egg white omelet , the food is always freshly prepared .\\nIt \\'s the perfect spot for a romantic date for 2 or a secret rendezvous !\\nSave room for scrumptious desserts .\\nThe restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you wo n\\'t forget !\\nI guarantee you wo n\\'t be disappointed , there \\'s also valet parking .\\nAddicting !\\n-- Best Mexican place for lunch in the financial district .\\nLove the enchiladas and chicken soup - and be sure to check out their specials .\\nThe cooks have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes .\\nCan get busy on Fridays for a table but once seated , the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly .\\nI went there with a friend from out of town ... and we were both very impressed !\\nWent on a Monday night , so there was no wait for a table .\\nThe sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick .\\nThe price was right too .\\nThe atmosphere was just okay .\\nSpace was limited , but the food made up for it .\\nI \\'d go back there in a heartbeat .\\nShould have gone to Trader Joe \\'s and had frozen pizza :-LRB- .\\n-- My family went on a midweek evening to have dinner .\\nThe restaurant was 80 % full and there was a sign posted `` wait to be seated . \\'\\'\\nWell I guess it \\'s hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff .\\nWe stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us .\\nFinally , my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked , `` Are you waiting for a table ? \\'\\'\\nOnce seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal .\\nThe prior reviews said Kid friendly ... give me a break with two young children that is light years .\\nThe Caesar salad I ordered had so much lemon I could n\\'t eat it .\\nThe pizza was slightly reminescent of Baker \\'s Beach pizza which occupied the the space years ago -LRB- a distant second -RRB- .\\nIt was decent but nothing exceptional .\\nThis establishment is consistent with my feelings of the rest of Chow Foods group .\\nWe used to frequent most of their restaurants but over the years each one has really been disapointing .\\nI \\'m a born and bred Southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening .\\nWell , I guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management to pay a visit to Tutta Bella in Columbia City for some tips .\\nGreat food , better Margaritas !\\n-- This is one of my top lunch spots , huge portions , fast service and amazing margaritas !!\\nit gets really busy , so get there on the early side so you can grab a seat , if you do have to wait , its not bad because the service is quick !\\nCheck out the art on the walls , very colorful !\\ni love this place !\\n-- i have been eating at this place for over 8 years now and i have never had one bad meal .\\ni highly recommend this place to all that want to try indain food for the first time .\\nThe lunch menu is an awesome deal !\\nplenty of food , trust me .\\nFresh ingrediants and super tasty .\\nThe place is the next best thing to my Moms cooking .\\nBest food , phenominal service .\\nFor the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best NYC has to offer , the fish is the freshest and the service is superb .\\nNot only can the selection be innovative , but there \\'s a nice balance of traditional sushi as well .\\nThe nicest waiters in town .\\nWAY OVER-RATED !!!!\\n-- This place is unbelievably over-rated .\\nIf I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average brunch food , then I would put Murphy \\'s at the top of the list .\\nThe regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive .\\n10 !\\nYour a sushi fan , you love expertly cut fish , great sake , a killer SOHO location , and of course : Salmon , Tuna , Fluke , Yellow Tail , Cod , Mackeral , Jellyfish , Sea Urchin , Shrimp , Lobster , Sea Bream , Trout , Milk Fish , Blue Fin Tuna , Eel , Crab , Sardine , Monk Fish , Roe , Scallop , Oysters , and a varity of Toro .\\nThere is only one place on the east coast that has it all , plus a lot more .\\nBetter than nobu , tomoe , taka , yama , sugiyama , and the rest .\\nBring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world : BLUE RIBBON SUSHI .\\nBelieve it baby !\\nCut to the chase - this is amazing !\\nIt \\'s unpretentious and underground .\\nIt \\'s fresh , welcoming , delicious , and relaxing .\\nHands down , the best tuna I have ever had .\\nBlue Ribbon lives up to it \\'s fantastic reputation .\\nI went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again .\\nWhat a find !\\nWell worth it .\\nGreat value sushi with high quality & nice setting .\\nGood for late night dining -LRB- last minute planning -RRB- without reservations .\\nTry the Chef \\'s Choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty .\\nPoor customer service / poor pizza .\\n-- As with most restaurants in Seattle , Mioposto \\'s service was bad and the food was overpriced .\\nI know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places , but Mioposto \\'s pizza lacks quality and good taste .\\nTo be honest , I \\'ve had better frozen pizza .\\nI \\'m not kidding .\\nThe only positive thing about Mioposto is the nice location .\\nLove it every time .\\nI was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews - this place is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way , and we \\'ve eaten here more than 10 times .\\nPeople complain about the dim lighting , but that is one what I love about this place - if you want to stare at your food in bright light , go to McDonalds .\\nThe food is fantastic , and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we \\'ve been there .\\nThe only problem would be the wait , but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting .\\nNever had one single problem there .\\nSeafood Plus .\\n-- This was great dining experience .\\nIf you \\'re going to see Danny Gans or just staying at the Mirage , do n\\'t miss this one .\\nThe appetizer of oysters , lobster , crab -LRB- small size -RRB- made a perfect entre for my wife .\\nSeabass on lobster risotto was the best .\\nCaesar salad was superb .\\nGreat bottle of wine .\\nLeave room for dessert .\\nCOMPLETELY OVER RATED !\\nI will have to do more research before checking out new places based on Diners , drive-ins and dives reviews .\\nI noice most reviews mention the bad service .\\nThe food was ok , but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served .\\nEven then , the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items .\\nWe had a very hard time getting the waitress \\' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .\\nAs it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 % discount on our bill .\\nWhen the bill came , he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks .\\nIt was clear he did n\\'t really care .\\nWith so many great breakfast/lunch places in So Cal , this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit .\\nAVOID THE PLACE .\\n-- Save yourself the waste of time & DO NOT visit .\\nI made my 1st trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online .\\nWhen I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible !\\nI waited for 10-15 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again .\\nAfter sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes I left .\\nI went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that does n\\'t work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link .\\nI never heard back from anyone more than a month ago .\\nAfter telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar .\\nAfter sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she \\'d be right with us .\\nWe left without ever getting service .\\nAs of writing this I just tried their give away a link again & it still does n\\'t work .\\nThere are so many better places to visit !\\nBest Crab Cakes in Town .\\n-- Thats a big statement considering I \\'ve been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since I was about seven - but something about these little devils gets better every time .\\nIf you can , come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening .\\nGreat seasonal fish and seafood , with a classy waterfront setting .\\nAlways a winner .\\nGreat Pizza , Poor Service .\\n-- Love their pizza , especially the mushroom pizza .\\nAlso love their caeser salad .\\nPrefer to order it and pick it up though because I do n\\'t like the servers , one young woman in particular .\\nShe does n\\'t make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance .\\nBut she is very friendly with certain people , making it even more annoying .\\nManagement should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners .\\nMany people talk about the great pizza and poor service , so it ca n\\'t just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers .\\nIt \\'s a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n\\'t so impersonal and corporate-like .\\nGreat Breakfast .\\n-- This place is famous for their breakfast .\\nThey have been featured on the food network and they deserve it .\\nThe food is great and they make a mean bloody mary .\\nI love breakfast here .\\nTheir crab eggs benedict is addicting .\\nAll their menu items are a hit , and they serve mimosas .\\nDoes n\\'t get any better than that .\\nbest chinese food i have tasted in a long time .\\n-- we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night .\\nthere was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area .\\nYou can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing .\\nthe ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning .\\nnot too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up .\\nthe staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese .\\nwe ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food .\\nFirst off , the food came fast and all together :-RRB- i like that ... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other .\\nso about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty .\\nyummy .\\nbest honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted .\\nnext one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli .\\nthe brocollis were so fresh and tasty .\\ni would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time , every piece was as eventful as the first one ... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked .\\nnot chewy at all .\\nfor desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee ... oh la la yummy !!!\\nmelt in your mouth .\\nwe are for sure coming back to this restaurant .\\nevery month if possible .\\nit is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel ... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss , esp if your in downtown san jose .\\nChintzy portions .\\n-- The sushi here is perfectly good , but for $ 5 a piece , either the slices of fish should be larger , or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant -LRB- even for NYC -RRB- .\\nWe easily spent more than $ 40 per person -LRB- not including alcohol -RRB- and were still hungry .\\nI \\'m astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ .\\nTerrible service , food ok , pricey .\\n-- This past weekend had great weather for San Francisco standards .\\nSo for the ` after beach excursion \\' , we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to Park Chalet .\\nThe restaurant was busy , however there were a few tables open .\\nWe put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it \\'d be a 30 minute wait .\\nSo here we are , my wife , 3 year old daughter and I trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building -LRB- where the murals and artifacts are -RRB- .\\n30 minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off .\\nWe went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago !!\\nLogic behind that ?\\nNone that I can think of .\\nWe put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n\\'t arrive until 45 minutes later ... WITH OUR MAIN COURSE .\\nUm so now what are appetizers for ???\\nOh I forgot to mention that they do n\\'t have bread service .\\nIts a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag .\\nMy wife also ordered a teapot of hot water -LRB- she had a sore throat -RRB- and I guess that since it was only water , it was n\\'t a priority for them to actually bring it .\\nIn other words , if they are n\\'t making $ $ off of you then you do n\\'t rate high on their ` service scale \\' .\\nFood wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n\\'t a fancy place .\\nThe upside of the restaurant ?\\nIf I needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or Golden Gate park .\\nIts great if you spent the day there and did n\\'t want to drive to eat .\\nParking is reasonably good , they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby .\\nAnother plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides .\\nI \\'d hate for tourists to go to Park Chalet and think that this is how all San Francisco restaurants are like .\\nAlways good .\\n-- A sushi-fiend friend recently visited and our group of three just had to come for dinner .\\n6pm on a Sat before a Broadway play and we were quickly seated and served .\\nAmazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi -LRB- that eel with avodcao -- um um um -RRB- .\\nAs usual the omikase did n\\'t disappoint in freshness , although it scored low on creativity and selection .\\nTheir specialty rolls are impressive , though I ca n\\'t remember what we had .\\nGreat selection of sakes .\\nGreen tea creme brulee gets better each time I have it .\\nIt is n\\'t the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time .\\nVery poor customer service .\\n-- Schooner or Later \\'s charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not , unfortunately , compensate for its very poor customer service .\\nWhile this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service .\\nAs part of a small party of four , our food was dropped off without comment ; .\\nany further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table .\\nWhen we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order .\\nAfter one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant .\\nA brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment -- to say we had been `` blown off \\'\\' would be an understatement .\\nThe manager continually interrupted with `` Is there anything else I can do for you \\'\\' , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .\\nShe promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n\\'t bothered to get the waitresses name .\\nIn short , Schooner or Later could n\\'t have cared less about our being at their establishment .\\nNext time we will go somewhere else , or try other restaurants close by like Mimi \\'s Cafe and Claim Jumper .\\n1 o\\'clock in the morning .\\nyou are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi ... then this might be the place .\\nthe fish was fresh , though it was cut very thin .\\ngreat service .\\ngood sake selection .\\nDungeness crabs here !\\n-- Ray \\'s is THE place to go for high quality seafood dinners .\\nAnd they give good quantity for the price .\\nWe were only in Seattle for one night and I \\'m so glad we picked Rays for dinner !\\nI love Dungeness crabs and at Ray \\'s you can get them served in about 6 different ways !\\nWe shared the family platter and I especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu .\\nI ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting ... yummy !\\nAnd the service was simply spendid - quite a delight .\\nGreat Breakfast .\\n-- Great drinks , corn beef hash , coffee , B Fast burritos , Gluten Free menu .\\nThe service is fantastic at this fun place .\\nIf there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a place is open , you know it is great .\\nThis is the case at this gem .\\nBest Neighborhood Standby .\\nYou Ca n\\'t Go Wrong Here .\\n-- Every neighborhood has a few great local bars that are the best secrets .\\nIn Grammercy/Union Square/East Village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot .\\nThe music is great , no night better or worse , the bar tenders are generous with the pouring , and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits .\\nSeriously , you ca n\\'t go wrong , if it is unpretentious local fun you seek .\\nOh , and the cheese fries are awesome !\\nGood Food , Great Service , Average Prices -LRB- For the Strip -RRB- .\\n-- I decided to eat at Stack because of their price fixed pre-show dinner .\\nWhen I walked in , I was taken aback by their incredible wood decor .\\nThe music playing was very hip , 20-30 something pop music , but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat , which became annoying midway through dinner .\\nWe were quickly seated and requested the special dinner , which came with : 1 -RRB- Shellfish and Shrimp appetizer or Caesar Salad , 2 -RRB- 9 oz steak -LRB- with a single potato chip -RRB- , and 3 -RRB- homemade donut holes .\\nI got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright .\\nIt was n\\'t the freshest seafood ever , but the taste and presentation was OK .\\nBefore the steak came , the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested I pick something from the menu .\\nI picked the asparagus , which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared .\\nIt was steamed and tossed with garlic .\\nThe 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great , at least initially .\\nThe steak was done to my exact liking -LRB- medium rare -RRB- and was nice and juicy .\\nIt?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste .\\nThough , one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak .\\nMy mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ... MSG ... taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant .\\nFinally , the homemade donut holes were served for desert .\\nThey came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and not-too-sweet .\\nThe desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner .\\nThe dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip , almost $ 50/pp after tax and tip -LRB- about average -RRB- .\\nBut the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly .\\nOverall , I would go back and eat at the restaurant again .\\nJust remember to dress a little urban-chic so you don?t look too far out of place .\\ngood sake , good food -- i honestly do n\\'t know much about japanese food at all .\\nIn the past sake usuallly just tasted kind of like salty water to me .\\nServer made several sake suggestions which were very good .\\nhad many dishes but the BEST was the lobster 3 ways .\\nVERY GOOD !\\nOverpriced .\\n-- We dined at the Colorado location today .\\nWaited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd .\\nThe waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded .\\nAlso , there was only one bathroom stall - probably need more for such big crowds .\\nMost importantly , we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu .\\nAt best , the food was good and definately overpriced .\\nFor the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower .\\nNot sure if I would go back .\\nMy favortie pizza joint in Seattle .\\n-- This is my `` must bring out of town guests to \\'\\' restaurant and they always enjoy and rave about it .\\nIn fact , many want to return a second time during their visit .\\nThe pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic .\\nI \\'ve always found the wait staff and , if you sit at the bar , the cooks very friendly .\\nThey are n\\'t the most talkative , but everytime I \\'ve been there they have been very busy , which probably accounts for the lack of conversation .\\nI also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant .\\nIt \\'s just the right size for the menu .\\nExcellent .\\n-- My husband and I love eating at Mioposto Café .\\nWe \\'re ca n\\'t say enough about their delicious gourmet pizza \\'s !\\nYou wo n\\'t be disappointed by their menu .\\nThe pizza \\'s are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings .\\nYou never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there .\\nThe pizza \\'s are light and scrumptious .\\nTry the Pizza Ensalata !\\nIt \\'s a salad on top of pizza crust .\\nAbsolutely delicious .\\nThe pizza \\'s are not huge and the crust is thin ... keep that in mind when you \\'re ordering .\\nWorth the wait .\\n-- Had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning , but it was so worth it .\\nThe food is sinful .\\nThe staff was really friendly .\\nThe atmosphere was great .\\nThe specialty here is decadent pancakes , but I \\'ve been back now four times , and I \\'ve been wowed every time .\\nNothing on the menu is less than amazing .\\nGo with some friends , wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe , and enjoy more than your average breakfast .\\nGood eats .\\nWhose writing all the great reviews ?\\nWhy is it that -LRB- almost -RRB- every good review is by `` anonymous ? \\'\\'\\nI do n\\'t know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place .\\nI have been to this place , folks and it is BAD .\\nMaybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that \\'s half-way decent .\\nI have been here , spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment .\\nFancy pieces of exotic fish on a $ 100 dollar plate and NOT ONE was eatable .\\nDONOT GO !\\nDelicious .\\n-- The atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate .\\nThe best dish are the honwy walnut prawns - just outstanding .\\nThe service is really attentive and charming .\\n4 Locations .\\n-- they have 4 locations .\\nthe 2 listed and then one in Southglenn mall parking lot which is reviewed here and one in Ft Collins .\\nWe waited for an hour to be seated .\\nThe service was excellent , the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding .\\nIt was worth the wait .\\nPlan on waiting 30-70 minutes .\\nWill definitely be back .\\nSouthglenn is largest location .\\nDelicious ... !\\n-- I recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful restaurant on 2nd street and wow what a great evening we had .\\nThe food is fantastic , authentic , delicious and very , very affordable .\\nThe decor was beautiful and unique .\\nThere was a really nice vibe about the place ... good music , atmosphere and happy looking people .\\nOur server was very professional and friendly .\\nTo the owners of Open Sesame ... Bravo ... I ca n\\'t wait to come back to dine at your restaurant !\\nDelectable .\\nIt \\'s a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend -LRB- Thurs?Sun -RRB- you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar .\\nOnce you \\'re inside , the real experience begins .\\nEverything , and I mean everything on the menu is delectable .\\nThe waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .\\nThe sushi is as fresh as it comes?you \\'d think ocean was in their backyard , no joke !\\nIf you \\'re interested in good tasting -LRB- without the fish taste or smell -RRB- , large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place ... .\\nbig thick pepperoni .\\n-- The pepperoni \\'s cut real thick -- Yum .\\nThe pizza itself is not exactly the best I \\'ve had EVER , but still pretty good .\\nI probably would n\\'t go back though ` cuz I do n\\'t know if it \\'s worth it .\\nMaybe I \\'ll go back once more many years from now when I \\'ve forgotten I went there already .\\nSit in the Balcony .\\n-- Not bad .\\nFood was good and appetizing .\\nPortions was just enough for me , but may not be for a big eater .\\nFair menu selection .\\nThe appetizer was interesting , but the Creme Brulee was very savory and delicious .\\nIndoor ambience was modern .\\nIf it \\'s nice outside , request for a table in the balcony .\\nIt \\'s a great place to people watch .\\nAlthough the service could be improved considering the money you put in .\\nOur drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times .\\nShould check-up on us more frequently , do n\\'t you think ?\\nLate night dinning with exeptional food .\\n-- I did n\\'t want to go there because of the reviews and prices I saw on the internet .\\nThat was the last night in Vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing - so we walked in the check the place .\\nWe were seated right away , the table was private and nice .\\nThe service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters .\\nThe food was very good , filet mignon was probably the best I \\'ve ever try .\\nThe portions are big though , so do not order too much .\\nGroovy music made the dinner casual .\\nThe most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places .\\nI have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd .\\nThe bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .\\nThere were 3 bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink .\\nI felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom .\\nThis place rocks !!\\n-- Mercedes restaurant is so tasty , the service is undeniably awesome !\\nThe chips and salsa are so yummy , and the prices are fabulous .\\nThe atmosphere is aspiring , and the decor is festive and amazing .\\nThe catering is out of this world , and Raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world !!!\\nDrinks are suberb , and I feel like I am in a Third World country when I walk in the door .\\nInsultingly Overpriced .\\n- Mediocre Service/Quality .\\n-- This review is for the Southglen location which is not listed in Citysearch : I wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but Snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service , so this review as well as the other negative ones for their Larimer location will go unaddressed .\\nThe presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu .\\nTo start off , approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 .\\nThey serve it in a tall , skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .\\nI should have just asked for the check when I saw that ; but their menu was so unique that I continued .\\nThe pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 \\'\\' pancakes -LRB- one of them was more like 5 \\'\\' -RRB- in the pancake flight -LRB- sample of 3 different pancakes -RRB- is well over-priced .\\nThe pancakes should be larger -LRB- at least 8 \\'\\' -RRB- to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .\\nThe flavors were good but I have had far better pancakes at a German pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger .\\nOn my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if I had n\\'t rejected the meal all together .\\nI rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue .\\nTo their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .\\nIn the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea -LRB- I had water -RRB- .\\nThis was 2 times what the same meal would have cost at Le Peep .\\nSnooze provided an inventive pancake offering , but Le Peep would have provided better service and quality .\\nMuch more than just a great view !\\n-- I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray \\'s Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations .\\nRay \\'s is something of a Seattle institution , but given its gorgeous Sound views , I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .\\nImagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray \\'s !\\nTo start things off , our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .\\nMy party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , Ray \\'s fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .\\nFor my entr&eacute;e , I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano .\\nThe scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique -LRB- not to mention tasty -RRB- .\\nMy friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .\\nI had a taste of all three items on her plate , and they were superb .\\nOur server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but I did remain puzzled by one issue : Who thinks that Ray \\'s is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?\\nTwo rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner ... they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table .\\nGiven that Ray \\'s is a seafood restaurant ... well , you get the idea ... .\\nAll considered , I have to say that Ray \\'s Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution .\\nWhile I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .\\nOh yeah ... the view was good , too .\\nThis computer is absolutely AMAZING!!!\\n10 plus hours of battery...\\nsuper fast processor and really nice graphics card..\\nand plenty of storage with 250 gb(though I will upgrade this and the ram..)\\nThis computer is really fast and I\\'m shocked as to how easy it is to get used to...\\nI\\'ve only had mine a day but I\\'m already used to it...\\nGET

this computer make me (shockingly) want to do homework more;\\nwithout a big ol\\' clunky machine in my backpack, I feel like I can do programming homework anywhere.\\nI highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college.\\nA great feature is the spotlight search: one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword, rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document.\\nOh my goodness-I am not a happy camper.\\nMy HP is very heavy.\\nNot easy to carry.\\nThe battery has never worked well.\\nThe battery gets so HOT it is scary.\\nYet, HP won\\'t do anything about the problem.\\nI returned the computer to HP and they kept it for 3 months.\\nWhen I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of

care a bunch.\\nBut, at the same time they (the company) would not and could not do anything about my problem.\\nI would \\xa0say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful.\\nAnd, if you are going to deal with HP be careful.\\nIn my house, HP is a nasty word.\\nSince I purchased my Toshiba netbook, I have been very pleased with it, I have a laptob and a desktop.\\nThe netbook is easier

durable.\\nThe LED backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more.\\nI\\'m learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages.\\nA key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect.\\nThey have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I\\'m looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular.\\nI\\'m excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same.\\nIt\\'s more expensive but well worth it in the long run.\\nGreat product, very easy to use and great graphics.\\nOne drawback, I wish the keys were backlit.\\nI\\'m glad I bought this laptop, it was worth the few ($100) extra dollars.\\nIt had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted

sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later.\\nIf this is an improvement

nice day and hung up!\\nI can guarantee this will be the last Dell I will ever purchase!\\nBreaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4+ people to report the damaged part will be returned

product with great value.\\nIts ease of use and the top service from Apple- be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar- cannot be beat.\\nSuffice it to say, my MacBook Pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed.\\nIt does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern.\\nI have had nothing but problems since the day I took it out of the box!\\nMy first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program.\\nIt would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived.\\nIt took Toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem.\\nThen just the other day, my left \"mouse\" button snapped!\\nBeing only 2 months old, I am not a happy camper!\\nBuyer Beware.\\nthis one, in my opinion, might be a lemon!\\nIt rarely works and when it does it\\'s incredibly slow.\\nI have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months!\\n*IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD LAPTOP, THIS IS NOT IT!\\nLike the price and operation.\\nSome features arent friendly ( volume wheel, sound quality, etc.\\nBut, for the cost this is a

thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel.\\nI think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive, but I rather have a hard copy.\\nIf what you need is a machine to do some surfing, email checking, word processing, and watching a movie or two, this is the machine you want.\\nIt\\'s priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box.\\nNice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours, or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents.\\nthe screen/video resolution won\\'t increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60\\nThat being said, it still runs video in full screen decently.\\nThe sound is a bit quiet if you\\'re on a plane, this can easily be overcome

and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.\\nSpeakers doesn\\'t sound that great.\\nLove the speed, especially!\\nSo glad I decided to upgrade!\\nI\\'ve owned this labtop for less then two months, already the mouse button has broke.\\nStill under warrenty so called Toshiba, no help at all.\\nI\\'m stuck w/ a broken computer.\\nWill not buy another Toshiba, this is my second, not happy w/ either.\\nI love its solid build, light wt and excellent battery life (for now).\\nExcellent LED monitor and well equipped.\\nI love the Apple products.\\nThe Toshiba Mini Notebook, Model NB 305-N410BL, is a great little computer.\\nIt is easy to use, its keyboard easily accommodates large hands, and its weight is fantasic.\\nUpgrading from Windows 7 Starter, thru Windows 7 Home Premium, to Windows 7 Professional was a snap;\\nboth upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary Product Key.\\nOther installed features, such as certain printer software, are also most attractive.\\nEver since I bought this laptop, so far I\\'ve experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines.\\nI constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.\\nToshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you\\'ll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don\\'t have your history list of your calls right in front of them.\\nIt\\'s a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.\\nAnd at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory stick they recomended).\\nLong story short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn\\'t ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.\\nWas this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba?\\nI\\'ll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba.\\nRemember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product.\\nAll I can say is W-O-W.\\nThis laptop is insane!!!\\nIt\\'s so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with.\\nI bought a protector for my key pad and it works great :)\\nThis is definitely a computer worth the money;\\nThe mouse is a little bit different than what you\\'re used to though- it has one big flat panel and one full bar (instead of two separate ones) to click with- but you get used to it quite quickly.\\nAND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer (when they have a certain promotion/offer going, of course)!\\nOverall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.\\nThe Apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you :)\\nObviously, this Macbook is P-E-R-F-E-C-T for me because it does exactly what I need in an easy-to-function way.\\nDEFINITELY recommended!!!\\nNot a bad laptop, it\\'s a bit slow, but gets the job done.\\nThe lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months.\\nI could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat.\\nupon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told, was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.\\neven though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.\\nDealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture.\\nEnglish must have been his third or fourth language.\\nHis language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test, and it was failing.\\nafter trying to get some help he disconnected on me.\\nAfter 4 days, being denied 6 times and told off once, I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt.\\nThen they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me.\\nAfter they found no other way, they told me to courier it to them(since they don\\'t allow the use of the post office) at my expense, and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn\\'t be covered.\\nI managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me.\\nThey really do have the worlds very worst repair service.\\nThis computer gets very hot, before shutting down.\\nIt is not ideal for children because of the temp.\\nI Contacted HP\\xa0\\xa0about this situation and was given excuses, without results.\\nThey didn\\'t even try to assist me or even offer a replacement.\\nI will never purchase a HP again ever.\\nLet\\'s just get this out of the way, I love Apple!\\nBut the Macbook is the best!\\nIt is super easy to use.\\nAll you have to do is turn it on and it works.\\nIt is very durable, I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet.\\nI don\\'t do any high tech stuff on it, just write papers, check mail, and sometimes play games, so I can\\'t reccomend it if you are in the computer field.\\nIn the past four years I\\'ve had it I have never once gotten a virus.\\nI did have to replace the battery once, but that was only a couple months ago and it\\'s been working perfect ever since.\\nI would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use, stylish, fun, awesome computer.\\nAlso it is very good for college students who just need a reliable, easy to use computer.\\nThis laptop does everything I need it to very well.\\nThe best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features.\\nThe screen is bright and the keyboard is nice;\\nI find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would.\\nBattery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos.\\nFor those that care about noise this thing doesn\\'t really make any;\\nthe i3 processor doesn\\'t seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on.\\nI took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.\\nI wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff.\\nOnce I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds.\\nThis is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine;\\nmy niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn\\'t require a dedicated video card.\\nOverall I am very satisfied with the purchase.\\nGreat, quick laptop for the money.\\nRight size and weight for portability.\\nBattery life needs more life.\\nBattery is not upgradable to a longer life battery.\\nI love everything about it.\\nThe only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in.\\nI would like at least a 4 hr. battery life.\\nOtherwise, all other features are a 1\\nThis mac is great!\\nlightweight, long battery life, excellent transition from PC;\\nTHIS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE SINCE WE PURCHASED IT.\\nI will NEVER buy (Refurbished) again, I don\\'t cae how cheap it is.\\nJust don\\'t waste your time and money on this.\\nI tried giving it 0 stars but I had to choose at least one, but IMO NO STARS\\nSummary: Dont buy HP.\\nIf you buy, pray you dont have major prolems.\\nRuns Hot\\nI thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an Apple product.\\nAfter a little more than a year of owning my MacBook Pro, the monitor has completely died.\\nThis purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks, and I am impressed with the intuition of the design, the beauty of the product, and the excellent technological advances associated with it.\\nThen 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro.\\nNow they are believers in the product.\\nIt is easy to use, has great screen quality, and every so light weight.\\nThis little netboook is helping me get work done!\\nI homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat.\\nI am first time Mac Buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the Mac offers.\\nI bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her, it\\'s very lightweight, and the response for the computing she\\'s doing (Internet focused activity: mail, research, etc.) is excellent;\\nThe overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she\\'d recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook.\\nIf you\\'re looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive game, you\\'d be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market.\\nprevious laptops were pc\\'s, still have them, but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system.\\nstill testing the battery life as i thought it would be better, but am very happy with the upgrade.\\nProbably as good as you can get in a netbook, does everything I ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses.\\nHas met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device.\\nSo far, so good!\\nI\\'ve been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory.\\nI don\\'t understand why only Windows 7 Starter is included.\\nStrong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed\\nThis device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers.\\nEnjoy that Toshib force and durability unparalleled\\nNeeds longer lasting battery, More than 1 to 2 Hrs.\\nNeeds Power and Mouse Cable to Plug in back instead of side, In the way of operating a mouse in small area.\\nFor the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop.\\nComfterbale to use light easy to transport.\\nI love this product because it is Toshiba and its 15.6\".\\nIt has no camera but, I can always buy and install one easy.\\nI had a USB connect but, i can\\'t use it because it is not compatible.\\nThat\\'s the downside for me.\\nBut, I would recommend this product.\\nSatisfy what I paid for it.\\nGood monitor and performed well.\\nI am using the external speaker- sound is good.\\nBest thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs.\\nI recommend for word processing and internet users.\\nThe games included are very good games.\\nI would highly recommend this one to my friends\\nI bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio.\\nIt works great for general internet use, Microsoft Office apps, home bookkeeping, etc.\\nIt doesn\\'t have a lot of frills, but I didn\\'t need any, and being able to buy what I needed, and not more than I needed was very important.\\nThis computer I used daily nice compact design.\\nExcellent speed for processing data.\\nAnd if you are a game player it works with World Of Warcraft wonderfully.\\nAll in all great item highly recommend it.\\ni would have to say that overall its great!\\nAside from the trial software and the short battery life, lack of a webcam, its great.\\nFast, great visual!\\nOh yea, has no numeric pad on the side.\\n2nd Best computer in the world  only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches  to make less easier for people to hack into\\nMy favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen.\\nGreat wifi too.\\nThe screen is a little glary, and I hated the clicking buttons, but I got used to them.\\nOverall for the money this is a good deal.\\nThere is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer.\\nThe speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better.\\nwhile the keyboard itself is alright, the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons.\\nI am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite, I like the extra features, I love the windows 7 home premium.\\nThe battery life has not decreased since I bought it, so i\\'m thrilled with that.\\nI also love the design, the looks, the feel, and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull.\\nI would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend.\\nCouldnt not use it.\\nTried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk.\\ndefective software.\\nreturned it to walmart.\\nI would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front.\\nI also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen.\\nI went to Toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it.\\nOne of them seems to have worked.\\nIts a good laptop for its value.\\nRegistration/1st use is easy.\\nFeatures like the font are very block-like and old school.\\nWould like more trendy, high tech features.\\nThe start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking.\\nKeys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet.\\nCame fully loaded - good.\\nSeems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications (ie Internet tabs, programs, etc) simultaneously.\\nI\\'m really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer.\\nGraphics are clean and sharp, internet interfaces are seamless.\\nOnly issue is that it is a little slow, and I\\'m fixing that by adding more RAM.\\nSound card is limited though.\\nThe laptop is very lightweight, can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight.\\nIt is small enough to fit in one of my purses!\\nWindows 7 Starter is terrific (no you can\\'t change the background) but I don\\'t need to, I use it just for school work.\\nThe battery life is amazing, the versitility is outstanding.\\nThe ease of set up was terrific.\\nI was even able to uninstall McAffe and install one of my Symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever.\\nI had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity, because it is very sensitive.\\nKeyboard is great, very quiet for all the typing that I do.\\nScreen is crystal clear, yes it\\'s small - but it\\'s a netbook!\\nAwesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college.\\nI couldn\\'t believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge.\\nI loaded windows 7 via Bootcamp and it works flawlessly!\\nSimply amazing computer!!\\nI really like the Mac 15.4in. Notebook, but its very pricey.\\nLove the graphics, awesome programs (including Garageband), and really cool default background.\\nBut, like I said before, the only reason I don\\'t currently have a Mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey.\\nWaiting for the i7 was well worth it, great value for the price.\\nBigger HD, better graphics card, and a bid HD.\\nThere is nothing to complain about the system.\\nI have used PC\\'s and converting to this MacBook Pro was easy.\\nIf you have the money I suggest going for the i7.\\nI occassionaly use it for work via VPN and it has not given me any problems.\\nThe screen is nice and the images comes very clear, the keyboard and the fit just feels right.\\nI consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need.\\nThe price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop.\\nI\\'ts nice to have the higher-end laptops, but this fits my budget and the features I need.\\nI normally dont participate in reviews/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts...\\nanother satisfied customer.\\nThe apple MacBook is the best investment that I have ever made.\\nThe newer MacBook that I have purchased is one of the best computers.\\nI am a college student and it has been very useful.\\nIt has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer.\\nIt has a lot of memory and a great battery life.\\nIt is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed.\\nIts white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes.\\nIphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites.\\nThe internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily.\\nI have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me.\\nThe screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use, very important for use quick typers.\\nOverall, this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase!\\nThe graphics are stunning.\\nIt\\'s wonderful for computer gaming.\\nI would definitely suggest this laptop!\\nIt is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all.\\nIt has many great programs, such as ILife, iPhotos and others.\\niLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC.\\nIn addition, all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations.\\nThis comes in very handy for me as an educator.\\niPhotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos.\\nIt allows you to automatically upload photos to your Facebook account with one click.\\nIn addition, there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture.\\nIf you are looking for something reliable, this is the laptop for you.\\nThis computer was awful!\\nI will never buy another computer from Dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how I was treated by the company.\\nThe computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it.\\nIt does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it.\\nThe system it comes with does not work properly, so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all.\\nWhen calling Dell for help, reurn, or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it.\\nOne year of trying to fix the computer by myself, with help of friends, and even help from computer experts I have given up on trying to fix it.\\nThis computer was awful, I would never recomend it to another person.\\nThose moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall?\\nYeah, I wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire.\\nThat\\'s how frustrating it was.\\nIt is so simple to use, I use it more than my desktop.\\nIt is well worth the money it cost, Very good investment.\\nThe new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing.\\nThe speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied.\\nBOUGHT FROM WAL-MART, I BELIEVE THAT THIS LAPTOP WAS A REPAIRED ITEM.\\nTHIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE----BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY.\\nNOW AM VERY APREHENSIVE ABOUT TOSHIBA LAPTOPS.\\nWILL NOT EVERY BUY ANOTHER--------LOU\\nThis is a great value for the money.\\nThis is a great computer.\\nWe haven\\'t had any problems with it at all.\\nThe body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up.\\nOverall though, for the money spent it\\'s a great deal.\\nBut let me tell you, the mac book pro is so professional.\\nIts very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer.\\nFor example, when my husband turns the light out while I\\'m on the computer. the screen brightness automatically adjusts.\\nIt is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted.\\nOh, it is such a great piece of equipment.\\nIts Office compatible, but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs.\\nI get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you\\'re restricted to the width of your body for computing room.\\nVery long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings).\\nI upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home, and it runs just fine.\\nI play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive.\\nI wouldn\\'t play a first-person shooter with this, mind, but if you wanted to run MS Office, email, chat, download a video, listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store, and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in, I\\'d highly recommend checking this out.\\nThe downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I\\'d stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week.\\nAdditional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user\\'s liking.\\nEverything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point.\\nLOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!\\nIt really is perfect for work and play.\\nI am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it.\\nEverything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome.\\nThe only thing that isn\\'t perfect about this netbook is the speakers, they are not loud at all but I expected that.\\nI upgraded it\\'s RAM to 2GB, I am very happy with it.\\nlots of preloaded software.\\nthe only problem is that i had to add 1 gb RAM, the computer was kinda slow.\\ntosiba has a good reputation, my llast computer was an acer.\\nthis is starting off good.\\nWhat a great little laptop.\\nMaybe not the cutting edge (Satellite L455D) but it is a workhorse.\\nI bought it to use in college and it is perfect.\\nI dual boot with Linux and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly.\\nI made a perfect decision when I bought the Toshiba!\\nExcellent product for the money.\\nNo problems, no lock ups, no disappointments.\\nNot super fancy, but not super expensive either.\\nHighly recommend for daily use.\\nThe Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks.\\nI have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed.\\nToshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done.\\nI would tell the technician I knew\\xa0exactly\\xa0what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in.\\nThis computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions.\\nAs well as having the plug in the computer come loose.\\nSo having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.\\nIt still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there.\\nThe Mac Book Pro performs flawlessly.\\nNever had a single problem, and don\\'t have to worry about viruses.\\nWhile I mostly use it for email, internet and gaming, I\\'m confident all other applications live up to the high standard I\\'ve come to appreciate from Mac laptops.\\nWorth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment.\\nRight out of the box, this little netbook did everything I asked of it, including streaming the everyday video you\\'re bound to encounter checking mail and websites (my biggest complaint previously).\\nIt even has a great webcam, and Skype works very well.\\nThe fact that you can spend over $100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine.\\nThe Windows 7 Starter is, in my opinion, a great way to think about using your netbook: basics, basics, basics.\\nI wiped nearly everything off of it, installed OpenOffice and Firefox, and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price.\\nThis netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop (my wife and I have another laptop), or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks.\\nI use this for my tutoring business, and since I\\'m always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!).\\nASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks, and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them.\\nlittle short on RAM but you get what you pay for.\\nthe hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer, left right and front.\\nthe headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones/mic, not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person.\\nCords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction.\\nI love windows 7 but i can\\'t give Toshiba any credit for that, unless y\\'all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time.\\nI was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty.\\nThe computer was shipped to their repair depot\\xa0 on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned.\\nThey were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place.\\nThe computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.\\nThe computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue.\\nInstead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air? to Louisville Ky.\\nAnd Toshiba is totally unconcerned.\\nThe reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter.\\nWe don\\'t Mind and You don\\'t Matter.\\nI would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter.\\nWhen it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you don\\'t matter.\\nWindows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service.\\nI\\'ve tried going back to XL but there still problems.\\nThe technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother.\\nJust a bunch of idiots who\\'s English as a 5th language is forced at best.\\nI\\'m all for saving money but Dell needs to step it up.\\nGood price.\\nBasic computer.\\nDidn\\'t work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop (same make/model).\\nIt has worked fine.\\nHandles all my basic media needs easily.\\nCan listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display.\\nIt is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not.\\nIt\\'s a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs.\\nIt has served my needs quite nicely for the most part.\\nThe 2 GB of RAM is plenty, able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown.\\nMy one complaint with this laptop is that I\\'ve noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.\\nThis is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I\\'m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.\\nOther than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.\\nLet me start with the good:So awesome.\\nGreat OS, fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port.\\nThis one has had the same effect.\\nThe improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive.\\nThe Unibody construction is solid, sleek and beautiful.\\nIt is everything I\\'d hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy.\\nFor the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy.\\nIt\\'s still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.\\nThe reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me (I prefer it dark) or if you can crank up the brightness.\\nThe statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it\\'s a lie.\\nI challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.\\nThe first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.\\nEnabling the battery timer is useless.\\nThe \"Time remaining\" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.\\nIt\\'s so bad that I\\'m thinking I only got half a battery or something.\\nI know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.\\nMy only other complaint is that it gets really hot.:-)\\nIf you buy this - don\\'t go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you\\'ll be perfectly satisfied.\\nThe pro is a great product, I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge (the edges hurt my wrists).\\nOther than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more.\\nGreat product by Apple with the new great looking design.\\nI actually had the hard drive replaced twice, the mother board once, the dvd drive twice, then they FINALLY agreed to replace it, (ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS!)only to get another \"HP/Compaq\" piece of crap.\\nIt was slow, locked up, and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months!\\nSo, buyers beware!\\nIt is made better, thicker, and all out tough!\\nI droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and IT is still working with NO issues!\\nI love the easy to see screen, and It works well for work, persoal or just play.\\nI tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba.\\nMy friends or children use that when they need to borrow the Net =) When I out grow this Meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one ANd I will be buying only TOSHIBA!\\nI just love this lap top, I just wish it were all silver or they had all black.\\nThat is my only complaint!\\nLOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET!\\nWOULD PAY MORE FOR IT IF I HAD TOO!\\nI recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it!\\nIt meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling.\\nI am totally satisfied with my little toshie!\\nFrom the moment I opened the box to the present it has been a great joy.\\nIt is always reliable, never bugged and responds well.\\nI love the operating system and the preloaded software.\\nThis machine delivers.\\nIt is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine.\\nIt is a bit heavy.\\nIt would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required.\\nHad some trouble finding a case that it would fit in.\\nThis is an over-sized, 18-inch laptop.\\nIt wouldn\\'t fit in most 17-inch bags.\\nI was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard doesn\\'t light up on this model.\\nIt also does not have bluetooth.\\nYou\\'ll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them.\\nI was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing, I took it for granted that these features were standard.\\nOverall, still a very nice machine.\\nBoots up fast and runs great!\\nI\\'m pleased.\\nThe acer one compuer is a great computer.\\nI didn\\'t want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice.\\nIts fast, has High definition quality in the videos.\\nThe pictures are clear as can be.\\nIf I had to buy another computer, I would most definetly buy an acer one computer.\\nHeck, if I had enough \\' money, I would but it as a gift for someone.\\nIm glad that it has such great features in it.\\nIt also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home.\\nClear picture on it and everything.\\nThe one down side to it is that when I play a certin game on here, it tends to freeze up sometimes, but thats the only bad thing about this computer.\\nThe acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it, but I like the big screen on it.\\nIts good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies.\\nIm very happy with this computer!\\nIt\\'s solid.\\nLove the stability of the Mac software and operating system.\\nThe only downfall is a lot of the software I have won\\'t work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it.\\nIt seems to be incompatible with everything else.\\nBut the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X.\\ni love to use it it is esay and light.\\nthis laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with.\\ni needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria.\\nthis laptop is great for work and doing my pictures.\\ni am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well, but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing.\\nthe programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm.\\ni can use it for all of my needs.\\ni give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me.\\nif this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again.\\ni think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go.\\nFrom the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer!\\nThe OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.\\nThe track pad to me is what really stands out though, you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad, awesome thinking Apple!\\nThe OS is also very user friendly, even for those that switch from a PC, with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS!\\nApple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience!\\nFrom the start, when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine.\\nThe ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it.\\nThe screen is bright and clear, the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice.\\nFast, fast and fast, the web pages just fly by.\\nI had my IWORKS, Itunes, Email, MS Office, network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour.\\nThat includes transferring my music and movies.\\nGood bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors!!!!\\nSkype is just so dang cool with this machine too.\\nIf your time is worth anything to you, if you are tired of rebooting, reformatting, reinstalling, trying to find drivers, if you want a computer to work for you for a change, make the change to this computer.\\nIt is light and the battery last a very long time.\\nVery fast boot up and shut down.\\nLet me tell you, this machine is great.\\nPurchased for development purposes, but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing, e-mail, etc.\\nI thought learning the Mac OS would be hard, but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC.\\nThe most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing.\\nThe only time I have restarted is during system updates.\\ngreat machine if you want to drop the cash for one.\\nOk, this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple.\\nThe case is carved out of a single block of aluminum.\\nThe processor screams, and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions, most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software.\\nI have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one.\\nI like it so much, I bought another just for my wife.\\nTook it back as it was defective.\\nPage just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something.\\nCouldn\\'t keep a page up you were working on!\\nwas a great deal i will give that.\\nthe laptop preformed pretty well.\\nit cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once.\\nit has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again.\\nthe mouse on the pad, the left button always sticks.\\nthe mouse is way way way to sensitve.\\ni tried turning it done but it did nothing.\\nthe mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too.\\nits not bad just VERY VERY annoying.\\nthink i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop.\\nI am very happy with this laptop.\\nFor the price and what I get out of it has exceeded my expectations.\\nI always have used a tower home PC and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance.\\nAmazing Quality!\\nPlus stylish.\\nThe big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc!\\nThe flaws are, this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X.\\nMac is not made for gaming.\\nBUT there\\'s this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows.\\nSecond, it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated\\nWas not happy with one of the programs on it.\\nIt was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer, was a six month trial.\\nAlso, the extended warranty was a problem.\\nThe extended warranty for the $4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu.\\nOverall the computer is very easy to use, the screen is perfect, great computer, my daughter loves.\\nI finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.\\nI did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased.\\nSo I\\'m disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority.\\nI just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I won\\'t have to worry about a crash.\\nI bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly\\xa0dissatisfied with it.\\nThe Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning.\\nIt freezes, and it always shows that there is an error, so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it.\\nI tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem.\\nWell, I started using Google Chrome, which is a little better, but it freezes too sometimes.\\nThis Notebook restarts every time there is a new update, so if you don\\'t save your files and information, everything will be lost.\\nAnother issue I have with it is the battery.\\nMaybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden.\\nThere is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when I click on it it says: \" Consider replacing your battery\" and it does not hold full charge.\\nIt is not even a year old yet, so I would\\xa0definitely not recommend it to anyone.\\nDon\\'t waste your money!\\nThe laptop is gorgeous.\\nIt is sleek, smooth, and lightweight.\\nIt is easily portable and I take it everywhere I go and might require internet access.\\nThe screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution.\\nThe processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications.\\nIt is quiet and a real joy to watch work.\\nI love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky!!\\nOverall this laptop is great.\\nIt has plenty of memory, lots of hard drive, and great graphics.\\nIt runs very quiet too which is a plus.\\nThe only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible.\\nThey only stay charged a little over an hour.\\nLaptops are usually used on the go, so why not give you a better battery?\\nThe processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing.\\nThe notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV.\\nIt is a cheap throw together.\\nSave your money and go for a better device.\\nThis laptop is a great price and has a sleek look.\\nRuns smooth and quick.\\nI wish it had a webcam though, then it would be perfect!\\nI Love my new computer!\\nIts fast and another thing I like is that it has three USB ports.\\nI love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both!\\nThank you for your great product!\\nEverything about this computer is easy to use.\\nwonderful features.\\nThe only thing is that the battery won\\'t last more than 1/2 an hour.\\nIt discharges too quickly.\\nKind of annoying, but I still love the laptop.\\nIt has good speed and plenty of hard drive space.\\nThe only downfall is the volume control.\\nThe wheel that turns the volume up and down doesn\\'t work in real time.\\nI have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute.\\nI bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since.\\nI love it so much.\\nIt has come into good use for my finances, scheduling, my parents business expenses, and it is definitely amazing for gaming.\\nThe best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once, it never slows down.\\nIt\\'s just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open.\\nIt works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box.\\nGREAT INVESTMENT!\\nThe price and features more than met my needs.\\nThe feature are good enough for what I need.\\nI love my macbook pro!\\nMy laptop is almost 2yrs old and I have never had any problems with it.\\nIf you are a PC user looking to convert I would HIGHLY recommend it!\\nIt may take a little getting used to but you don\\'t have to worry about viruses or other headaches.\\nNot to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs.\\nI am ADDICTED to photo booth!\\nIt is SO much fun to play with.\\nI work with kids and they love making short videos on there.\\nI am able to organize my pics, music and files easily.\\nIf you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac!\\nI love the keyboard.\\nThe display is awesome.\\nOnly thing I would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive.\\nBut other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers.\\nI think this computer is super lame.\\nI dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing.\\nI decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it.\\nIt doesnt work worth a damn.\\nThe display is beyond horrible.\\nI can not even read what I am writing half of the time.\\nThere are so many things wrong with this product, it just makes me want to set my self on fire!\\nI would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage.\\nNot to mention it has shit gigs.\\nI could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage.\\nDo yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop.\\nI bought this last week, and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse stopped responding.\\ngot another 1, and same issue.\\nI am taking back today.\\nDon\\'t waste your money or time.\\nVery dissappointed becase I have had toshibas for years, and never a issue.\\nSTOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one-year warranty was up.\\nToshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it.\\nApparently there is a manufacturing defect, something with the amount of thermal paste.\\nTOSHIBA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM.\\nWhen I called Toshiba, they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $35 for the phone call, even though they didn\\'t offer any technical support.\\nI loved the netbook (minus the fact that it was windows OS) until this started happening.\\nBut if you can\\'t make your product last more than a year, you will not get my business again.\\nI\\'ve had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it!\\nIn those three years, I\\'ve had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily.\\nMy power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership, so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan.\\nIn the three years I\\'ve had my MacBook Pro, I have never had a virus on my computer, and I do a lot of work on the internet.\\nThe iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product.\\nI highly recommend this product!\\nNeeds constant repair.\\nFirst the screen goes completely out.\\nThen HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up, not able to connect.\\nNow the screen is going darker, darker, darker.\\nHP is more interested in selling extended warranties (which cost more than the netbook new) then they are in helping or fixing.\\nOh yeah, don\\'t forget the expensive shipping to and from HP.\\nI\\'v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand.\\nSo far so good with this laptop.\\nFan vents to the side, so no cooling pad needed, great feature!\\nScreen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive.\\nMemory is upgradable.\\nThe only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys.\\nThey click.\\nsounds like a typewriter, but if you can get past that, this is a great laptop for a little money!\\nI HATE this one.\\nVista is a nightmare.\\nNo tutorials on the display.\\nThe book is useless.\\nThe machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your HDTV.\\nThinking about returning it\\nThe Macbook is a fantastic laptop.\\nYou will love this macbook if you choose to buy it.\\nThe macbook rarely requires a hard reboot.\\nIt just works flawlessly!\\nIts hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action.\\nI honestly love my mac, thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict.\\nThis was purchased for my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised.\\nIt had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one.\\nIt made the computer much easier to use and navigate.\\nKeyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.\\nThis system came loaded with Windows 7 Starter.\\nSo far, so good.\\nWhen I got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school, I had a hard time from beginning.\\nI feel that it was poorly put together, because once in a while different plastic\\xa0pieces\\xa0would come off of it.\\nQuite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned.\\nFor me, five stars is not enough.\\nI love the 15\" MacBook Pro.\\nMy parents bought it for me as a graduation gift, and i\\'m totally (almost kind of maybe definitely) obsessed with it.\\nIt was very easy to just pick up and use--\\nIt did not take long to get used to the Mac OS.\\nI love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for (Internet, artwork), and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable.\\nThere are several programs for school or office use (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc.), music (Garageband), photo management (Photo Booth, iPhoto), video-editing or movie-making (iMovie), etc.\\nThe built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services.\\niTunes is a handy music-management program, and it is essential for anyone with an iPod.\\nAll-in-all, I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone.\\nI love it!\\nThey definitely have a superior product!\\nIts not just slow on the internet, its slow in general.\\nNo I am generous calling it slow.\\nits more like a snail crawl.\\nhe can\\'t stand it.\\nI can\\'t begin to say how disappointed I am.\\nI should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer.\\nthe key bindings take a little getting used to, but have loved the Macbook Pro.\\nDelivery was early too.\\nIt allows me to do everything I need from a computer and more.\\nWith awesome graphics and assuring security, it\\'s perfect!\\nI\\'d recommend this laptop to anyone!\\nThe Toshiba Satellite laptop is  DESIGNED  to fail !\\nThe board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.\\nToshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it.\\nI actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.\\nThen after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I\\'d have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.\\nIt has far exceeded my expectations for power, storage, and abilitiy.\\nIt is easy to navigate and update programs.\\nI\\'ve never had problems with viruses.\\nMy next laptop will also be a Mac!\\nI would like to tell you about the best laptop I just got from Mac.\\nMy mac laptop is fabulous in both areas.\\nIt gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit.\\nThe Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy, and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer, which is also a mac.\\nI would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could.\\nIn my line of work, I often have to take work home, and this makes it so easy.\\nI do transcription work on the side, and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well.\\nThe apple care has never failed me, and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well.\\nI will only buy apple laptops from now on.\\nGreat laptop for school, easy to use for beginners in the household.\\nKeyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable.\\nBattery life could be better but overall for the price and Toshiba\\'s reputation for laptops it\\'s great!\\nMy MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment.\\nFrom the build quality to the performance, everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple.\\nThe system constantly overheats, the battery life is too short, the case is coming apart, and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly.\\nI would not recommend this product to anyone.\\nScreen is awesome, battery life is good.\\nReally like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints.\\nGood laptop for the money.\\nSpeakers don\\'t get that loud, but good enough.\\nThey don\\'t crash.\\nIf a website ever freezes (which is rare), its really easy to force quit.\\nNever been hacked.\\nNo viruses.\\nI have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free, even without the warranty.\\nA mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense.\\nIts also FUN to use!\\nThe programs are great, like iphoto (love the editing capabilities), imail (which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad), imovie, etc.\\nShe said its very user friendly.\\nHowever, I love this particular Mac because its very fast, great size, and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad.\\nI am very happy I bought this Mac, well worth the extra money.\\nNow that I have it I see that I really needed this for much more.\\nI run Dreamweaver, Final Cut Pro 7, Photoshop, Safari, Firefox, MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time.\\nI have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.\\nI highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door.\\nThat was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought.\\nMy MacBook Pro is no exception.\\nSince I\\'ve had this computer I\\'ve only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.\\nI also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.\\nThe computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well.\\nI would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality!\\nShiny\\nThis Laptop is the Best of the best!\\nThe Awesomest of the awesomest.\\nIt is so great, I can Hardly ever take my hands off it!\\nMy friends are in awe every time they come over!\\nI got it for Christmas, and I was so excited to set it up!\\nIt is super fast, and always loads.\\nI am just amazed.\\nThe only bad part is the size/weight.\\nIt\\'s like 9 punds, but if you can look past it, it\\'s GREAT!\\nIf you don\\'t like fingerprints, this might not be the laptop for you.\\nIt super shiny, so you can see the fingerprints easily.\\nAll for such a great price.\\nIt\\'s color is even cool.\\nAnother Great thing is the Beast graphics.\\nThey are so realistic I am just speechless.\\nI let my friend borrow it, and she knows nothing about computers, and she used it with ease.\\nThe cool thing about this is anyone can use it.\\nI don\\'t know how I could ever live without my Qousmio.\\nI own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I\\'ve had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb, 201\\nIve had to call tech support many times.\\nEach time taking about 1 day or so.\\nI had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly.\\nI had to pay for the shipping!\\nI will never buy anything from HP again!\\nThe Toshiba Satellite has been more than I expected for the price.\\nTHis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse.\\nYou can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever.\\nfor being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is.\\nwhen i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke.\\nbut after i got used to it i love it.\\nthe size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming.\\nit has 3 usb ports, 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion.\\nthe only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have.\\noverall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive.\\ni use my mac all the time, i love the software, the way it takes a short time to load things, how easy it is to use and most of all how you don\\'t have to worry about viruses.\\nWith a mac you don\\'t have to worry about antivirus software or firewall, it\\'s so wonderful.\\nAll apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything, no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.\\nthis computer will last you at least 7 years, thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.\\neverything about a mac is wonderful, it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system, but you will learn fast and its all worth it.\\nNot working = bad\\nI spent 2200 dollars on a \"top of the line laptop\".\\nI got the blue screen of death the first month I got it.\\n1) Payed $2200 for a \"premium\" laptop\\n2) Blue screen first month\\n3) Horrible customer support-they lost my laptop for a month-got it back 3 months later\\n4) Laptop still did not work, blue screen within a week...\\n5) Cut my losses and sold it for parts\\nthis company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this \"never\" happen...\\nwhat an elegant, wonderful machine.\\nI\\'m making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the \\'old\\' way - and Apple does, indeed, have the better idea.\\nI really wish I had done this years ago.\\nPairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it\\'s a snap.\\nI love it - never had a computer I was so impressed with - and I\\'ve had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE.\\nI tell everyone that I know, friends, family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used.\\nThe computer blinks it shuts off at will.\\nThe letter A stopped working after the first week.\\nwhen i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.\\nso the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault.\\nthey have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem.\\nthey have not sent a new one nor called.\\ni spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus.\\nthen on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east.\\nSo when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand.\\nThen to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.\\nI had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair.\\nGot the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it.\\n3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications.\\nDO NOT BUY GATEWAY COMPUTERS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS HORRIBLE.\\nYOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY.\\nCOMPUTER HAS BEEN AT SERVICE FACILITY MORE THAN IN MY HANDS.\\nI have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied.\\nThe only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones.\\nAnother thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it.\\nThat whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.\\nIt took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.\\nANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke.\\nTo be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.\\nThe graphics are great.\\nThe internet speed is spectacular.\\nThe battery life is probably an hour at best.\\nOh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.\\nI would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.\\nI wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month.\\nI received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst.\\nAt first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again.\\nThis computer doesn\\'t do that well with certain games it can\\'t play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.\\nOh and if thats not bad enough it doesn\\'t come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.\\nthe whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop.\\nI bought a HP Pavilion DV4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer.\\nThe computer is so slow, even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up.\\nThey said it was a computer error on this type of computer.\\nAlso, I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot, and not even sitting on anything to make it hot.\\nWhen the computer has been on for several minutes, it will occasionaly just go off by itself.\\nAlso, the battery does not last very long at all.\\nI would recommend not buying this product.\\nI have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem.\\nI am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with.\\nAlso, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly.\\nAlso, I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines.\\nIt gets stuck all of the time you use it, and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work.\\nSometimes the screen even goes black on this computer.\\nWill probably never buy a HP again.\\nPurchased a Toshiba Lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out.\\nAfter the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace.\\nI hate it.\\nI have had the luxury (sarcasm) of owning 2 of these laptops.\\nThe first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty.\\nDuring that time, I had to send it back 3 times.\\nI paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me.\\nNone of the techs at HP knew what they were doing.\\nThey would repair one thing, send it back and it would still have the same problem.\\nThe processor went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went.\\nI wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble.\\nI had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.\\nI took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty.\\nI sent it back AND THEY LOST IT.\\nI waited and waited and no laptop.\\nFinally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.\\nI waited another month for approval and for them to \"BUILD\" me a new laptop.\\nHere we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.\\nHP didn\\'t fix it.\\nI swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one.\\nin 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.\\n1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in.\\nreturned it.\\n5 months dead again.\\nThey say sorry out of warranty.\\nSummary: They played games with me for the warranty period.\\nNow 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine.\\nThey had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything.\\nNow the machine won\\'t connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I\\'m out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.\\nSo buyer beware when buying Toshiba\\nThey are wonderful, but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat.\\nI burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so I can place it there.\\nI had to call Apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times.\\nFor my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).\\nSteve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby.\\nThe lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.\\nI am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.\\nAnyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.\\nSo I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message.\\nAlso the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook.\\nWould HIGHLY recommend this netbook though.\\nI custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the techie due to his accent.\\nThe computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork.\\nMy laptop cost approximately $2,300 and DIED after only 2-years, 10-months and 18-days of use.\\nAlthough my model was listed as recalled, HP denied my claim.\\nThis laptop leaves alot to be desired, I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice...\\nI bought it from HSN because it was \"bundled\" with extra software, but as it turns out, that software just crashes it more often.....\\nIf you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal.\\nThe repairs were made quickly though I must say, however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me.\\nUnable to boot up this brand new laptop.\\nSpent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support.\\nThey went through asking me open up various components, taking battery out, hard disk apart, and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it.\\nThey are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site.\\nI am going to go back and return at Store I bought from!\\nThis computer had exactly the specifications I needed.\\nSmall enough to use on a long flight, Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips.\\nThe perfect notebook...\\nWhen I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed.\\nThe Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid (I have tried both Motorola and HTC) plugged into the USB port.\\nCalled tech support and got the usual Acer \"We don\\'t support software but for $$$ we can help you\" I explained there was no software involved in booting.\\nNo, tey don\\'t even support their own bios and it \"could be a problem with the bios\" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!\\nNeedless to say a PC that can\\'t support a cell phone is less than useless!\\nWith today\\'s company fighting over marketshare, its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone.\\nI agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.\\nSummary: I\\'ve had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.\\nBut no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!\\nFrustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time.\\nThis was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.\\nThe rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn\\'t even try to acknowledge my question.\\nI\\'m tired of the inept service.\\nIf you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS!!!\\nUnless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can\\'t find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.\\nI\\'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE.\\nHOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK!!!\\nOur Apple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer (Z0J80001) Notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking.\\nI do everything on this computer - check email, facebook, shop, check blogs, write papers, listen to music, and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv.\\nIt pretty much does everything we could ever need, and looks great to boot.\\nApple is always great about the aesthetics of things, they always come up with good looking products.\\nIt didn\\'t take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it\\'s been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better.\\nSo, if you\\'re thinking of a laptop, I would heartily recommend theApple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer (Z0J80001) Notebook for all your needs!\\nIt\\'s great and we will always stick with Apple computers, we have been so happy with them.\\nThe 13\" MacBook Pro is portable, durable, and very capable.\\nIt has a 10 hour battery life when you\\'re doing web browsing and word editing, making it perfect for the classroom or office, and in terms of gaming and movie playing it\\'ll have a battery life of just over 5 hours.\\nIt\\'s also very energy efficient, running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb.\\nIt\\'s graphics aren\\'t bad at all, for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum, easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics.\\nThe operating system and user interface is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing.\\nHowever, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you\\'re gaming).\\nStill, this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work.\\nThey also have a longer service life than other computers (I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks).\\nProbbly the worst decision we ever made!\\nIt has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard!\\npretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were.\\ni love the size of the computer since i play games on it.\\ni also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.\\nalso the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.\\nSo i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer\\nFirst, it does not have a push button to open the lid.\\nIt is held in place magnetically.\\nThere is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that.\\nOnce open, the leading edge is razor sharp.\\nThis is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design.\\nUsing this machine is like a mild form of torture.\\nThe much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare.\\nI lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening.\\nAlso, the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it.\\nI hate to say this, but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then I would.\\nIt is absolutely horrible to use, despite all its so called advanced features.\\nI regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use.\\nIt\\'s a bummer and one out of five is being kind.\\nMy Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary.\\nIn due course, I\\'ll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.\\nBut the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing.\\nI like this machine because its very lightweight...\\nvery convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent...\\n10 hours of battery life is really something else....\\nI highly recommend that you buy this product.\\nIt crashes, and when it goes flat, it just DIES (like a PC, maybe worse) and I loose all my open documents!\\nI Hate it!\\nIt is the easiest computer I have ever used\\nI LOVE IT!\\nI can\\'t say enough good for it!\\nIt\\'s A MAC!!\\nI fine Apple MC373LL/A 2.66GHz 15\" Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go.\\nI like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races.\\nIt\\'s face and depanable.\\nAs a graphic arts a retired instructor I still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .....\\nit\\'s just a great toy to have around.\\nvery very slow laptop.\\ntons of bloatware and junk programs.\\ncan\\'t reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers.\\nkeys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed.\\nlots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small.\\nAmazing machine.\\nIt is a big big, but since it has a 18.4\" screen what would you expect!\\nIt is truly a Desktop Replacement.\\nVery fast and efficient!\\nDoes a great job with video shot on a Canon 5D MKII.\\nVery happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop!\\nThe touchpad is very intuitive, so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again!\\nOf course, I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork, GarageBand, and iMovie.\\nI especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems!\\nThe only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.\\nI also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program.\\nNow I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac!\\nI also got the added bonus of a 30\" HD Monitor, which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh!\\nI never have had a good result with this computer.\\nI was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.\\nThey told me it was my loss even though it was the computer, not  what I\\'ve done.\\nThe hard drive crashed as well, and I had to buy a new  power cord.\\nThey told me to reprogram the computer, and I didn\\'t need  to do that, and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her  life.\\nI don\\'t like this company nor the toshiba brand, and I\\'ll never  buy another one because I\\'ve put more into it then it is worth.\\nI would  rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that  isn\\'t good at all.\\nThe right speaker did not work.\\nAgain, the same problem, the right speaker did not work.\\nI returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund.\\nthe mouse pad and buttons are the worst i\\'ve ever seen.\\nsometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move.\\nthe mouse buttons are hard to push.\\ni cant believe HP put this out.\\ndo not buy you will be disappointed.\\ni\\'m returning mine\\ndell is a decently made pc.\\nthe graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.\\nwith the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch.\\nso in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.\\nI love HP,, it\\'s the only computer/printer we will buy.\\nThis is perfect for her field.\\nAt first when I got this product, I loved it.\\nThe computer itself was fast, ran smoothly, and had no problems.\\nThen, within 5 months, the charger crapped out on me.\\nSo I called Compaq, and after being on the phone for 3 hours, i finally got a replacement which I shouldn\\'t have had a problem getting since it was under warranty.\\n2 months later, the battery went.\\nThey gave me a hard time yet again, but their was a malfunction in the battery itself, it didn\\'t die.\\nTHEN, one month after the warranty expired, the replacement charger went.\\nI had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.\\nNot worth it one bit.\\nThe people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.\\nAlso, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use.\\nApparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth, they come loose.\\nAnd it is impossible to get them back in.\\nStrengths:Well-shaped\\nWeaknesses:A bad videocard!\\nAfter 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off.\\nIt was still working, but there was nothing on the screen.\\nI was said it\\'s videocard.\\nVery disappointed!\\nDidn\\'t expect to repair it at once!\\nDon\\'t buy this model.\\nAn absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will.\\nMine came at $1,700 w/o a DVD burner (!).\\nThe screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary, reduces the screen size and increases the bulk.\\nThe 4 USB ports are nice, but the two on the side only work now and then.\\nKeyboard could use some trimming.\\nDid I mention everything about it, from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK?\\nI\\'m glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC.\\nThe benefits were immediate!\\nAwesome graphics!\\nThe magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great (I even put it to the test by accident)- excellent innovation!\\nThis laptop rocks (only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple doesn\\'t support)!\\nI\\'ve saved a lot of time and headaches so far, using my new MacBook Pro.\\nI have never had any issues or problems with my MacBook Pro so far, and it is still as fast as it was when I first bought it.\\nI especially like the backlit keyboard.\\nIt makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier.\\nIt is also very lightweight, making transporting this computer very easy.\\nThe graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid.\\nI use iphoto all the time, which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike.\\nThe program came with the computer and works beautifully.\\nI definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails.\\nMy hp G60-244dx died after only 16 months.\\nIt started out getting hot after only a few months.\\nAt 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes.\\nI use a cooling pad but it doesn\\'t help.\\nI took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it.\\nI will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro!\\nIt fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing.\\nThis is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it!\\nThe MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile.\\nI love it!\\nI even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, iChat, Photobooth, garage band and more!\\nWe are addicted to the Mac.\\nThis is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone.\\nThe OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it!\\nGreat laptop that offers many great features!\\nLightweight and the screen is beautiful!\\nIt is easy to operate and I have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new Rolls Royce of laptops.\\nBuy it, love it, and I promise you won\\'t regret it.\\nThis computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life.\\nYou will regret it if you buy any dell.\\nDell sucks\\nThe only pro to this computer is it was under $600!\\nEverything is falling apart internally and externally.\\nWith in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down.\\nI am constantly trying to uninstall programs, clean cookies, and delete unused files.\\nNightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan.\\nMore times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection, or the page can\\'t be displayed.\\nIt takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site, then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works.\\nI have Vista, so I am unable to install and uninstall\\xa0 some programs.\\nI can\\'t even install one of the 3 printers I have in my house so I am unable to print.\\nExternally the keys on my keyboard are falling off, after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit, and the screen has a terrible glare.\\nIn short I would never buy a Compaq again.\\nI bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it!\\nIt was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to.\\nThe online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a PC.\\nThe performance is awesome.\\nI will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar.\\nWith all the goodies inside this machine, it is a value.\\nIt is very well built.\\nThe keyboard is top notch.\\nThe touch pad is among the best.\\nThe screen is huge and coloful, but no LED backlighting.\\nThe video card is great for media, and above average for gaming, but not a gamers first choice.\\nThe problem I had with this unit was unresolvable.\\nIt had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use, and would not move past this error.\\nI acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card, but still requires a return.\\nSorry Toshiba, but 1st impressions do count for something.\\nI got the black MacBook two years ago and have never regretted it.\\nSo this was great for me.\\nIt has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs.\\nPlus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work.\\nI also travel with it and it never gives me any problems.\\nBut I am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it.\\nI look forward to years of use, it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well.\\nThe difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space.\\nIt\\'s super fast and a great value for the price!\\nI would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one.\\nA MONTH LATER, we reinstall the OS (Vista).\\nA coupla months later, they change my hard drive.\\nA month or so ago, the freaking motherboard just died.\\nWent silently.\\nOne night I turned the freaking thing off after using it, the next day I turn it on, no GUI, screen all dark, power light steady, hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.\\nTHE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !\\nAnd I\\'m still paying the bloody financing, for a product which didn\\'t last me at least three years !\\nI initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13\" in April, and I loved it.\\nI was so happy with my new Mac.\\nThen the hard drive failed;\\nmy information was all lost (my fault, I know, but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac, the paragon of all computers!\\nSo, after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer, until it froze this morning--completely.\\nI can\\'t even turn it off.\\nIt\\'s catatonic.\\nEven if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if, since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it\\'s \"like new,\" I might have 8 months next time.\\nI would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.\\nGreat battery, speed, display.\\nIt WORKS!\\nMy house is now 100% Macbook.\\nThe Macbook starts fast, doesn\\'t crash, has a fantastic display, is small and light (I have the 13.3\" model), and isn\\'t always complaining about updates, lost connections, errors, blue screens, etc.\\nTHIS is what a laptop is supposed to be.\\nI thought the price was great for the specs.\\nBut after using it a couple of weeks, the overall operation is poor.\\nI hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it.\\nThe keyboard is too slick.\\nI really don\\'t like it, but I am stuck.\\nDell Latitude d620 is not a reliable machine.\\nThe battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.\\nLater it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.\\nThe machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.\\nVERY disappointing:\\nI was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain Flash.\\nWeb access through the 3G network is so slow, it\\'s very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.\\nAfter purchasing this thing, I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera, and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line.\\nHP Pavilion DV9000 Notebook PC      When I first got this computer, it really rocked.\\nBut as time went on I found it almost impossible to keep the thing on-line through wi-fi.\\nEventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on.\\nGuess I\\'ll stay away from HP.\\nMy MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made.\\nI have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it.\\nThe most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead.\\nI love this computer.\\nIts small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere, but still has a big enough screen to get everything done.\\nThe only thing that I don\\'t like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to.\\nGames being the main issue.\\nIt drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can\\'t play it because its not compatable with the software.\\nOther than that I don\\'t have one complaint in the world!\\nThis computer periodically crashes (Office, IPhoto, Safari).\\nIt takes a long time to get on the Web and to change Web Sites.\\nLocks up she searching for updates.\\nIt seems that this computer might be a lemon.\\nI purchased my Macbook Pro Retina from my school since I had a student discount, but I would gladly purchase it from Amazon for full price again if I had too.\\nThe Retina is great, its amazingly fast when it boots up because of the SSD storage and the clarity of the screen is amazing as well.\\nBut if you buy this i would highly recommend that you buy a case and screen protector for this machine as they are known to be quite fragile.\\nCount me as extremely satisfied, it\\'s a perfect computer.\\nI just bought this computer from the Apple Store, and I couldn\\'t be more impressed with it.\\nIt has a stunning retina display, and is very fast.\\nThis computer is good for anything, and it has really superseded my high expectations.\\nAlso, the sound quality from the speakers is crystal clear, and everything is just sleek and smooth.\\nThe HD display is sensational, and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me.\\nNo hardware issues, as is common with any Apple product.\\nGreat product, and couldn\\'t be happier with it.\\nawesome laptop, i love it\\nI love my new ThinkPad!\\nIt gives me everything I need from a computer and with the long lasting battery, it also gives me mobility.\\nI can use it anywhere.\\nIt was a great purchase.\\nAll the sturdy and substantial feel you expect from a Thinkpad.\\nAverage performance on almost every benchmark but priced accordingly.\\nBelow average on the w-fi adapter which I\\'m still trying to get to the bottom of.\\nGreat laptop.\\nFast.\\nWorks very well.\\nWould purchase again.\\nA good value for the money.\\nQuite pleased with it.\\nFast enough for my purposes.\\nNo bloatware from third party parasites to uninstall.\\nExcellent keyboard and crisp screen.\\nBattery could be better but it has robust processor and plenty of RAM so that is a trade off I suppose.\\nI\\'m glad to have it and it showed up in only a few days.\\nThe laptop itself is very good, it could be better, but not bad at all for it\\'s price point.\\nIt does everything I need.\\nThe big deal with this was Windows 7.\\nWhen I saw this I grabbed it.\\nIt has met all my needs.\\nJust what I expected.\\nI don\\'t have any complains about this computer\\nOutstanding laptop and very well built.\\nThe retina display is fantastic.\\nOne of the best thing i have bought in years.\\nGreat PC, light and powerful.\\nIs just amazing.=)\\nThe glare of the glossy-retina display is unbearable.\\nDo not buy a mac until this issue is resolved.\\nPerforms as advertised, if not better!\\nSuper light weight (I never cared either way about weight until now).\\nFeels like solid state.\\nWONDERFUL machine;\\nglad I bought it.\\nTiny, forgivable drawback - no ethernet cable outlet.\\nBut that\\'s not a deal-breaker.\\nSUPER LAPTOP!!\\nWill probably get another one for my wife!\\na bit ugly,but works good\\nI like the design rather sleek and light.\\nI will give advise any prospective buyers this is not great laptop, Its good for web browsing and word processing\\nFantastic for the price - just wish it the keys were illuminated.\\nIf your on a budget.... Save up longer.\\nThis laptop isn\\'t worth a single cent.\\nI couldn\\'t even install linux on it.\\nWindows runs very poorly.\\nJust save your money and get something better.\\nawesome price for a laptop that lasts more than 8 hours without recharging!\\nawesome!\\nThis laptop is a complete cheap junk.\\nBy just looking at it you will realize it\\'s crap.\\nIt\\'s not what you pay for.\\nThe case is made from cheap plastic.\\nIn the description it said there is Bluetooth but no there isn\\'t.\\nI\\'m warning you, You\\'re wasting your money on this\\nLove the computer.\\nHate Windows 8.1!\\nIt dosn\\'t even have a disc compartment\\nHad to return the computer.\\nKeeps freezing\\nNo ethernet outlet\\nDisc drive will not open or function\\nOdd - unusual Dell Commands\\nWould have exchanged instantly - but had to use as if for College immediately.\\nUnimpressed.\\nTerrific laptop.\\nWorks beautifully.\\ngreat price.\\njust what we needed for our daughter to do her on line math class\\nThis is a great home computer.\\nIt is very, very quiet.\\nThe only reason I didn\\'t give it a 5 star is, I feel I have to reach so far to type on the key board.\\nYou also have to press firmly on the keys.\\nOtherwise this is a great computer great prices.\\nWas easy to set up and has been easy to learn to use it.\\nWorks good and is fast enough for me.\\nGood product for a good price.\\nIt was too cheaply constructed.\\nIt also gave me an introduction to Windows 8, which I hope will be discontinued it the future.\\nThe Computer Is Horrible Its To Slow.\\nThe Thing That You Insert CDs Into Won\\'t Open.\\nnot a good computer at all.\\nWe returned two days later.\\nThey were excellent to handle our return and post our refund back into our account the next day.\\nGreat price and computer!\\nThey loved it.\\nIt\\'s easy to operate and it\\'s very light (my parents are almost 60 yo, they can\\'t carry a heavy computer while traveling).\\nBut here\\'s something I hadn\\'t realized before buying it: there isn\\'t an optical drive, which means NO CDs or DVDs!\\nThis product was DOA.\\nFired up and worked for the first day and then the display died on my wife while she was taking a timed test.\\nWould not recommend.\\nPretty good laptop.\\nGood for basic stuff.\\nDon\\'t try to use to play any pc games or anything.\\nJust for simple web browsing and media streaming.\\nPretty premium feel for the low price.\\nI have so much trouble turning the computer on.\\nIt comes on for seconds then shuts itself off.\\nMy mistake was to not research this one, no DVD and no place to insert my ad card to download pictures.\\nI should have waited to find a higher quality computer.\\ni\\'m very happy,this laptop is beatifull, is\\'nt slow at all.\\nbut it doesn\\'t have a cd unit, anyway the other thing is that the laptop does not have an ethernet port for cable connecting.\\njust wifi....\\nthe screen is big, and everything was as described\\nFor everyday use, you can\\'t really go wrong with this laptop.\\nIf, like me, you will be paying bills, occasionally reading the news, or just buying stuff on line, Then this is a winner.\\nIf you are a gamer or need it for heavy computer use, get something else.\\nIt\\'s a good starter computer that is extremely light on the wallet.\\nLike i said, Good for basic stuff and as a starter.\\nStill getting use to Window 8.\\nHas a built in camera which i do not use.\\nSturdy but only for typical wear and tear.\\nCan not believe the price!\\nAmazing computer,  perfect for school.\\nI\\'ve had my Lenovo for a little over a month now and it does everything i want it to do and more.\\ni really have nothing negative to say about it.\\nThe keyboard is a little wonky with having to use the Function button to get the F-keys but with how infrequently i use those it is a non-issue.\\nit is a great value for what you get.\\ni can run somewhat modern games like Skyrim and Fallout New Vegas with no issues.\\nI get giddy every time I use this thing.\\nIt is a thing of beauty and fast enough.\\nWhen you click and don\\'t wait.\\nSo yes, it is ridiculously fast.\\nThe battery will get you from LA to NY no problem.\\nTHE 8.1.WAY DIFFERENT THAN MY OTHER COMPUTER SO WE HAVE TO GET USE  TO IT.\\nIT IS VERY LIGHT AND THE PICTURE IS NICE  AND THE PRICE WAS AMAZING.\\nCAN EVEN READMY KINDLE ON THIS COMPUTER\\nexcellent item, shipped on time, met my expectations, it doesnt heat at all, dont use it for gaming\\nfor the price this is a super product out of the box.\\nIt wont wow you with its speed but who can complain at $249.\\nplus this computer comes with a full size keyboard.\\nNO junkware!!\\nThis computer is great for someone who is looking to manage their online life(banling, facebook

starts\\nTerribly slow...\\nStart up time took forever everything runs very slowly.\\nScreen broke 1 month outside warranty.\\nOverall build quality is cheap.\\nAvoid Acer.\\nNot bad.\\nNice and light, seems to help your work instead of becoming work itself.\\nPerfect size for me.\\nProbably not a gaming machine, which I have zero interest in.\\ni just love this ultrabook\\ni defenitly recommend it for anyone for office and home work\\nIt\\'s ok.\\nI find that it often gets very slow and I have to restart more than usual.\\nIt\\'s light and easy to use, though.\\nI love this computer, this is my first ever Mac (I\\'m 21) and it took a little while to switch over from the OS I was used to, but it was a fast learning curve.\\nThe resolution is gorgeous, the computer is

.\\nslow processor, just not it\\nI can\\'t use the Trackpad very well, it\\'s too sensitive, so I hooked up a mouse.\\nExternal monitor worked easily.\\nBeen using Lenovo ThinkPad Edge laptops in our business for several years now and have no complaints about any of them.\\nThey have held up well not just in our sales department, but also in our service department where they are exposed to dust, exhaust, grease, oil, and all manner of other non-computer-friendly substances.\\nGENERAL, a quality laptop.\\nThe Lenovo software that comes preinstalled may qualify as bloatware but is easily removed if you\\'re not interested in it.\\nWindows 7 rocks.\\nComputer runs very slow!\\nGreat Laptop!\\nBigger screen than expected, laptop with a desktop design that is really nice to use for all types of usage, including programming/editing\\nOne of the very few laptops still available with Win 7 Pro, multiple USB ports, and a DVD read/write drive.\\nOnly drawback is no LED to show when the hard drive is being accessed.\\nNot a necessity, but something I\\'ve come to expect.\\nDoes what I need it to do and the price was right!\\nGreat laptop from Apple!\\nApple is unrivaled in terms of build quality and functionality.\\nThe retina screen is absolutely beautiful and the touchpad is the best touchpad to date.\\nThe pair allow for seamless navigation throughout the whole interface.\\nBattery life is astonishing given the processing power and high resolution display.\\nI can easily get 10 hours out of a full charge.\\nOverall, a high quality laptop and a great value considering all this computer has to offer.\\nWell worth the extra cost.\\nSize is perfect and display is beautiful!\\nExcellent performance, especially given its price point.\\nThe screen is wide and provides excellent clarity.\\nIt is not a small, compact laptop, but I won\\'t be traveling via air often, so its size and weight is not a problem for me.\\nI can appreciate why she recommended it!\\nDon\\'t expect much in terms of performance from this laptop.\\nIt gets the job done in terms of having a computer that can browse the web, use Word/Excel, and the like.\\nThis laptop does NOT have an RJ-45 Ethernet adapter for wired network connection.\\nfast easy\\nSo far I do not have any trouble with it other than the picture quality is a bit poor.\\nI have had it over a month now and it works just fine.\\nThis laptop suits my needs: as i am currently studying online and just need a computer for that purpose.\\nMy daughter uses it for college too and it works great for both of us.\\nSo i gave this 4 stars but only because of the poor picture quality, other than that it is a great buy!\\nThis laptop is absolutely horrible.\\nI bought it simply for Excel on Windows for work since I have a Macbook Air and literally the thing freezes and lags opening Excel or my web browser.\\nThere is a chance mine is defective but regardless I\\'m not going to try another one this is a terrible product.\\nI\\'d much rather bite the bullet and spend a little more for a product that actually meets minimum computing expectations for 2014.\\nI appreciate the effort to hit affordable pricing Dell but just not worth it.\\nIt is slow and complicated and very disappointing\\nGreat labtop..\\nnot as fast as I would have liked it to be but everything else is great!\\nI\\'ve only had

but over all. im very satisfied.\\nits very fast and very light.\\ngreat product.\\ni am giviing it four stars instead of five because of no disk drive and the crashing\\nI absolutely love my Dell Inspiron!\\nIt powers on/off very quickly, and it loads up automatically.\\nThe mouse click is a bit loud, but it really isn\\'t a problem.\\nFor $250, I highly recommend!!\\nvery poor quality lap top....\\nI am returning it...\\nSlow\\nGREAT value laptop!\\nI can\\'t believe this was just $250\\nSpeed is great, easy to set up and get going.\\nVery pleased so far.\\nIt is very difficult to use this computer.\\nToo many steps to get anywhere and hard to set up\\nThis things run smoothly for its price, and the battery life seems to go on forever.\\nI wasn\\'t disappointed in its performance.\\nAll in all, it\\'s well worth its price tag.\\nGreat laptop for the price.\\nIt was nearly impossible to find a laptop that had A) a side keyboard.\\nB) a DVD/CD player.\\nC) a large hard drive instead of using the Cloud\\nD) was under $300 with shipping.\\nThe only con is Windows effin 8.\\nStill giving it a 5 star rating because it is fast and a nice sized screen.\\nGreat for web design and general work.\\nOverall good but processing power isn\\'t very good.\\nW7 Pro with W8 pro upgrade is nice, but it frequently freezes for a few seconds here and there.\\nI replaced stock drive with WD Black 7K drive and is still quite slow.\\nBattery doesn\\'t last long web browsing (2.5 hours maybe).\\nIt has some bloat wear that I wish weren\\'t there.\\nIt works fine for a PC in this price range.\\nI bought it for my parents (late 60s) and they love it - particularly the keyboard and screen.\\nTerrific value for the money.\\nLove the key layout and the built-in mouse pad - all work well and are properly sized.\\nHighly recommended.\\nworks good but doesn\\'t seem like it\\'s made sturdy.\\nkinda to light and plastic feeling.\\nKiller computer.\\nI would highly recommend this computer it is FAST!!!\\nDoesn\\'t have touch screen but I have a tablet so that wasn\\'t so important.\\nLook and feel is good.\\nI am experiencing the system little slower than what I have expected.\\nAnd processor feels pressured even though I run medium scale programs, watching the way exhaust speed increases.\\nThe hdd has a scratching noise.\\nThe system sometimes lags a lot.\\nI don\\'t like it at all...\\nI can\\'t put a protector to make presentation...\\nA good value on a quality product.\\nEasy setup, and delivers all the functions we need.\\nThis laptop is amazing!\\nDespite the fact that there\\'s no optical drive, everything is perfect.\\nThe screen resolution is crystal clear, the speakers are amazing, and the track pad is easy to use.\\nThe home page/startup is easy to navigate which is the one thing I was mainly concerned about.\\nInternet is fast and reliable, battery life lasts a long time.\\nI love this laptop!\\nLOOKS LIKE THIS DELL IS A PIECE OF CRAP.\\nIT DOES NOT TURN ON - IF I TAKE THE BATTERY OUT IT MIGHT WORK, NOT SURE IF IT\\'S A BAD BATTERY OR COMPUTER!\\nDO NOT RECOMMEND!\\nAwesome laptop!\\nBootup time is amazing, battery life is decent and it has a great slim form factor.\\nThere is somewhat of a learning curve, but the operating system, and hardware of this Mac are great.\\nMore than enough for my use.\\nThe display is vibrant and clear, the keyboard is well designed and pleasant to type on;\\nI even installed a windows partition to be able to run Windows software.\\nThings just work, they are fluid, easy to use and understand, fast and work well.\\nThis computer is absolutely perfect for web browsing, watching video, word processing, and that\\'s about it.\\nIf you want a computer that plays games or any advanced tasks like editing video, this computer is NOT for you.\\nNow when I say don\\'t expect to play games on it, I mean it.\\nPretty much every major game save for Solitare won\\'t even play on it due to the slower processor.\\nIts also worth noting that there no bluetooth, no mircophone jack, no ethernet, no dvd/cd drive/burner, and no usb 3.0 ports.\\nIt DOES come with two usb 2.0 ports, a hdmi port, and a webcam.\\nThe webcam is nothing special, its there if you need it.\\nDon\\'t expect it to take good pictures or video.\\nThe battery is pretty soild.\\nIt lasts up to 5-6 hours with normal use.\\nThe computer itself runs very quiet and is mostly cool to the touch.\\nThe only major negative to me is Windows 8.1 (though YMMV) and the Dell crapware installed.\\nNot bad for the price.\\nI needed an inexpensive laptop to do basic office work on that was lightweight and this fits the bill just fine.\\nPerformance wise, it\\'s a bit slow, but that\\'s to be expected from a Celeron-class processor.\\nI\\'m also not a fan of Windows 8, but fortunately I can install whatever I want on the laptop without issue.\\nLove everything about this laptop!\\nSound, quality and touchscreen are awesome!\\nI would definitely recommend this!!\\nI love this laptop to the moon.\\nMy favorite colors black and red, the matte material and the red backlight of the keyboard.\\nThe sound is great and it\\'s fast.\\nThe laptop is beautiful, not extremely light but thin enough and wide screen with a full keyboard.\\nThe touch screen response is fast and it picks up bluetooth and wifi FAST.\\nMicrosoft Office is a 30 day trial, a number of games and apps are already preloaded.\\nIt\\'s exactly like the picture and I AM SATISFIED.\\nGreat laptop light and very versatile\\nit was easy to set up.\\nI like the number pad for work so that\\'s nice\\nThis is going to be random and unorganized, but here are my thoughts on the laptop:So far so good after a month.\\nIt took some getting used to on the Widows 8.1, after being an XP user for many years.\\nEverything seems to be running smoothly.\\nOnly downfall is the preloaded McAfee and other software.\\nThey are fine while the free subscription is going, but a pain when they start asking you to spend money every time you login.\\nDevice is light weight, quiet during operation and produces little to no heat.\\nIt has a quick start up and shut down time.\\nThe display is good quality.\\nJust wish there were more USB ports.\\nI AM IMPRESSED WITH THIS COMPUTER, INEXPENSIVE BUT QUALITY.\\nLOVE THE SIZE, I AM USING THIS FOR WORK, I AM A NURSE AND HAVE TO CHART DAILY, THIS IS EASY TO USE AND I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT.\\nIt\\'s so damn good I bought 2 :D\\nIf you\\'re the type of person that just likes to browse the Internet and enjoy media and do light work with Microsoft office, this is the laptop for you.\\nDon\\'t expect it to be a champion performer so if you want to play games or whatever this is not the computer for you.\\nIt\\'s extremely light weight and slim because of the lack of an optical drive (who uses those anymore anyways) so it easily fits into any college students bag.\\nI would recommend this to anyone who doesn\\'t need much out of a computer.\\nI am very happy with this computer.\\nIt is exactly what I expected, and the price is excellent!\\nYou are getting what you pay for and in my opinion, it is worth more.\\nBeen using it for about 4 hours now and it seems plenty fast and does everything I need it to do.\\nIts a very basic laptop.\\nI thought it would have a CD-rom drive, but there isnt one.\\nAlso wish it had a port to plug an internet cord into it because sometimes my wifi router likes to not work.\\nBut for the price its good.\\nOther than the slow CPU it works great for everyday use.\\nHeavy gaming is definitely not it\\'s strong point.\\nThe cover is a soft rubber texture without the friction.\\nSlick design and looks great.\\nThe machine is easy to use, has the power it needs for personal use and some light professional work.\\nIt could be lighter, but couldn\\'t everything.\\nThe battery seems adequate for most uses ~ 4.5 hour use/charge.\\nScreen is clear and bright.\\nGlad it has the DVD drive.\\nPerfectly adequate.\\nGreat PC.\\nThe i7 is incredibly fast, the RAM makes it proper for several games (not on maximum quality).\\nGreat sound quality too.\\nNice laptop.\\nI use it for school, its quick and has everything I need on it.\\nGood battery life as well.\\nWifi card not working right out of the box.\\nDealing with HP support is a ridiculous and painful experience.\\nI have spent more than 2.5 hours on the phone with them (over 4 different calls), only to get no where.\\nNow I\\'m looking into the return process, which I\\'m sure will just be loads of fun, if my prior experience is any indication.\\nSeriously, save yourself the hassle and purchase from a different company.\\nUsed to love HP products, but this has soured me on the whole company.\\nBy far the best laptop I\\'ve ever had.\\nIts fast, powerful, screen display is top notch and the battery life is excellent for a laptop of this size.\\nMy only concern is that since the battery is not external, I will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time.\\nI wonder if thats just Apples way of saying its time to get the newest and greatest laptop 3-4 years from now lol.\\nThe product is average and works well.\\nWorks at a decent speed.\\nThe mouse pad however is very loud which is why i gave it four stars.\\nI had a great experience purchasing my Dell Inspiron i3531-1200BK 15.6-Inch Laptop.\\nMy laptop was easy to set-up, and I\\'ve had no problems to date.\\nDid not disappoint me at all.\\nLenovo is the best laptop.\\nBuilt in mike is really poor and unusable for Skype or any other purpose.\\nAnd the only microphone input is for a combo Mike/Speaker plug.\\nSo to communicate I need to wear ear plugs or a headset with a built-in mike.\\nThat\\'s a nuisance for family Skype calls...only one can speak at a time.\\nWe haven\\'t used it enough or had it long enough to give it 5 stars, but so far it has been a very good laptop.\\nSeveral other reviewers made comments on the keyboard and now I can understand why --- this keyboard is the nicest to use of any laptop we\\'ve ever owned.\\nI\\'m a life-long desktop computer user, and the keyboard on this laptop is as close to a \"normal\" keyboard as I\\'ve ever seen.\\nWe like this new laptop -- a lot!\\nVery good performer for the price.\\nNot blazing fast, but quick enough.\\nOne really nice thing about Lenovo laptops is that they are not cluttered with a bunch or trial software.\\nThe desktop was clean once I got it up and running.\\nBattery life is above average, and it charges quickly.\\nKeyboard is sturdy.\\nThe touch pad takes a little getting used to as the \"click\" buttons are on top instead of the bottom.\\nI will be considering Lenovo for all future laptop purchases.\\nThis lap top is good so far.\\nIt is quiet runs smoothly.\\nI really like the video option on it, I stream movies on Amazon Prime and Netflix and there is no lag.\\nThe only negative would be that it gets pretty warm sitting on my lap for very long, but that is pretty much standard for all lop tops I think.\\nit stopped working 31 days after purchase.\\nit was slow and might be problematic.\\ni would shop around for a better one.\\nCRASHED only 2 days from getting it!!!!\\nSays it is failing hard drive.\\nI should have bought something better.\\nThe PC is works well with a good battery and a power cable, and has a web cam.\\nHowever, it does not have a DVD drive, neither does it afford one the opportunity to connect an external DVD drive as the manufacturer did not make any point ofconnection of an external drive.\\nOther than a hate of windows 8, she just loves it.\\nThe plastic materials are rather cheap.\\nLOVE IT!\\nNEEDS MORE INSTRUCTIONS WITH IT\\nI\\'m very happy with my Acer, it does just for what I need it.\\nEven the sound is fantastic\\nI love this laptop.\\nEven my extremely tech savvy boyfriend was impressed with the features and sleek design.\\nAlthough I\\'ve had it for less than a week, I am very satisfied.\\nFunctions well.\\nDoes all that was advertised.\\nIf it had a 4,5 star option, that is what I would give.\\nThe build is perfect, the screen fantastic, but I do have a bit of a problem with the fact that I have to buy adaptors for nearly everything, from vga cables to ethernet cables, so, almost perfect...\\n1.Great display.\\nLove the color accuracy.\\n2.Very decent speakers.\\n3.Fairly fast.\\n4.Loud fan when watching 4K video off YouTube.\\nSounds like a washer.\\nMachine gets fairly hot near the bottom of the screen.\\nBattery power laptop had difficulties computing.\\n6.Still feels too heavy to me.\\nCould lose another pound or two.\\n7.Expensive.\\nPaid close to $2800 out the door.\\nBiggest piece of junk I have ever purchased.\\nThis clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered.\\nIt would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for 5 minutes.\\nThe second one, after a little over a month, refused to turn on even with a full charge.\\nWhat a lemon!!\\nThis is a big disappointment.\\nI only use a laptop for personal use, but this one can\\'t even handle that!\\nIt takes a long time to load any page.\\nI\\'ve had it for a minth and so far it\\'s shut down completely 3 times.\\nI have had Dell Desktops for years, so had no qualms about buying a Dell laptop.\\nNever again.\\nI\\'ve always sworn by dell.\\nSo with this new order, all the upgrades and windows 8 really caught my eye and I got this for the long haul.\\nI am not ultra tech savvy but I can tell when it works slow!\\nI barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load.\\nI\\'m so disappointed.\\nIn two months, both the power cord pin broke (the company replaced it) and then the CD drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into a million pieces.\\nIn addition, no matter what I do to change the settings, add/delete Flash, etc., Firefox hangs on start-up.\\nIt seems like Lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on.\\nThe cords always feel like they are in my way.\\nOne positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard, which is larger than usual.\\nIt\\'s a pleasure to type on.\\nMy final thoughts: if you are a Mac user, stay away.\\nIf you want to travel with this laptop, don\\'t buy it.\\nIt\\'s clunky, heavy, and a pain to start up and shut down.\\nGreat for games\\nIt\\'s truly a great laptop for the price.\\nHowever, this laptop far exceeded my expectations when I bought it for college, I only use Malwarebytes and Microsoft Security Essentials, run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years.\\nFor $250, which is as much as my graphics card alone cost, this laptop is an incredible value.\\nIt is quite impressive at multitasking, which really surprised me.\\nI can have tabs open while playing YouTube videos and it handles it impressively well.\\nBUT I should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen, it\\'s certainly good enough for the average person, but if you\\'re used to good screens this may bother you a bit, but it\\'s certainly not unbearable by anyone\\'s standards.\\nIf you want to game, this thing can handle League of Legends on medium-low settings, but I certainly wouldn\\'t recommend it for gaming.\\nOverall, a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web-browsing.\\nWould definitely recommend for those who are \"technologically ignorant\"\\nthis computer is very slow\\nI love this laptop!\\nIt does everything I need it too!\\nVery good price.\\nVery nice computer\\nImmediately didn\\'t like the track buttons.\\nThey are loud and clunky but I figured I\\'d get used to it.\\nThe laptop died two days after I received it.\\nI purchased a  Dell Inspiron I3531-1200BK and so far I love it, this model has a true life monitor, which is worth the extra bucks.\\nIf you\\'re looking for a basic PC this is the way to go.\\nThe hinges on this PC are nice and tight and well made like the rest of the PC.\\nI was surprised  at  the overall quality and the price\\nIn all my life i have never come across a computer as slow as this one, it cant perform basic operations and is practically useless.\\nI just received the laptop and if it runs like this already cant imagine how it would work in the next couple of weeks.\\nIt took almost 20 minutes to boot up.\\nPlease people dont make the same mistake i did.\\nThis is a complete waste of money, dont let the price fool you!\\nWould be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly.\\nIt was not responsive at all to touch.\\nAnd while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work, your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse.\\nIf they can fix this, I think it would be a very nice, cost-effective laptop.\\nThis laptop broke within the first hour of use.\\nThe \\'A\\' key became jammed so that sometimes it wouldn\\'t press in.\\nDell claims they test each key with thousands of mechanical key strokes.\\nAlso, after restarting the laptop it constantly made high pitched electronic noises.\\nI\\'m sure I just got a bad egg, but instead of getting a replacement I decided to try a different one.\\nThis laptop is nice.\\nIt has a decent feel to it, sharp display and is fast enough.\\nThe biggest problem I have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive.\\nI have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available, but nothing has helped.\\nAlso, the touchpad is almost \\'sticky\\', which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad.\\nI would love to keep this laptop, but will be sending it back and looking for a different brand.\\nNo Lenovo for me.\\nInitially I liked the product so much.\\nAlthough it was slow but I felt it was ok for the price you have bought it.\\nBut now I am having battery problems.\\nLaptop automatically shuts down when battery life reaches 30%.\\nI am not satisfied with the product.\\nIt\\'s an amazing laptop.\\nMost of the things about the laptop is awesome except the touchpad.\\nThe laptop is fast.\\nThe Windows 8.1 used to boot in just 2s and that was freaking awesome.\\nNow I have dual booted my laptop to Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 and it\\'s not got too slow either.\\nI am loving it completely.\\nIt does make a little noise but that\\'s alright as it\\'s not too much.\\nIt doesn\\'t get heated up much even after continuous usage.\\nBut the  touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever I am typing, my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it\\'s really annoying.\\nI prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad, i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else.\\nA smaller touchpad would make life easier for Computer Science students or IT people much more easier.\\nUhhhhhh, the computer looks good.\\nBut, it works really slowwwwww!!!\\nIt has got me feel like to take years to successfully open a web page.\\nPurchased it for my birthday and love it!\\nI\\'m so glad that I have.\\nIt\\'s been a very easy transition moving my Windows created files over to the Mac.\\nSo far I haven\\'t lost any quality or information.\\nI have a little bit of a learning curve with the keyboard shortcuts.\\nBut other than that, I really am loving the quality and speed.\\nExpensive but worth it.\\nThe display has a great resolution but have difficulty always seeing the small print.\\nHaven\\'t quite figured out how to make the font size larger overall.\\nThis is without a doubt the worst laptop I\\'ve ever had.\\nAnd of course, the return window closed last week so now, I\\'m stuck with it.\\nI will never buy another Lenovo anything!\\nUnless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop, don\\'t buy this.\\nThe touchpad hasn\\'t worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning, I thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads I\\'ve worked with have some inherent oddities.\\nThis one however, is now very loose and I have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work, Then suddenly, I can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own.\\nToday, it hasn\\'t worked at all more than it has.\\nIt hangs, freezes and just isn\\'t working properly.\\nI have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open!\\nThough I don\\'t have much installed, I only have 96 of the 278G left!\\nI have no idea what\\'s taking up all the room, it doesn\\'t make sense.\\nI could go on and on, but suffice it to say, if you want to spend $400+ on a laptop, don\\'t buy this one!\\nIt\\'s definitely not worth the money.\\nVery fast and good for most steam games.\\nDon\\'t expect great graphics, though.\\nThe keyboard and sound are great, and the matte screen works well.\\nCan run CS:GO at 60 fps on low settings.\\nComputer was DOA.\\nTurned it on and it was beeping.\\nI love this laptop.\\nLooks good , well built, and very good speed.\\nNeeded a 2 usb adapt. for network plug, no problem.\\nKeyboard is nice and windows 8.1 is great, worried about that coming from xp.\\nPrice makes this the laptop I was looking for.\\nSo far I am very happy with this computer.\\nIt has everything I wanted-- built in Wi-Fi connectibility, a slot for my SD camera memory card, a DVD burner, big beautiful screen, plenty of USB ports (three 3.0 and one 2.0), and a keyboard with a nice touch.\\nI liked the fact that it came with Windows 7, but also included Windows 8 to install later if I need it.\\nThe price was good.\\nI use a wireless mouse, but the touch pad and the \"red button\" in the middle that works like a little \"joystick\" also work fine.\\nI wish I had bought this sooner!\\nThis is a great bargain.\\nYes, it\\'s running and old type processor so, hey, don\\'t even try gaming on it.\\nBut, if you are just an average user, it works really great.\\nThe screen is good, the whole things is very light and doesn\\'t run hot.\\nI\\'m very happy with it, typing on it right now and it is fast enough for that!\\nI like everything about this laptop.\\nIt has no way of connecting to the internet save wifi but that\\'s all I use anyway!\\nI put that free app on for word processing and it works like a charm.\\nI plugged it into my existing printers and it just worked, no fuss no muss.\\nIt immediately recognized the printer and was ready to go.\\nExcellent buy.\\nThe worst computer I have ever laid my eyes upon.\\nFirstly, it has no leds to let you know what is going on, no cap lock, no hard drive indicator, nothing.\\nOk, one light to let you know if the damn thing is on.\\nThe biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it, even when the strength bar is filled.\\nAlso, when you try to download a large file, like a video, it will start out normally, downloading at around 600kb/sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around 20kb/sec, making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless.\\nToo often I would find it not being able to stay connected to the internet.\\nI was unable to download iTunes to it.\\nDell support was awful to deal with.\\nAnd the settings are simply annoying.\\nJust not for me.\\nThe computer is as expected, and worth the money.\\nThe 8.1 windows is a major disappointment.\\nOperating a non touch screen on this system is a royal pain!\\nIt came with no instruction book - no back up CD\\'s and has already crashed.\\nHands down one of my best and most used purchases thus far.\\nThe Mid-2014 MacBook Pro does no disappoint...\\nRetina screen, solid build quality, weight, fast processor and the reliability of the Apple brand.\\nCons:Honestly zero con\\'s ... as a Windows PC user the switch over was seamlessly,  I run Parallel when I need Windows.\\nAll my devices work flawlessly.\\nI\\'m an amature, so this does more than I can handle.\\nI\\'m perfectly satisfied, just have to get use to the new 6.1 system I can\\'t see a problem.\\nI\\' doi9ng fine now, and happy as a bug.\\nThe price is great and it does everything I want to do,  Thanks.\\nIt\\'s perfect!\\nIt\\'s great for what he uses it for.\\nI am really not happy with this computer...\\nI don\\'t like WINDOWS 8 but that is no fault of the computer but the keyboard is so hard to get the keys to work and the space bar.\\nWould not buy it again.\\nMeh...but cheap.\\nThe first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus.\\nNow the graphics are not HD...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic (medium low grade) plastic.\\nSo if you don\\'t have kids, or not in high school or don\\'t accidently sit on it, it should be fine.\\nNow the speed is disappointing.\\nStart up is fine  maybe 20 secs at most, but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times.\\nEven for a 4GB RAM it barely chugs with 3 tabs open.\\nAll in all I wish I had waited a bit.\\nThis laptop is amazing!\\nWindows 8.1 has its pros and cons.\\nThe keyboard is backlit but you have to press the F5 key to turn it on.\\nOf course this will decrease your battery life.\\nThe sound is very nice and crisp.\\nAlso, I have no regrets about going with the 8GB RAM because its super fast.\\nI\\'m still exploring the various features but overall I am satisfied with my purchase.\\nThe HP Envy 15 has been everything I expected.\\nAfter doing much research for a laptop that had all the features I was looking for, This one hit all the criteria I had.\\nThe laptop is very responsice with the Core i7 processor and 8GB of RAM and the sound out of the Beats audio is great.\\nI would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a top performing laptop.\\nused 6 times black screen returned for refund\\ndo not use the facial recognition\\nWindows 8 is not supported by a lot of things!\\nThe Dell is quick enough, sturdy, not good with finger prints.\\nIt does what it advertises.\\nPrice is great, wish it didn\\'t have Windows 8, but that is an opinion.\\nI would recommend it, for anybody needing a reliable simple laptop.\\nI bought this for my daughter to use for school and homework, it\\'s not a \"fast\" computer, but it\\'s great for what she needs it for and very light weight!\\nLove the price too!\\nWell, my first apple computer and I am impressed.\\nWorks well, fast and no reboots.\\nGlad I did so far.\\ns....

I\\'m lost for words.\\nThis is the best switch I have ever done.\\nThis has much more memory and ram memory.\\nEven the battery life is like WOW!\\nI love, LOVE, LOOOOVE!\\nI can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied.\\nIt contains a long battery life, incredible specs, and an overall enjoyable performance.\\nUpgrading from a toshiba laptop, I am fully impressed with all of the benefits that the mac operating system provides.\\nThe snappy processor allows for me to quickly upload photos and videos, as well as create movies for me and my colleagues to enjoy.\\nIn upgrading to this computer I can say I have found little to any flaws in the product, hence the 5 star review.\\nLove this computer.\\nIt has done everything and more that I expected.\\nI am sure it will be able to do all I need it to do in the future as well.\\nThe screen looks great in my opinion the sound is nice.\\nSo far I have no complaints and dont expect many complaints in the future.\\nThis did give some set trouble and i had to call tech support.\\nThey were great.\\nits been easy breezy since then.\\nhow could you not love a Mac\\nso far so good, i have not encountered any issues with this computer.\\nlove the flip feature and the touch screen feature.\\nfor the price that i paid i feel that i got good value.\\nthis lap top is not the lightest you can purchase, so if that is important to you maybe you should shop some more.\\nTo a prospective buyer,  08/10/2012  Once you go Mac, you\\'ll never go back.\\nWas the best decision we ever made.\\nIt runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems!\\nWe don\\'t have to de-frag, deliete cookies, run security programs, or any of the common PC problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed.\\nYou can\\'t get a virus on Mac, so in the long run the cost of the Mac is saved by not buying security, and not having to replace your computer every year or two.\\nNever had any issues, no frustrations just great easy wireless, all in one fun!\\nIt\\'s great.\\nbecause it is a touch screen you don\\'t even need a mouse.\\nYou will probably never use it in tablet mode but it\\'s nice to know you have that option.\\nIf you draw on the other hand i\\'m sure you will love using this in tablet mode.\\nLastly, because it can flip 360 you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard.\\nThis computer is great.\\nI have a 250 GB SSD and 10 GB of RAM in it, which I installed myself.\\nIt runs faster than it did when I got it.\\nI enjoy the simplicity and user-friendly interface of Yosemite.\\nI\\'m excited for El Capitan.\\nThe apps are very easy to use.\\nThe resolution is excellent.\\nI am very satisfied with EVERYTHING about this machine.\\nLike so many others who do this there is a learning curve and I\\'m excited to do it.\\nThis MBP is clean, neat, and simple.\\nI like that.\\nIt takes less time to power up, and if you just close the case it go into sleep mode.\\nWHen you open it wakes up almost immediately.\\nVery nice.\\nI am pleased with my decision, however I have only had this for a few weeks.\\nThere are a few things I am dissappointed with though.\\nOnly 2 USB ports.\\nNo HDMI port.\\nThe headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone.\\nNot a big deal for me, but if you Skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a Mac.\\nAs a student majoring computer science, I really fell in love with this laptop.\\nIt\\'s 15.6 inches, which for me is not too big nor too small.\\nIt has the latest i7 CPU with a GTX 950M for GPU, which makes this laptop blazing fast (boots up in under 5 seconds, with the help of the SSD of course).\\n- It has 256GB SSD which is just enough for my OS, games, documents, and anything in between.\\nIt also has an extra bay for an extra HDD if you wish to add one.\\n- It\\'s not touchscreen!\\n- Its keyboard is nicely arranged, silent, and back-lit which is nice, but what I don\\'t like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers.\\nI have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good.\\n- This laptop is so silent, its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load, thanks to the 5th generation Intel core which draws less power,  thus less heat.\\n- It can run games really well.\\nWell, not really well.\\nMOBAs like Dota 2 and SMITE can be run on max quality settings with 60 fps or more.\\nMedium settings on titles like Tomb Raider for it to be acceptable (60 fps is the minimum acceptable fps #pcmasterrace).\\n- It\\'s lightweight and easy to carry around.\\n- The screen is a matte 1080p display, which is nice, but with poor viewing angle.\\nI find myself adjusting it regularly.\\n- It looks sleek and gorgeous.\\nBlends in with any accessory you use with it.\\nAll in all I am very happy with this purchase.\\nAnd with this price, I don\\'t think you can buy anything better.\\nAll I can say is I am impressed.\\nVery quick to get it up and running with a minimum setup time right after you open the box.\\nIt\\'s worth it.\\nPay me now, Pay me later.........I am happy with my choice going with this laptop.\\nI was disappointed.\\nIt seemed like a great computer and a great deal.\\nThe first one arrived and it did not work.\\nThe space bar sticks.\\nI find it hard to navigate from screen to screen.\\nFor a non-computer savvy person, it was very disappointing.\\nI like the 13 inch macbooks.\\nIts size is ideal and the weight is acceptable.\\nThe new Mac OS Mountain Lion has some nice features as wel as the trackpad.\\nI didn\\'t think i would need an optical drive but since i have had it I used it several times.\\nThe magnetic lid and charger is cool and battery indicator on the side is cool.\\nThe mac is light and so compact I thought I would regret not buying a retina display, not in the least The mac pro works just fine.\\nThe OS is easy, and offers all kinds of surprises.\\nI\\'ve been using Apple\\'s since 1992 and this is the fastest and best one I\\'ve  had.\\nThis Mac allows all of that.\\nThis is very fast, high performance computer.\\nThis should be more than  enough computer for almost everyone.\\nI would not hesitate recommending  this to anyone.\\nIt fast and easy to set up.\\nI had cloned my data from my old computer using  Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) and simply moved everything to the new computer  and was off and running at speeds I had only dreamed up before.\\nThe Mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized, lazy, and eye candy person in all of us.\\nThe MacBook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like a friendly guide.\\nIf you want to use the Internet, then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen, like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon.\\nThis computer is amazing for the individual who does not want to do any extra work via their understanding of their laptop.\\nI would\\'ve given 5 stars, had it not been for the hours of updates I\\'ve had to do to this upon arrival.\\nOther than that, I love it.\\nIt\\'s portable, reliable, and great for what I use it for.\\nPositives:  - No matter what position, this laptop will stay in it.\\nIt\\'s very sturdy.\\n- Quick boot-up, and runs efficiently.\\n- Touchscreen is great.\\nNegatives:  - As aforementioned, my only con was the updates.\\nEverything you\\'d expect from a Mac.\\nIt looks and feels solid, with a flawless finish.\\nThe screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down.\\nOnly had it a few weeks but doesn\\'t leave my side.\\nThis machine is flawless, fast, and classy.\\nOut of all the laptops I have owned, this is by far the best!\\nI\\'m not sure if it was covered in the description, but it does have a backlit keyboard and I\\'m getting about an 8 hour battery life on one charge (Except I don\\'t use this for games or videos, which obviously would drain the battery faster).\\nIt wakes in less than a second when I open the lid.\\nThe screen has an extremely high resolution that I\\'m very pleased with.\\nEven though MacBooks are expensive, you will see that they are well worth the money.\\nYou will not regret buying this computer!\\nMy daughter\\'s MacBook Air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago.\\nIt took 3 days to make an appointment at the local Apple store.\\nI\\'m not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand $129 for a new battery, $39 to replace it and $139 for a new keyboard.\\nI could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple store myself and asked for a manager.\\nHe explained to me the battery expansion is \\'normal\\'.\\nApple doesn\\'t cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care.\\nThe battery is simply considered \\'consumable\\' and NOT covered.\\nI asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook Air on the internet with the description that Apple doesn\\'t consider the product defective.\\nHis reply astonished me, looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said: \\'Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear!\\nHe didn\\'t specify who are \\'they\\' but from the tone of his voice and his 6\\'5\\' posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS.\\nHere is my take on all of this, the business model Apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from China, hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school, call them geniuses, and bully everybody who complains about their product.\\nSteve Jobs is dead, so is Apple.\\nNo more Apple devices in my household.\\nPlease Google \\'MacBook battery bulge explode\\' before you buy your next Apple toy.\\nI\\'ve been spoiled by the build quality and stability of Macintosh and even this used computer is a gem.\\nI can bat around all the things that everyone else says, but it\\'s been what we\\'ve been using for decades and I have nothing bad to say.\\nIt churns out HD content, runs without many flaws and I\\'ve yet to get a virus on a Mac since I started using the platform in the early 1990\\'s.\\nMy 15&amp;#34; MacBook\\'s motherboard fried but I think that was a sugar spill that I never bothered cleaning up.\\nThat\\'s the only issue I\\'ve ever had since working on Macs in 1995.\\nThat\\'s a pretty impressive track record don\\'t you think?\\nHowever, the HP Envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more.\\nI have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all.\\nWhile the price may seem high, it is worth every penny with its many perks.\\nThe Pros:  A Ton of Storage Space- This laptop comes with 8GB of memory and a 1 TB (1000GB) hard drive.\\nThat is plenty of space for your laptop, which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers.\\n2-in-1 Capability- The ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus.\\nIf you are looking to get a 2-in-1 laptop, this is the laptop you should consider.\\nI love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies, without having the keyboard in the way of things.\\nI find it much easier to type on and much more durable.\\nBattery Life- My battery life is really good with this laptop and I have had no problems with it thus far.\\nI can usually go about 10 hours before I get down to 10% battery life.\\nThe Cons:  No Disc Drive- Call me old fashioned, but I still enjoy listening to physical CDs and uploading them to iTunes.\\nHowever, I can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive.\\nOverall, I definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop.\\nThe touchscreen and 2-in-1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes.\\nIt also is nice to be able to play Candy Crush or Angry Birds when in between classes straight from your laptop.\\nIt makes it much more exciting to play!\\nI\\'m actually writing this review on my new MacBook and I love it!\\nThe computer it self is amazing.\\nIt is an older model, so know that upfront, but it is everything I was looking for.\\nFrom the moment I received this MacBook it was like a dream come true.\\nI know once I upgrade the ram to 8GB it will pick up a lot.\\nAlso, if after reading some reviews and doing some research I found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus.\\nSo long story short, if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop.\\nI know people were complaining that it isn\\'t the newest model, but it all depends on what you are looking for.\\nI highly recommend!!\\nThis computer is a fantastic tool for word processing, searching the internet, and keeping track of everyday life.\\nIt\\'s also incredibly light, has a battery that can last for days, and looks like a piece of art.\\nThough, that\\'s pretty much what your paying for -- a well designed device.\\nWhen you look at the internal specs, the computer is only worth about $500.\\nIt has a 128 GB storage capacity (but with the option of a 256 GB hard drive) and a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, so don\\'t expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too.\\nIf your looking to be a trendy hipster who can\\'t live without a Mac, it\\'s a great buy.\\nIt mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don\\'t need.\\nPros :  1. Nice Looks.\\n2. Keyboard is great\\nI wanted a simple Full HD display and this one does its job\\n4. Sound is great\\n5. And this has a extra slot for HDD\\n6. No CD drive.\\nCons:  1. Web cam.\\nVGA really ASUS??\\nYou don\\'t want to show this to anyone :).\\nAnyway I don\\'t use webcam much so , I don\\'t care\\n2. Viewing angles are not great.\\n3. Remember its a dual core.\\n4. The fan kicks in even its not too hot.\\n5. I found the track pad not great.\\nI use my mouse so not a problem for me.\\nOver all very good system and worth it.\\nThis was the ONLY tablet-style computer so far which met my requirements.\\nI was seduced by this computer, so I took it home.\\nThe wireless keyboard (not bluetooth, but RF) did not pair up with the device.\\nIt still did not pair.\\nI even ran it as Administrator -- still no effect.\\nI used the Ctrl-Esc keys while turning on, and still nothing.\\nIt flickers briefly to green before the light goes out.\\nI still can\\'t pair it.\\nI don\\'t want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional.\\nSony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while I get my money back for a DEFECTIVE product.\\nBut Sony doesn\\'t seem to have addressed it.\\nMy first Mac computer and as many before me I just fall in love with it.\\nChanged the memory from 4 GB to 8 GB Corsair Vengeance and 500 GB HDD (5400 rpm) with Seagate hybride 750 GB HDD+SSD.\\nMachine is flying and with parallels desktop 8 I have my old PC notebook completely functional on my MBP.\\nWay to go and enjoy both worlds.\\nThis ASUS you\\'re looking at right here, and that I\\'m typing on right now, has one.\\n-  With that being said, for the price ($800!), you get a nice fast laptop, but if you ask me, it\\'s missing some things that I feel should be automatically included:\\nThis laptop has no:  - Touchscreen  - Optical Drives (OK, a bit of a stretch, because that would eat up precious space in this monster)  - Swivel or detachable screen\\nWhat this laptop does have is:  - Windows 8, which is confusing as all get-out  - Tons of &amp;#34;bloatware&amp;#34;.\\nThis is really nice, but I HATE the awkward right mouse clicking.. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\\'t.. may be the laptop, may be the laptop in conjunction with Windows 8? \\nEither way, highly annoying.\\nI hooked up a USB mouse and all is well.\\nAll works beautifully but Windows 8 is taking a bit of getting used to.\\nLove the 360 degree rotation and the touch screen works great, but a little bit of a learning curve there too, as sometimes I have to tap a few times to get the exact location I need...\\noverall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop (the mouse was the only negative I could really see)...\\nThis is a fantastic transformer!\\nI loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows 8 platform.\\nThe only reason I returned it was because I bought it to use the touchscreen with photoshop and because of the program, it could not utilize the touchscreen within the work space except to zoom and rotate.\\nI would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase.\\nIt\\'s a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen.\\nI\\'m looking forward to needing a laptop update so I can purchase this computer again.\\nI\\'ve only had this for a week Overall I like the computer, it\\'s thin &amp; light and The wireless keyboard works great.\\nI was impressed; Sony puts in small touches like a USB charging port on the charger.\\nOne thing I did\\'t like is the stylus holder, it\\'s cheap plastic and doesn\\'t seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the USB port.\\nI do\\'t use it, I think I would accidently break it and loose my stylus.\\nThe other Issue I had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it.\\nAwesome laptop for college!!!\\nCan be used for gaming as well.\\nIt\\'s light, fast and has great battery!!\\nIt\\'s a steal when considering the specs and performance as well.\\nThe processor and GPU are fantastic at running games and multiple apps.\\nI can run most games to a good quality without seeing any lack of speed.\\nThe backlit keyboard is a nice touch especially.\\nMake sure to only handle this computer with clean hands because the front cover can get oily pretty fast.\\nI\\'m overall very pleased with my new laptop!!!\\nThe only downside are the speakers.\\nThey don\\'t go very loud at all.\\nThe quality of the sound is nice but the lack of volume really kills it for me.\\nThis is mostly not an issue since I mainly use earbuds anyways however it could be annoying at times.\\nThe screen looked fine to me and wasn\\'t an issue like others have been saying.\\nOverall great for me!!!\\nThis laptop has delivered.\\nI immediately did the Windows 10 upgrade and haven\\'t had any issues.\\nThe wireless adapter is strong and the SSD is fast.\\nThis thing boots in just a few seconds which is nice.\\nOthers have mentioned issues with viewing angle on the screen, but I never use the laptop where I\\'m not looking straight at it so it doesn\\'t bother me.\\nI\\'m very pleased with the purchase.\\nBoot time is super fast, around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute.\\nApps launch super fast, and the 500GB HDD is more than sufficient.\\nI usually use my Mac for school work and internet browsing, so the entry-level 13\\' MacBook Pro is already more than what I expected from a computer I would typically use it for.\\nMacs hardly ever get viruses, and they are completely incompatible with existing Microsoft Windows Viruses.\\nFurthermore, Mac OS X Mountain Lion\\'s Gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans, which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed.\\nThe keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit, which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing (Typing?).\\nOverall, the screen resolution, though non-retina, is sufficient for normal web browsing and work.\\nThe thunderbolt port is awesome!\\nUS 3.0 comes with the MBP and has transfer rates of up to 5gbps.\\nOther ports include FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, MagSafe port, Microphone jack.\\nSDHC card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs.\\nThe glass track pad is large enough for Apple\\'s highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers, zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers, accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers.\\nFor Windows users switching to a Mac, you can also enable right clicking (known to apple as secondary click) in the system preferences&gt; Mouse and enabling right clicking.\\nThe unique to apple aluminium uni-body is a real beauty.\\nIt makes the MBP very durable and protects it from scratches, though you shouldn\\'t go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it.\\nThe Mac app store and iTunes store are phenomenal.\\nThe Mac app store is your one-stop shop for Mac software, though you can also download software online at your own risk.\\nThere are currently around 10,000 apps on the App store (and counting...), and billions of songs available for download fro the iTunes store.\\niTunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it\\'s simple to use User Interface.\\nI\\'m sure you won\\'t regret making this purchase.\\nOne of the worst pieces of electronics I have ever bought.\\nVery pour performance.\\nIt takes for ever to wake it up.\\nSometimes It stops receiving wifi signal, so I have to restart it.\\nIt is very slow and not responsive.\\nWould not recommend.\\nGlare is also pretty frustrating.\\nThere is definitely more to say...\\nI tested it, it worked great.\\nHe received it, and one day later it DIES.\\nThe laptop refuses to start, we have troubleshooted all areas, still fails to start.\\nCannot even get to bios.\\nJust a click and a BLACK SCREEN.\\nOf course, it DIES 3 days past the return window.\\nWe got two days of operation from this laptop.\\nWhen the MacBook Pro arrived, I helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the PC to the Mac... an easy drag-and-drop process utilizing a flash drive.\\nIt was delivered with 4GB of RAM -- 2GB on each of two sticks -- which was probably adequate.\\nSo I simply pulled one 2GB stick from the machine and installed the 8GB stick in its place.\\nThe machine now has 10 gigs of RAM and it works just fine.\\nBut, hey, it\\'s an Apple.\\nI wouldn\\'t expect anything less!\\nIf it was possible to give them 0 start, I would have done it.\\nMy Laptop\\'s one of the Key from keyboard came out and it was mechanical failure.\\nMy laptop was under coverage but when I gave it to them for repairs, they quoted me $755 for it.\\nthis company just wants customers\\' money in their pocket.\\nthey dont care how you feel when they charge you hundreds of hard earned dollars.\\nI wish this company to go bust.\\nI will never ever buy any apple product in my life.\\nOverall I love it.\\nFirst, when I move the screen to put it in tablet position, the hinge doesn\\'t seem totally solid.\\nI feel like I need to be really gentle with it, but maybe that\\'s just me.\\nAlso, and this maybe is another personal quirk, but the keyboard sits a little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop.\\nFirst off, AMAZING LAPTOP!\\nThree years ago I had purchased this bad boy and it still runs great!\\nIf I were to have any technical difficulties, the local apple and contact line were able to help me asap, it was quite impressive.\\nI myself had purchased the 750 gig drive laptop and as a DJ with thousands of songs, pictures, and other things...and after 3 years I have managed to fill around 9% of my gigs.\\nThere is SO MUCH ROOM!\\nPros  1. Amazing storage (both 500gig and 750gig)\\n2. 8 gig ram needed if you are as productive as I am (DJ, photography, movie making, etc) its quick!\\n3. No anti spyware needed, never had a virus and I never will\\n4. build solid and durable\\n5. bought the 3 year warranty and boy it was needed (because of my doings)\\nCons.  1. If you fall behind in updates, your laptop will become progressively slower, just update it...then its back to normal\\n2. Sometimes when I stared mine up it would take a few extra minutes to boot on, other times it is a few seconds\\n3. Cannot manually take battery out, unless you work for apple or have the tools\\nOverall, it is a fantastic laptop.\\nMine has been though hundreds of parties, weddings, quinces, anything involving performances, it can take it!\\nThis laptop was made for art, music, beat-making, pictures, movies, graphic design.\\nBy the way, it comes with apps and hardware that can already support what I had just listed.\\nThis laptop will last you a half decade if not a full decade.\\nSoon I will be hitting the 5 year mark and I think this thing can make it another 5 in my opinion.\\nGet this now!!!\\nBy the way...I paid for this particular laptop roughly 2 grand...LOOK AT THE PRICE NOW!\\nThis is a great laptop.\\nI bought it for college and couldn\\'t be happier.\\nThe SSD and I7 complement each other really well.\\nI was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows 10, but it is pretty awesome.\\nIf you are looking for a light, durable, and extremely effecient laptop, buy this one!\\nThey really know what they are doing.\\nThe laptop is so easy to work with.\\nLike it was designed for what people would want to the system to do, very user-friendly.\\nIts simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great, aside from its quality design and sexy looks.\\nIf you dont like windows I would suggest trying a Mac.\\nThe investment is worth it.\\nHave bought several laptops in last several years and hands down this has been the best ever.\\nMac User interface is just the best.\\nAlso, the laptop is quite, no more burnt laps, best screen display, and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over.\\nOnly thing I dislike is that everything for Mac is expensive but I guess you pay for quality!\\nNot impressed with Macintosh products.\\nIn fact I am completely frustrated.\\nAlso, many software programs are not compatible with the IOS platform.\\nBe sure the programs you need will work on a MAC before you buy one!\\nI had heard people speak highly of the MacBook Pro for college students, and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use.\\nThe MacBook Pro is useful for college students for many reasons:\\nIt is the cheapest product in the line of MacBook\\'s\\nThe new operating system called Snow Leopard is installed and ready for use\\nThe battery life has increased from the last version from 4 hours to 7 hours, making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger.\\nReliability: Throughout the past few years, I have had no problems with the MacBook Pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws.\\nDurability: My computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it, but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it.\\nUsability: The MacBook Pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who doesn\\'t necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers.\\nThe processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly.\\nThe MacBook Pro has a significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes:\\nPros:  o It usually runs very smoothly, but Apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers.\\no It has an extended battery life.\\no It is extremely user friendly.\\nCons:  o Some people don\\'t enjoy the way the processing system runs, but don\\'t have any issues with getting it to function.\\no Others have problems with the applications depending what they need to use the device for, for example engineering majors need extra applications &amp; systems to do some work, but they are easily downloadable.\\nMy first laptop ever and it is a flips into a tablet mode also, brilliant.\\nSo far so good.\\nBattery doesn\\'t hold up to what it said in the description but I got it refurb\\'d and I imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price (Just a guess).\\nStill getting used to typing on it, my palms keep hitting the mousepad and causing the cursor to jump and moving me off of where I was typing.\\nPlenty of ports and since this is my first laptop, I really don\\'t have anything to compare it to.\\nNote: no DVD drive, no Ethernet port\\nScreen is too small to read and almost impossible to touch  with a normal adult finger.\\nThe brightest screen setting appeared dim in normal room light.\\nKeyboard is flimsy and mediocre at best.\\nThe touch pad feel is a 4 on scale  1 - 10.\\nComputer seemed sluggish for an Intel Core i5 device.\\nPower on - good luck finding it.\\nI would run back to computer store and return this expensive toy.\\nsigned: not impressed\\nI bought this a few months ago and it\\'s holding up fairly well.\\nRuns fast, the touch screen hasn\\'t lost any sensitivity, I\\'m overall very happy with it.\\nThis one doesn\\'t do that.\\nThe trackpad is pretty crappy - but aren\\'t they all?\\nThis is my first Apple computer and I couldn\\'t be more pleased.\\nIOS does everything its billed to do and much, much more.\\nLiterally every detail has been thought out and designed with the user in mind.\\nI can\\'t believe how much time it saves me through automatic processes.\\nThe computer of the people!\\nI love this laptop.\\nThe batter lasts as long as claimed.\\nI get about 5 or so hours playing the sims.\\nI haven\\'t really officially tested it yet, but it\\'s a long time.\\nI hate plugging my laptop in because I don\\'t want to leave it on too long and hurt the battery, but with this laptop I rarely have to charge it.\\nThe touchscreen is responsive and even works with my crappy dollar stylus.\\nThe only problem I have is with windows 8.\\nI hate windows 8.\\nIt made me sign up with Microsoft and sometimes won\\'t let me download things that are harmful to my computer, but that\\'s what anti virus software is for lol.\\nThe wifi rumor hasn\\'t happened to me.\\nThe wifi works great.\\nIt feels very well built.\\nThe metal is very expensive feeling.\\nThe laptop is a little more than an inch thick when closed.\\nI\\'m a very weak girl and I could lift this laptop with one hand, however I\\'d get tired soon lol.\\nThe 15.6&amp;#34; screen is not good for carrying around in your bare hands.\\nI bought my first MacBook exactly 5 months ago and was really happy with my new toy, but what was not my surprise when I turned it on 2 days ago and the screen was completely black.\\nI can hear the noise of the computer turning on and the lights also turn on but the screen in completely dead.\\nThe best computer I\\'ve ever bought.\\nThe simple look of icons and format makes it easy to navigate through programs and download files.\\nThe only issue I had was with the harddrive.\\nThe harddrive crashed and I thought I had lost the whole computer.\\nReplacing the harddrive in this laptop is extremely easy, a couple screws on the back to remove the backplate and the harddrive is pretty much plug and play.\\nAnd apple was happy to install the latest osx for free!\\nYou wont be disappointed with this computer!\\nIt\\'s just a matter of getting used to the touch-pad commands.\\nThankfully I have earphones and an external amplifier for audio; the onboard speakers are just terrible.\\nBut what should I expect from a unit that is this thin and this light?\\nThe most disappointing purchase of my life!\\nI received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after I purchased this horrible machine.\\nWithin the first few months that I bought it, there was clearly a problem with the hard drive.\\nThe online customer service was awful.\\nGave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile.\\nNo one would ever answer my question as to why I couldn\\'t get another new Macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my Macbook was still under warranty.\\nAs a matter of fact, no matter how many times I asked that question, the employees I spoke purposely ignored it.\\nThey didn\\'t say yes and they didn\\'t say no, they just pretended that I never asked it, which was incredibly frustrating.\\nI\\'ve been to the &amp;#34;genius&amp;#34; bar several times (they have been very nice).\\nThey have now basically replaced everything inside my machine, told me there was a problem with the hardware, so I now have a &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; machine.\\nMaybe I\\'m not being reasonable, but I don\\'t feel that\\'s the same as a new computer because I didn\\'t pay for a refurbished computer.\\nI still have weird freezing problems with it and it\\'s pretty slow, but it\\'s not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in.\\nI had delusions of grandeur regarding Apple\\'s &amp;#34;great customer service&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;reliability of their machines&amp;#34; etc.. etc...blah...blah...\\nI\\'m sure most people\\'s Macbooks work just fine, but FYI, if you get the factory dud, you\\'re stuck with it and no one at Apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away.\\nOne OS for this platform, no OEM OS paraphernalia and automatic updates.\\nI am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the MAC!\\nWell she was right, Whatever in the world took me so long to get a computer that just works.\\nI\\'m no power user, but I have had no learning curve with the MAC and I don\\'t do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the OS.\\nI did buy Office 2008 for the MAC at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for $64 and that was  a steal in my opinion.\\nOtherwise I am happily a  Mac user.\\nFor a premium laptop sold in 2013, the Apple MacBook Pro (13 inch, base model) is about as basic as it gets: no SSD, no discrete graphics, no 1080p display, and no touch screen.\\nBut Apple does not pretend it has any of these.\\nWhat it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side, Apple\\'s OSX Mountain Lion, the sleek looks Apple always delivers, reasonable specs, good battery life, nice keyboard, and excellent trackpad.\\nThose looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag, and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs.\\nThe MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac, but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution.\\nThis Mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair.\\nHard drives can be replaced, RAM can be added as needed, and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge.\\nThis, added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money, detracts from the computer\\'s value.\\nLowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase, but for the price, this is a four star (good) computer.\\nTLDR version: good, reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive.\\nI am really sorry I bought this machine.\\nI was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase.\\nThis machine has made me go there 5 times and has been nothing but a continuous problem.\\nFinally, they are sending it in for a motherboard replacement.\\n(It\\'s a lemon).\\nSo, I\\'m cooled on Mac buys.\\nThey did not replace the motherboard.\\nInstead they \\'tightened\\' a loose wire.\\nIt also has a big new scratch on the top cover.\\nI started it up and it still has the same problem I went in to fix.\\nSo I\\'m going back to Genius Bar for visit #6.\\nI think it may have to be \\'Apple Don\\'t Care\\' instead of Apple Care.\\nYou get what you pay for, right?\\nMac is complicated and frustrating at moments.\\nI watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough.\\nI should have known better.\\nI hope you don\\'t make the same mistake...\\nWhen I first got the computer, I noticed the tracking pad was hard to click.\\nI took my Macbook to the Apple store and they had to replace the battery after 1 month of use since it was swelling.\\nThey tried to tell me that the battery wasn\\'t covered by the warranty and it costs about $150 to replace.\\nThey ended up not charging me.\\nOther than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long, I\\'m pretty happy with the computer.\\nI\\'m a designer turned front-end developer and this computer is unusable for front-end development.\\nOpening photoshop takes FOooooooRRREVER, as do all programs that do not begin with an \\'i\\'.\\nThe free upgrade to Mountain Lion FAILED.\\nIt tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again.\\nBefore and after I resolved that issue, I saw the damn \\'beachball\\' all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell it\\'s doing while I wait for it.\\nI spend so much time waiting for it.\\nI can\\'t believe people like these computers.\\nNow that they are not virus free ([...]l) I see absolutely no benefit to Apple products as they are slower, more expensive, and do not last as long.\\nDon\\'t waste your money.\\nMy HP seemed great at first, then the problems started.....wireless adapter would just &quot;disappear&quot; and the system said it didn\\'t have a network card.\\nSometimes it comes back, sometimes not.\\nHP was NO help.\\nThe lettering wore off the keys, so you better be able to type blind.\\nThe battery lasted 12 months, then pffft.....gone.\\nWhen I had a boot up issue, the HP recovery didn\\'t work.\\nThe disks I made wouldn\\'t work.....HP support stated &quot;we\\'re a hardware company, not a software company.&quot;\\nThen there was a power cord recall....HP never notified us.....and we did register......never again.\\nI don\\'t have the inclination or time to devote to a companies tech support, search functions, or hold times.....dropped the HP and never looked back.\\nI gave this product 5 stars because I have been looking for a MacBook Pro for a long time and I found it here for a wonderful price.\\nI have used this product for only 2 days, but I can\\'t wait to use it more.\\nI really like Mac/Apple products because of their operating system.\\nI can tweet and use Facebook from the sidebar which is really nice.\\nI also like I have the option to push calendars, photos, and contacts to an iPad, iPod Touch, or iPhone (if I had any of those).\\nThe only thing I have had trouble with so far is transferring music to iTunes which I would have liked to do though &amp;#34;Home Sharing&amp;#34; (I used iTunes on a computer separate from my Linux computer) but I could not figure that out.\\nI just ended up using my iPod to transfer my iTunes music and I re-downloaded my Amazon music (losing my ratings).\\nI have not tried gaming on it but I have heard that Mac/Apple does not do games well.\\nI plan on using my MacBook Pro for a long time.\\nWhen I decided to buy my first computer, I wish I had bought a Mac first.\\nIf the price doesn\\'t deter you, you\\'ll find it well worth it in terms of trouble-free operation.\\nI\\'ve had it for more than a year, and I\\'ve found that no anti-virus software is needed, as long as you don\\'t download anything without being 100% sure that it\\'s from a legitimate source.\\nFrom time to time I get the \\'spinning beach ball\\' that holds up progress.\\nI can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the \\'Show all bookmarks\\' icon (the open book icon at the upper left).\\nOnce in a long while that doesn\\'t work; in that case I turn the computer off, then on again, and sign in -- problem solved.\\nI\\'ll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself, and just conclude by saying that I\\'m delighted with my purchase.\\nReceived this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed.\\nTo go left I have to go right and vice versa and to go up I have to go down.\\nWhen I attach a mouse it\\'s fine but the touchpad is really annoying.\\nI went through the settings and there isn\\'t a way to fix it.\\nIt\\'s a great laptop, but right now it\\'s annoying to use the touchpad.\\n'"

              "'Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place   but not any longer .\\nWe   there were four of us   arrived at noon  the place was empty  and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .\\nThey never brought us complimentary noodles   ignored repeated requests for sugar   and threw our dishes on the table .\\nThe food was lousy  too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .\\nAfter all that   they complained to me about the small tip .\\nAvoid this place  \\nI have eaten at Saul   many times   the food is always consistently   outrageously good .\\nSaul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .\\nThe duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .\\nThe wine list is interesting and has many good values .\\nFor the price   you can not eat this well in Manhattan .\\nI was very disappointed with this restaurant .\\nIve asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .\\nI had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested .\\nFood was okay   nothing great .\\nChow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family .\\nI/we will never go back to this place again .\\nWent on a 3 day oyster binge   with Fish bringing up the closing   and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended   because it was so great  \\nService was devine   oysters where a sensual as they come   and the price ca n t be beat  \\nYou ca n t go wrong here .\\nEvery time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street .\\nEverything is always cooked to perfection   the service is excellent   the decor cool and understated .\\nI had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible .\\nCa n t wait wait for my next visit .\\nI had my eyes on this place   promising myself I will one day ` give it a try .  \\nAnd I hate to say this but I doubt I  ll ever go back .\\nThe food is very average ... the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet   every thing they serve is too sweet here .\\nThe only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree .\\nI had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty LRB could  ve used a bit more salt RRB .\\nAnyways   if you  re in the neighborhood to eat good food   I would n t waste my time trying to find something   rather go across the street to Tamari .\\nThe decor is night tho ... but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite unappetizing   and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .\\nWe ate outside at Haru  s Sake bar because Haru  s restaurant next door was overflowing .\\nWhat  s the difference between the two  \\nTheir sake list was extensive   but we were looking for Purple Haze   which was n t listed but made for us upon request  \\nThe spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome   great appetizer to share  \\nWe went around 9 30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great  \\nwe love th pink pony .\\nTHe perfect spot .\\nFoodawesome .\\nService  friendly and attentive .\\nAmbiance  relaxed and stylish .\\nDo n t judge this place prima facie   you have to try it to believe it   a home away from home for the literate heart .\\ni have eaten here a handful of times   for no reason besides sheer convenience .\\nLRB i hang out   and live   in the neighborhood . RRB\\nthe food is decent .\\nhowever   it  s the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .\\ni happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of selfrespect   which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me   i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water   or the check .\\ni know   you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored   but my agenda is i  m here to eat and enjoy the company of friends   seeking a pleasant experience .\\nwell   i did n t find it there   and trust   i have told everyone i can think of about my experience .\\nthe last time i walked by it looked pretty empty   hmmm .\\nThis place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .\\nI had a great experience .\\nFood is great .\\nService is top notch .\\nI have been going back again and again .\\nI tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin   which was heavenly at sushi rose .\\nIt melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistencynot too fishy   creamy   and slightly buttery .\\nThe sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .\\nThe rice to fish ration was also good  they did n t try to overpack the rice .\\nWe took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .\\nI went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently .\\nShe lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy .\\nSurprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .\\nIn the evening   this place attracted a well dressed   with it   NY crowd .\\nThe food was well prepared and the service impecable .\\nI  m going back .\\nHaving hunted around for a quiet   romantic   yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot .\\nQuite simply it  s like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility .\\nThe service was attentive   yet unimposing   the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .\\nThe Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough LRB both in quantity AND quality RRB .\\nI will be going back and heartily recommend it  \\nI  ve had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times   when I have been in the neighborhood .\\nIt is terrific   as is the value .\\n$ 6 and there is much tasty food   all of it fresh and continually refilled .\\nI am not a vegetarian but   almost all the dishes were great .\\nFrankly   when you compare what you can have here for lunch   versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city   there is no comparison .\\nGo hungry and enjoy .\\nThe food here is rather good   but only if you like to wait for it .\\nI like the somosas   chai   and the chole   but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .\\nThe service varys from day to day  sometimes they  re very nice   and sometimes not .\\nThe kitchen however   is almost always slow .\\nAlso   specify if you like your food spicy  its rather bland if you do n t .\\nThe ambience is pretty and nice for conversation   so a casual lunch here would probably be best .\\nJust went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday .\\nIf you  ve ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .\\nAdd to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .\\nThe lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it .\\nOnce you step into Cosette   you  re miraculously in a small   offthebeaten path Parisian bistro .\\nThis tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets   with that certain Parisian flair .\\nThe food was average to aboveaverage ; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive   and the desserts not brilliant in any way .\\nHowever   go for the ambience   and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world  \\nI have never eaten in the restaurant   however   upon reading the reviews I got take out last week .\\nIT WAS HORRIBLE .\\nThe pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n t even fully melted  \\nIt looked like shredded cheese partly done  still in strips .\\nI have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst .\\nThis has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn .\\nThe pizza is overpriced and soggy .\\nYes   they use fancy ingredients   but even fancy ingredients do n t make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .\\nA big disappointment   all around .\\nI think I  ve had some the best meals of my life at minnow .\\nThe seafood is amazing   there  s a good wine list   and the everchanging menu always offers some great surprises .\\nThe combination of superfresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious .\\nWorth the trip from Manhattan .\\nWas there Friday night .\\nBest Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .\\nAnd I  ve been to many NYC delis .\\nMy wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .\\nPrice no more than a Jersey deli but way better .\\nAs a Japanese native   I  ve lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years   but I was just so amazed at this place .\\nThis place is the most Japanese it can ever get .\\nThe signs   the specials menus   food   and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese .\\nThis place is worth an onehour drive .\\nI am so coming back here again   as much as I can .\\nLeon is an East Village gem   casual but hip   with well prepared basic French bistro fare   good specials   a warm and lively atmosphere .\\nMy wife and I always enjoy the young   not always well trained but nevertheless friendly   staff   all of whom have a story .\\nSit outside in the warm weather ; inside for cozy winter .\\nDecent wine at reasonable prices .\\nHave been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience .\\nOur teenage kids love it   too .\\nEverytime I decide to try another place on the UES   I get angry that I did n t just go to Zucchero Pomodori .\\nThis is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood .\\nThe service is excellent   the decor is great   and the food is delicious and comes in large portions .\\nYou  ll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city   and most still do n t compare .\\nI  m partial to the Gnocchi .\\nThis place is incredibly tiny .\\nThey refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .\\nThe hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .\\nThe food was bland oily .\\nI just do n t understand all the hype ... .\\nWe went to Ino for Valentines .\\nWe have been to this place many times   and always have great food   wine   and service .\\nWe were worried we would have trouble getting in   but somehow managed to have a short wait .\\nAs always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .\\nWhen we sat   we got great and fast service .\\nThe people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .\\nMake sure you try this place as often as you can .\\nThis is a fun restaurant to go to .\\nThe pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere .\\nBut the pizza is way to expensive .\\nA large is $ 20   and toppings are about $ 3 each .\\nI went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read .\\nSauce was watery and the food did n t have much flavor .\\nIf you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants   this is not the place for you .\\nI do n t think I would go again .\\nThis place is great .\\nI had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of .\\nThe waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal  \\nService was prompt   friendly and great .\\nSlightly on the pricey side but worth it  \\nGreat pizza and fantastic service .\\nThere was a small wait   but shorter than I expected .\\nLocated at the end of a magnificent block .\\nVery cozy and warm inside ... .\\nI will be back  \\nThis is the best sushi in new york city  hands down .\\nThe place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .\\nGet the tuna of gari .\\nThe one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .\\nPlanet Thailand has always been a hit with me   I go there usually for the sushi   which is great   the thai food is excellent too .\\nWith the great variety on the menu   I eat here often and never get bored .\\nThe atmosphere is n t the greatest   but I suppose that  s how they keep the prices down .\\nIt  s all about the food  \\nI went there with my friend last saturday .\\nfirst it took us a long time to find the place .\\nwe were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant   then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers .\\nbut when we looked at the menu   there were n t a lot of choices   most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .\\nthen we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi .\\nthose rolls were big   but not good and sashimi was n t fresh .\\nthey were dry and disgusting   i did n t even finish my first piece .\\nHurley  s is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came .\\nTry the crunchy tuna   it is to die for .\\nTry everything for that matter   it is all good .\\nI have been going there since it opened and I ca n t get enough .\\nFirst went here to enjoy their garden terrace .\\nThe food was amazing   and the service was prompt and helpful   but not overbearing or rushed .\\nThe Steak Tartare is a great bet   they fix it for you at the table .\\nAdmittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm   but the open kitchen is part of the charm .\\nGreat wine selection   Gigondas is worth the price   and the house champagne is a great value .\\nIt may be a bit packed on weekends   but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .\\nHave recommended the place to friends   always gets good response .\\nPizza  the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings  the crust tastes like the best   freshly baked bread  \\nVeal Parmigana  Better than Patsy  s  \\nMuch more reasonably priced too  \\nI take all my NYC guests to VT  s .\\nNot sure where the previous reviewer   lonk   dined   but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food  \\nI  ve been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .\\nI  d highly recommend it for a special occasion  it provides and intimate setting and nice service .\\nI  m not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much ... and we  re repeat customers .\\nEven after they overcharged me the last time I was there .\\nMake sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll ... .\\nit  s delicious  \\nMoules were excellent   lobster ravioli was VERY salty  \\nTook my mom for Mother  s Day   and the maitre d  was pretty rude .\\nTold us to sit anywhere   and when we sat he said the table was reserved .\\nStepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting .\\nTiny dessert was $ 8.00 ... just plain overpriced for what it is .\\nThe drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced .\\nTry their chef  s specials  they are to die for .\\nService is not exactly five star   but thats not really a big deal .\\nDownstairs lounge is always a good attraction .\\nRaga  s is a romantic   cozy restaurant .\\nThe exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .\\nIt is also extremely well priced .\\nThe staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .\\nThe bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .\\nThis is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed .\\nYour friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem  \\nWhen we stumbled on Leon   we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT   we were certainly wrong .\\nThe waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet   we were told no ... .\\nThen   to top things off   she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend  s jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes .\\nSuch a disappointment ... .\\nRude service   medicore food ... there are tons of restaurants in NY ... stay away from this one .\\nI had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde  \\nI loved everythig about itespecially the shows and actors .\\nOur server was very helpful and friendly .\\nI am bringing my whole family back next time .\\nThe food was good too .\\nThe tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .\\nThe outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .\\nInside is a little cramped   but to be expected .\\nService was prompt and courteous .\\nThis was a repeat visit and we  ll definitely be back again .\\nGreat service   great food .\\nPrices are in line .\\nCompared to other shabu restaurants around town   this places wins handsdown .\\nBut too far east  \\nI live a block away and go to Patsy  s frequently .\\nThe pizza is delicious  they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap   frozen   shredded cheese common to most pizzaria  s .\\nTwo complaints  their appetizer selection stinks   it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .\\nAlso   because it is so thin   it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .\\nSo eat fast and order a lot .\\nWait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS  \\nBy far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant .\\nfine dining restaurant quality .\\nOver 100 different choices to create your own .\\nA must try  \\nOn a recent Sunday afternoon   a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT .\\nThis was the perfect quiet   relaxing   and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .\\nThe chicken pot pie is excpetiona   the cheeseburger huge and delictable   and the service professional wan warm .\\nWith so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district   is truly an excellent find  \\nWe will return many times for this oasis in midtown .\\nI grew up on these bagels .\\nThe staff is no nonsense .\\nThe food options rule .\\nWhen I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .\\nWorth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store .\\nI stumbled upon this second floor walkup two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. .\\nBeing serious sushi lovers   we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .\\nI asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni .\\nLRB For those of you who do n t know   Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese   which happens to be my favorite . RRB\\nHe served me an Uni Hand roll   which I never had before   and let me tell you ... IT WAS HEAVEN  \\nAside from the Sea Urchin   the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail   Boton Shrimp   Blue Fin Torro LRB Fatty Tuna RRB   Sea Eel   etc. .\\nThe sake menu should not be overlooked  \\nAll in all   this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .\\nTry the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .\\nWe visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $ 35 menu .\\nService was very good  prompt   attentive and nonintrusive .\\nFood was very good as well   considering that we tried the budget selection LRB though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer   so that fat was more of a meltinyourmouth experience RRB .\\nWine list selection is good and winebytheglass was generously filled to the top .\\nTraditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy  the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .\\nI  ve been to at Cafe Spice probably 58 times   it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square .\\nTo sum it up   Service varies from good to mediorce   depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average Ok .\\nSeating is always prompt   though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .\\nFood is usually very good   though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .\\nAs many other reviewers noticed   your order is often slow to arrive  this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .\\nThe decor is vibrant and eyepleasing with several semiprivate boths on the right side of the dining hall   which are great for a date .\\nI have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye .\\nThe first time I went   and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere   I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .\\nI  ve never ordered anything else from their menu ... there  s no need to .\\nIt  s simply the best meal in NYC .\\nYou can not go wrong at the Red Eye Grill .\\nIf we were to move from the upper east side   we would genuinely miss this restaurant .\\nWe  ve lived in the area for more than 8 years .\\nThe restaurant is cute but not upscale .\\nThe food is a diamond in rough  the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .\\nI would highly recommend it .\\nIt  s one of our favorite places to eat in NY .\\nWe had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .\\nWe were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .\\nAfter really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .\\nThe server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .\\nThe place  s decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .\\nI highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks  \\nIf you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained   this is a great place to go and eat .\\nMy husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary   and to our surprise it was fantastic .\\nThe have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious   if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .\\nThe entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .\\nPlease take my advice   go and try this place .\\nIts located in greenewich village .\\nYou will not be disapointed at all .\\nOur first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel .\\nWe were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem .\\nThe bagel was huge .\\nThey were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .\\nThe workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese LRB gets a little messy RRB .\\nI loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND .\\nThis was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart  s and I must say how delicous the food and the service was .\\nWhen I called this morning   I did n t think I would be able to get in at 12   but I was able to get in   along with four other guests .\\nI have to highly recommend the lobster roll  not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster .\\nOther guests enjoyed pizza   santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .\\nI highly recommend Cafe St. Bart  s for their food   the ambience and wonderful service .\\nAll the staff is absolutely professional  \\nI sometimes see the waiters do n t have enough knowledge of their dishes .\\nBut they do .\\nLRB that is A MUST   but not every restaurant can do ... RRB .\\nIf you want to dine with large party   I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT .\\nThere  s nice and quiet   small but enough for 6 LRB or more RRB .\\nThis restaurant was way overhyped .\\nMy chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .\\nOkayi do n t mind the oily part LRB cause most are cooked that way RRB but it was way too bland .\\nThe scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .\\nThe service was the only thing good about this restaurant .\\nIt  s boring on the inside   and our sushi was pretty below average ... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor .\\nI definitely would n t go back .\\nThere are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # 1 .\\nTheir pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .\\nThe price is reasonable although the service is poor .\\nfresh restaurant was amazing ... ... food was delicious and of course fresh .\\ngreat for a romantic evening   or a fun evening with friends ... .\\nI will be going back very soon .\\nkeep up the good work .\\nHats off to the chef .\\nI am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food   but my friend who took me there is .\\nHe has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine .\\nIt was wonderful .\\nthe salads are delicious   both refreshing and very spicy .\\nWe had Pam  s special fried fish and it was amazing .\\ntoo large for just two people but nothing was left .\\nUnbelievable .\\nHad a late night dinner on a Saturday night .\\nGreat vibe   lots of people .\\nMy husband and I both ordered the Steak   medium .\\nMy husbands was perfect   my was well done and dry .\\nI did n t complain   I liked the atmosphere so much .\\nWill give it another chance before I write it off .\\nVisited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .\\nOn a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .\\nAmbience is so cute and quaint   good for business although we were there on vacation .\\nSalads were fantastic .\\nAlthough we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .\\nIngredients are organic which is a real plus for me .\\nWe will be back .\\nThis is some really good   inexpensive sushi .\\nIt costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an insideout roll   but the roll more than triples in size   and that  s not just from the rice .\\nThe spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I  ve had at this price range .\\nThe Yellowtail was particularly good as well .\\nI have reservations about the all you can eat deal   however  the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .\\nIn any event   this is a place I  ll be sure to stop by again when I  m in this part of town .\\nBig Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment .\\nThey have it all  great price   food   and service .\\nThe atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .\\nThe food is prepared quickly and efficiently .\\nAnd it all comes at a very reasonable price LRB congee   noodles   and rice dishes are no more than $ 36 each RRB .\\nThe takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .\\nThis place is always very crowded and popular .\\nWent here on a friend  s reccomendation .\\nEnjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese ... both very tasty .\\nWe both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .\\nWe concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake   both were delicious .\\nWe  d go back again .\\nI recently went to this restaurant with some coworkers for lunch and had an amazing time .\\nThe staff was accomodating   the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .\\nWe even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .\\nYes   the prices are high   but I felt it was worth it .\\nWe all felt it was worth it .\\nsometimes i get good food and ok service .\\nsometimes i get bad food and bad service   sometimes i get good good and bad service .\\nit is not consistent .\\nreally depends on your luck  \\nThe place is a BISTRO which means   simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .\\nAnd where does Patis go wrong ; no where .\\nYou are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but   Cassuolet   Steake Fritte   Tripe Stew   etc ; simple stuff .\\nAnd evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful .\\nRight off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .\\nMine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta LRB raddichio was kind of bitter though RRB .\\nMy friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .\\nThe sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .\\nKind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .\\nOverall I would recommend it and go back again .\\nComing from Boston this place is like Emma  s Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge LRB although they have more funky toppings   RRB\\nI started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two .\\nFor dinner I had the chicken tikkamasala and some garlic naan .\\nMMmmm ... it was delicious .\\nService was slow   but the people were friendly .\\nIt  s a nice place to relax and have conversation .\\nI ca n t wait to go back .\\nWe have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant .\\nThe food is authentic Italian  delicious  \\nPizza is terrific   as is homemade pasta .\\nAmbience is delightful   service impeccable .\\nI  m still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .\\nThe hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .\\nService was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .\\nDO not try unless you  re just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .\\nI go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .\\nThis is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .\\nThe filet mignon dish was superb  \\nI would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .\\nIt  s a small cute restaurant .\\nI absolutely love this place  \\nFrom the street it looks very hidden   and is actually an old warehouse .\\nI like the ambience   it  s very dark and original .\\nI came here for my friend  s birthday and keep coming back ever since .\\nThe sushi is amazing  \\nAnd amazingly cheap .\\nBig thumbs up  \\nVery affordable and excellent ambient  \\nWe ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai .\\nWe were very disappointed .\\nWe wo n t go to this place again for a good meal .\\nHowever   I think this place is a good hang out spot .\\nNext time   we would n t dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks .\\nMy Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time  \\nTHe Pizza and wine were excellentthe service too  but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area .\\nIt is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY  I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .\\nThey tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter   so i  m looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it .\\nCheck this place out  \\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED  \\nFirst of all   this place is * not * romantic   as claimed by Citysearch  s editorial review .\\nEither that   or the editor  s idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table   while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .\\nThe tables are crammed way too close   the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant   and the wine list is simply overpriced .\\nSlightly above average wines start at $ 70   with only one selection listed at $ 30   .\\nService is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .\\nFor instance   plates were just dumped on the table   I was handed the wine list upside down   etc ... .\\nSomehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .\\nTo be completely fair   the only redeeming factor was the food   which was above average   but could n t make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .\\nTo celebrate a birthday   three of us went to Mare anticipating great food .\\nNot one of our meals was edible  bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .\\nFish was overdone .\\nCute place   nice wait staff but would never go there again .\\nSomeone else recommended the dessert  we also left that .\\nOne of us actually liked the expresso  that  s it .\\nSkip this restaurant   it  s a big disappointment .\\nMyagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City ; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else .\\nI  ve never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .\\nTheir tuna tartar appetizer is to die for .\\nI come from a family of pizzeria owners   and I  m almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino  s blows my families receipies away .\\nIt is simply amazing .\\nThe place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious .\\nI highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try .\\nYou will find yourself returning quite often .\\nP.S. Please do n t tell anyone in my family i eat there .\\nLOL .\\nA restaurant that does n t try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .\\nNo gimmicks here  the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation .\\nThe dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over  how refreshing  \\nThe service was impeccable and unobtrusive  the staff knows what they are there to do  to know their menu   present your meal   and attend to your needs .\\nLooking around   I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant   not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .\\nBeautiful experience .\\nThe view is breathtaking the service is top notch ... the ambiance is wonderfull .\\nThe staff offers impeccable service .\\nI had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz of Maine Lobster in it .\\nMy boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque .\\nI had Filet Mignon with garlic mash .\\nIt was divine melts in your mouth .\\nMy boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good .\\nWe did n t want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough .\\nWe had Lava Cake ... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1/2 to make it .\\nIt  s cuz it  s so good you need to taste it  \\nAll in all we  re already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks  \\nMy wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .\\nIf you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .\\nIt  s very spicy but not offensive .\\nWe will definitely go back .\\nGo to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food .\\nThe portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter .\\nThe wine list is excellent .\\nThe food is amazing ... especially if you get the Chef  s tasting menu and your favourite bottle LRB or two RRB of wine from an extensive selection of wines .\\nThe place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded   but the service is excellent and it  s great for friends out   a romantic date   or a special occassion .\\nPeople dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans .\\nThe food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n t like .\\nRecommendations   of course   are required  \\nPlease be aware that it  s CASH or AMEX only  \\nWith the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering   the food here was decent   not great .\\nThe menu is very limited  i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .\\nWe ordered the special   grilled branzino   that was so infused with bone   it was difficult to eat .\\nThe decor in this place is very dinerish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village  not romantic   just simple   small and sparse .\\nProblem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .\\nNo plans to return anytime soon .\\nThis place is so much fun .\\nOur family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .\\nThis place must have cost the owners afortune to build .\\nI think the stuff was better than Disney .\\nOur food was great too  \\nAnd really large portions .\\nThe staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York .\\nWe will go back every time we are in the City .\\nIf you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde .\\nIt is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects .\\nThe food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .\\nI highly recommend it .\\nI am going to the mid town location next .\\nThe place is a lot of fun .\\nMy six year old loved it .\\nThe characters really make for an enjoyable experience .\\nThe food however   is what one might expect .\\nIt is very overpriced and not very tasty .\\nHowever   I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .\\nWe had a good time .\\nWent there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them .\\nService was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .\\nDrinks way over priced .\\nFood was good not great not worth the wait or another visit .\\nGreat pizza for lunch place .\\nService was quick .\\nThe pizza was great .\\nAnd it was quick which is very important .\\nHave the iced tea .\\nIt was wonderful .\\nWhenever you need a Sushi fix   Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .\\nDelivery is fast too .\\nGreat friendly service   Fast seating   Fast Delivery   Excellent sushi .\\nA little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite .\\nGrowing up in NY   I have eaten my share of bagels .\\nEssABagel LRB either by Stytown or midtown RRB is by far the best bagel in NY .\\nThe bagels always warm   soft on the inside   crispy on the outside and enormous in size .\\nThey have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .\\nThe lox is always fresh too .\\nHighly recommended to all  \\nI have to agree with the previous reviewer .\\nI do n t get it either .\\nNot impressed with the food .\\nPrices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .\\nZero ambiance to boot .\\nI thought this place was totally overrated .\\nEverything we had was good or ok ... but definitely nothing great .\\nThe ambience was nice   but service was n t so great .\\nWhen you add it all together   it just does n t seem worth it to me ... especially considering the prices .\\nThis is the BEST ShabuShabu Restaurant in the TryState Area .\\nI have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .\\nThius is a must for anyone who loves ShabuShabu .\\nThe atmosphere is nothing special   but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo .\\nThe owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .\\nDespite a slightly limited menu   everything prepared is done to perfection   ultra fresh and a work of food art .\\nI must give it Yon out of Yon stars  \\nTaxan delicious  \\nArigato Gozimas Yuka  \\nThis restaurant was recommended by a local ... as a matter of fact   he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed  \\nWe were n t  \\nThe prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food .\\nWe liked it so much   that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York .\\nWent there for an office lunch .\\nThe location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it .\\nThere is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me .\\nTry green curry with vegetables .\\nThe quantity is also very good   you will come out satisfied .\\nThe service is ok   some of the people did n t get what they asked for .\\nI was there on sat   for my birthday and we had an excellent time .\\nI had the best ravioli ever .\\nThe wine the service was very good too .\\nModerate prices .\\nA little noise but I think that was because of our party  \\nMolto bene  \\nThis quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list .\\nThe food is delicious  from the specials to the regular menufare   the dishes are never a disappointment .\\nWhether it  s the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar   you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .\\nAlthough the tables may be closely situated   the candlelight   foodquality and service overcompensate .\\nA guaranteeed delight  \\nI have known about this secret for the last 13 years   Emilio LRB the Godfather RRB has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .\\nIf you go   try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce   the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm ... everything is just delicious .\\nCheck out the secret back room .\\nOld school meets New world .\\nI pray it stays open forever .\\nThank You Emilio .\\nCiao Bella .\\nI found the food   service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .\\nThe food was authentic .\\nI felt as though I were eating in Paris .\\nThe service was excellent  friendly and attentive .\\nThe prices are wonderfully low .\\nVery good wine choices .\\nI ca n t believe people complain about no cheese sticks  \\nWho has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC  \\nGet the pepperoni  YUM  and a family style salad .\\nGreat staff .\\nAlways great service  \\nI go twice a month  \\nFantastic  \\nThe food is good   I ca n t lie .\\nBut the staff was so horrible to us .\\nThe hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .\\nWe were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .\\nThis place is pricey   and yes   the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price .\\nSave yourself the time and trouble and skip this one  \\nI  ll keep this short .\\nAmma is nothing special .\\nThe two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place .\\nI ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .\\nWill not be back .\\nDo n t dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes   they are simply not up to par with the nonveg selections .\\nDecor is nice though service can be spotty .\\nThis place is always packed .\\nI know because I live nearby .\\nMost importantly   food is excellent .\\nTry the sea bass .\\nHighly recommended .\\nFirst of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .\\nAs a student in NYU i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by .\\nbut ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here .\\nI am happy i did the food was awsome .\\nJUST AWSOME .\\nand yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .\\nThey are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .\\nbut overall i give it a 10 .\\n10 .\\nI have n t been to the other locations .\\nHaru on Park S is simply disgusting .\\nThe fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .\\nQuite frankly   this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried .\\nWill never be back .\\nhonestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .\\nbelieve us   we  ve been eating sushi for over 15 yrs .\\nnot sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly .\\nthe allucaneat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .\\nlimited menu   nosofresh ingredients   thinlysliced fish   fallapart rice .\\nthe only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce LRB even its low sodium RRB   the vinegarsoaked rice   and the scallion on top of the fish .\\nthe waitstaffs are nice though .\\nwont come back again for sure  \\nI have been to Roth  s twice and both times were very disappointing .\\nOnce for dinner and once for brunch .\\nBoth times I was extremely dissappointed by the service   which was boarderline rude .\\nThey wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .\\nMuch of the time it seems like they do not care about you .\\nThe dinner was ok   nothing I would have again .\\nI had their eggs benedict for brunch   which were the worst in my entire life   I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .\\nThis was a great surprise .\\nWith the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .\\nThe service was attentive .\\nI look forward to eating here again .\\nPlanet Thai is great  \\nWe love the food   drinks   and atmosphere  \\nThe svc can be a bit rude at times   esp if you have big group   but overall the restaurant is a must  \\nTry the Pad Thai   it  s fabulous and their prices are so cheap  \\nJust because it  s cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty   IT IS GREAT  \\nJust remember   the later you go   the longer you may have to wait .\\nIt  s popular w/the late crowd .\\nThey forgot a sandwich   did n t include plastic forks   and did n t include pita with the hummus platter .\\nAlso   the sandwiches LRB nearing $ 7 RRB did n t come with anything like chips or a side .\\nOverall   not worth the money .\\nEating in   the atmosphere saves it   but at your desk   it  s a very disappointing experience .\\nI love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it .\\nChennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city .\\nThey have authentic Indian at amazin prices .\\nThis restaurant is VEGETARIAN ; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever .\\nThe seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .\\nIt  s a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early .\\nPatroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .\\nThe food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate .\\nThis is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .\\nNot a great place for family or general dining .\\nLLOOVVE THIS PLACE .\\nFood is excellent .\\nFish is so very fresh .\\nWaitstaff are very friendly .\\nLove YUKA .\\nMermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .\\nThe menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .\\nThe lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great .\\nThe service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .\\nThe only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .\\nEven though its good seafood   the prices are too high .\\nThe lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .\\nWent to Village last night for my birthday .\\nWe picked it randomly   without a recommendation from someone who has been there   so we were n t sure what to expect .\\nWe were very pleasantly surprised .\\nThe food was delicious LRB I had a halibut special   my husband had steak RRB   and the service was topnotch .\\nWhen my dessert came   there was a candle in it  not because anyone asked for one  but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift   and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .\\nTruly the mark of an attentive waiter .\\nI highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .\\nWe ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .\\nWe thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods .\\nWhy  \\nThey do n t concern much of customer  s health   just want to make money .\\nplease do n t fool us .\\nI visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke .\\nI recommend the jelly fish   drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings   certainly the stir fry blue crab .\\nThe food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .\\nOf course   it is crowded but who cares .\\nAuthentic Shanghai style and I can not recommend a better Shanghai place in New York .\\nHave frequented ` ino for several years and the food remains excellent .\\nCheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .\\nThe large selection of bruschettas   paninis   tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .\\nLRB The asparagus   truffle oil   parmesan bruschetta is a winner   RRB\\nWine list is extensive without being overpriced .\\nBe sure to try the seasonal   and always delicious   specials .\\nDefinitely a neighborhood favorite .\\nI loved this place  \\nI almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .\\nThe food was very good   a great deal   and the place its self was great .\\nThe wait staff is very freindly   they make it feel like you  re eating in a freindly little european town .\\nI like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong   it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent  \\nThe service was terrible   we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .\\nThe waitress   seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .\\nAfter dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend   asked him   Where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in America ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .\\nWe did tip   I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager .\\nThe whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff   because despite the current one this is a great place .\\nPizza here is consistently good .\\nSalads are a delicious way to begin the meal .\\nYou should pass on the calamari .\\nIt is thick and slightly soggy .\\nDecor is charming .\\nService is average .\\nWhat a great place .\\nI came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband .\\nThe ambience was so fun   and the prices were great   on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .\\nI was n t thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes   but I guess that  s the price you pay for a popular place .\\nI would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine  \\nI was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .\\nA gentleman   maybe the manager   came to our table   and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .\\nWhen asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants   he replied this is not Mcdonald  s   every place makes things differently .\\nWhile it is understandable that every place is indeed different   there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .\\nThe service was poor   restaurant poorly lit   staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald  s than this joint .\\nNever again  \\nI absolutely Loved this place .\\nMy friends spoke so much about it for months   I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in .\\nExcellent atmosphere   delicious dishes good and friendly service .\\nthis is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions .\\nI think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .\\nThe wine list is also really nice .\\nA friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8 30 .\\nEverything was wonderful ; food   drinks   staff   mileau .\\nI would highly recommend this place  \\nI have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there .\\nThe food is great and reasonably priced .\\nI have tried to make reservations   but both times   the hostess did n t have my name .\\nIf the weather is nice   try to snag an outside table .\\nThe staff has been nice   but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .\\nMy boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent .\\nFrom the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff   I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .\\nConsidering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time   the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed .\\nI highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .\\nNice Family owned traditional restaurant .\\nFresh ingredients and everything is made to order .\\nI was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .\\nFriendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you  re with .\\nMy friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend .\\nI found the food to be outstanding   particulary the salmon dish I had .\\nI also ordered the Change Mojito   which was out of this world .\\nMy friends settled for rice dishes   but we came back the following day to try the dim sum   which was good ... not outstanding   but good .\\nWe ate out in the back patio   which is worth it as it  s cool and the music is hear well there .\\nOverall   excellent restaurant  \\ni went to utsav about a yr ago with my family .\\nThe food was good .\\nThe place was nice and calm .\\nbut the service was a bit slow .\\nI work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time .\\nThe buffet had a nice selection .\\nThe food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .\\nService was also very good .\\nI would go back .\\nI got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .\\nI would recommend Roxy  s for that   but not for their food .\\nMy son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge  \\nBut   they were too big for the bun .\\nConsequently   their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ` nt feel like finishing them .\\nAlso they were $ 15 each  \\nI had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .\\nIt was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of Pastramibut it did n t have much tasteI  ve had better for less elsewhere  \\nThis place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant   the food .\\nThe last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it   and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .\\nAnd the Tom Kha soup was pathetic .\\nIf you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go .\\nWe went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday   and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .\\nThe pesto pizza was excellent   thincrust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I  d never heard of before .\\nConveniently located too   being right on Bedford ave .\\nTHe back garden sitting area is very pleasant   where you can see their personal herb garden .\\nI will definetly be going back .\\nWe had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC .\\nMy husband said he could  ve eaten several more   the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .\\nWe had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .\\nI recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .\\nWe waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right .\\nWe will be back .\\nlove the food .\\nit  s the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food .\\nit helps if you know what to order .\\nand you ca n t beat the prices .\\nhighly recommended .\\nI  ve lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all .\\nGreat food   good size menu   great service and an unpretensious setting .\\nThe dishes offered were unique   very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages   sardines with biscuits   large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream LRB the best and freshest I  ve ever had RRB .\\nI  m glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY .\\nWe have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets   and Joya is the best .\\nThe freshest   best variety   and the fastest delivery .\\nAlso very inexpensive .\\nA great choice at any cost and a great deal .\\nThe service was excellent and the food was delicious .\\nWe are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included   ceviche mix LRB special RRB   crab dumplings   assorted sashimi   sushi and rolls   two types of sake   and the banana tempura .\\nOverall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites   but everything was delicious .\\nDefinitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date .\\nAverage to good Thai food   but terrible delivery .\\nI  ve waited over one hour for food .\\nThey were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .\\nA Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner  \\nThe food arrived 20 minutes after I called   cold and soggy .\\ni actually feel like i should keep it a secret .\\nThis is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money .\\nAn excellent service .\\nWent to Cafe Spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night .\\nWe were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial .\\nShe was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food .\\nWe were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry .\\nThe food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .\\nWe ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun LRB dessert RRB recommended by the waiter .\\nI thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .\\nI went here with a friend on a whim   we went someplace else first and could n t get a table .\\nService here was great   food was fantastic .\\nGuacamole   shrimp appetizer was really great   we both had the filet   very good   did n t much like the frites that came with   but the filet was so good   neither of us cared .\\nWill absolutely visit again .\\nMaybe tomorrow ;RRB .\\nYou can not go wrong with this place .\\nThe food is outstanding and the service is quick   friendly and very professional .\\nAlways a nice crowd   but never loud .\\nGo here .\\nGood for dates or with friends .\\nI am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded .\\nHowever   it is jus too good to not praise it .\\nBy far   the best pizza in Manhattan .\\nThe crust is thin   the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .\\nFor all you lazy folks that do n t want to come to Alphabet City   I say   good  stay out .\\nless wait time for me  \\nWe arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly .\\nThe menu has so many fish items and oysters .\\nWe all ordered different entrees so we could share .\\nThe fish was really   really fresh .\\nI lived in Maine for ten years and grew up on fish .\\nWe all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York .\\nI stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood .\\nAll of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better  \\nI highly recommend the Sophia pizza .\\nIt  s to die for  \\nThe food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .\\nImmediately after we paid   the waiter took the money and said   okay   you guys are outta here .\\nThere are other people waiting  \\nWe were n t even at our table for more than an hour total .\\nAs we were leaving   the couple standing by the door said to another waiter   we  re not in a hurry .\\nOur friends have not arrived yet .\\nSo rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary  \\nFor the people who want great food plus great service   Roxy is a place to AVOID  \\nI  ve been here twice now .\\nThe first time the sushi was outstanding   the second time it was a little bland .\\nI  m sure I  ll return for a final judgement tho .\\nThe blond wood decor is very soothing   the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .\\nMizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy .\\nWhile their kitchen food is delicious   their Sushi is out of this world .\\nMizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .\\nNot only is the cuisine the best around   the service has always been attentive and charming .\\nWarning   You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu  \\nThalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you   but the food does n t quite match up .\\nI ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor .\\nThe entree was bland and small   dessert was not inspired .\\nI expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu .\\nThe view is spectacular   and the food is great .\\nWonderful strawberry daiquiries as well  \\nDefinitely worth the trip to Battery Park City  \\nOne of my favorite places in Manhattan .\\nAuthentic Taiwanese food that  s cheap ... what more could you ask for  \\nLRB Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city RRB .\\nThe cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan .\\ndelicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .\\nKind   attentive wait staff .\\nI really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi LRB on saffron risottoyum RRB .\\nMy friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos .\\nDelicious crab cakes too .\\nEven if the food was n t this good   the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .\\nGreat neighborhood joint .\\nThis is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice .\\nTheir calzones are horrific   bad   vomitinducing   YUCK .\\nThey smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .\\nThe counter service is bad .\\nThey charge different prices all the time .\\nThey  re rude at times   and not very friendly .\\nNO PIZZA 33 for me  \\nAnybody who likes this place must be from a different planet   where greasy   dry and tasteless are complimentary .\\nThe dosas are skimpy   unattractive and drip with grease   and personally I  d drink popcorn topping before I  d eat another one of these .\\nThe sandwiches are dry   tasteless and way overpriced .\\nCalling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance   but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .\\nSeriously   this place kicks ass .\\nThe atmosphere is unheralded   the service impecible   and the food magnificant .\\nBest Italian food I ever had LRB and being Italian   that means alot RRB .\\nIt is nearly impossible to get a table   so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner   DO NOT pass it up .\\nThis is such a lovely   peaceful place to eat outside .\\nThe restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .\\nIt is set far from the small street it  s on   and there is no traffic noise .\\nThe food is good   especially their more basic dishes   and the drinks are delicious .\\nThis is a great place to take outoftowners   and perfect for watching the sunset .\\nGreat sushi experience .\\nNice value .\\nUnique apppetizers .\\nTry sushimi cucumber roll .\\nGood spreads   great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .\\nTHE BIG COMPLAINT   NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .\\nI complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted .\\nMurray wo n t do it .\\nWo n t or Ca n t is not in the service directory .\\nBut who says Murray  s is anything about service .\\nSo close   but not good enough .\\nDo n t be fooled by crowds of people .\\nThe service is awful .\\nThis place is not worth the prices .\\nAlso   do n t plan on asking for your favorite roll   if it  s not on the menu   you ca n t have it .\\nLove Pizza 33 ... .\\nI will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing ... their Pizza .\\nI live in the neightborhood and am a regular .\\nIt hits the spot every time .\\nThis tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .\\nThe pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC .\\nEven the pasta is delicious here LRB a rarity in New York pizza restaurants RRB .\\nI  ve been many time and have never been disappointed .\\nCompared to Essa   Tal offers a less doughy bagel  \\nThey even scoop it out nice LRB for those on a diet RRB not too much not to little .\\nThe cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee  \\nA little crowded but they move that line really fast  \\nA little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning  \\nBagels are ok   but be sure not to make any special requests  \\nI asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere  \\nBe sure not to get anything other than bagels ...  \\nthe turkey burgers are scary  \\nThe worst excuse for Japanese food I  ve ever encountered .\\nThe soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .\\nThe sushi was awful  \\nThe rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .\\nFurthermore   the rice had no seasoning   so the sushi was bland and disgusting .\\nThe fish was adequate   but inexpertly sliced .\\nIt is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine .\\nGood   fast service .\\nI would highly recommend .\\nFood is great and inexpensive .\\nThe location is perfect .\\nGive it a try and enjoy .\\nI thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience .\\nJimmy is Dominican  \\nWell   this place is so Ghetto its not even funny .\\nIf you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you  ll love it here .\\nWould NEVER go back there .\\nToo bad Latin Quarters closed .\\nThat place was awesome       sally  \\nAwsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice .\\nAlways busy but fast moving .\\nGreat atmoshere and worth every bit .\\nOpen late LRB well as late as I ever got there and I  m a night person RRB .\\nWinnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .\\nThe food is reliable and the price is moderate .\\nWhat more can you ask for  \\nFor authentic Thai food   look no further than Toons .\\nIve been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before   and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had LRB except for my mom  s of course RRB .\\nTry the Pad Thai   or sample anything on the appetizer menu ... they  re all delicious .\\nEverything about this restaurant was special .\\nThe service was attentive   yet discreet .\\nThe flavors robust and subtle .\\nThe brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .\\nI  m saving up for my next visit .\\nI went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .\\nThe place was quiet and delightful .\\nService was good and food is wonderful .\\nI did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad LRB they are all good RRB .\\nIt is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat .\\nAs a retired hipster   I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laidback late night in the city .\\nThe wait staff is pleasant   fun   and for the most part gorgeous LRB in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way   not in that she swaycuterthanmethatb@#$* way RRB .\\nThe food is yummy   especially their cookedtoperfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .\\nBut the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere   delightfully free of the BTs .\\nYou can get a completely delish martini in a glass LRB that  s about 2.1/2 drinks RRB for $ 8.50 LRB I recommend the Vanilla Shanty   mmmm ... RRB in a great homey setting with great music .\\nThe inhouse lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music   and moreover   takes requests .\\nYou ca n t go wrong with this place .\\nSuan is a great place that I often take my friends LRB classmates RRB too .\\nIts location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable   makes students go back to Suan again and again .\\nI LOVE their Thai .\\nnoodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST  \\nI was in love with Pongsri on 48th   but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced .\\nI will go back to Suan soon  \\nIn summereat outside on a terrace LRB another great feature of Suan RRB  \\nI can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .\\nI can not imagine better Indian food in all of the city .\\nI can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .\\nThis restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location .\\nDuring the course of the past 3 months   the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .\\nI wish they would change back to what it was before .\\nThe food now is inconsistent .\\nThis is the kind of place you  d like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .\\nThe setting is casual and romantic .\\nPrices are very good .\\nThe food is excellent  \\nif you  re daring   try the balsamic vinegar over icecream   it  s wonderful  \\nDo not get the Go Go Hamburgers   no matter what the reviews say .\\nThey were such a ripoff LRB $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns RRB and not worth trying .\\nThe rest of the dim sum   though pricey by Chinatown standards   is worth it .\\nSteamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table .\\nThe wait here is long for dim sum   but if you do n t like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig   this is a sleek LRB for Chinatown RRB alternative .\\nA few tips   skip the turnip cake   roast pork buns and egg custards .\\nThese are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner   .\\nLRB 1 RRB turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard .\\nLRB 2 RRB egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal .\\nAfter passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner .\\nI was pleasantly suprised .\\nThe food was exceptional .\\nThe menu consisted of standard brassiere food   better then places like Balthazar etc. .\\nI choose to go with one of the special   the braised lamb shank in red wine   which was excellent .\\nThe service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .\\nThe restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal .\\nthis little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .\\nthe pad se ew chicken was delicious   however the pad thai was far too oily .\\ni would just ask for no oil next time .\\nHave eaten at Ginger House several times   and it  s always good .\\nThe fried dumplings are GREAT  \\nFinally a reliable Chinese restaurant  \\nThis place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .\\nThe only thing you can do here is walk in and eat ... but planning an event   especially a small   intimate one   forget about it .\\nThey are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place   but also become hostile  \\nNobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end   not one person takes responsibility for anything .\\nTerrible   terrible management  deserves to be shutdown .\\nNever fails to please .\\ndelicious bagels   especially when right out of the oven .\\nSpreads and toppings are great  though a bit pricey .\\nService is fast and friendly .\\nOnly drawback  they wo n t toast your bagel   and they do n t make eggs for the bagel .\\nBut that is highly forgivable .\\nBeen there   done that   and New York   it  s not that big a deal .\\nThe food is decent at best   and the ambience   well   it  s a matter of opinion   some may consider it to be a sweet thing   I thought it was just annoying .\\nIf celebrities make you sweat   then your in for a ride   but if your like most around these parts then you  ll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .\\nRao is a good restaurant   but it  s nothing special .\\nI  ve eaten at many different Indian restaurants .\\nBut after last night   Spice Grill is the only place I  m eating indian cuisine .\\nYou must try the shrimp appetizers .\\nEven my Indian friend could n t believe how good and tasty everything was .\\nThis place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .\\nGreat food   great prices   great service .\\nIf you are looking for a good quality   cheap eats  this is the place .\\nit  s a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food .\\nI really loved the different and inovated touch that  s the cheff gives to the food .\\nalso it  s great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place   the service it  s just perfect ... they  re so frendly that we never want to live the place  \\nI love Essabagel   but I live on the west side   so I often go to Murray  s for convenience .\\nTheir bagels are fine   but they are a little overcooked   and not really a ` special   bagel experience .\\nBetter than the bagel shop on the corner   but not worth going out of your way for   in my opinion .\\nAlso a little more expensive than your average bagel place .\\nGreat bagels made the oldfashioned way .\\nThe appetizing is excellent  just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price LRB if bought by the pound RRB .\\nDrawbacks   service is slow and they do n t toast  \\nThe food was absolutely amazing  \\nThe baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we  ve ever had  \\nThe lamb was tender so full of flavor   the dessert was divine  \\nThe waiter was attentive .\\nThe place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .\\nDowntown Dinner 2002  Prixe fix   Appetizers were ok   waiter gave me poor suggestion ... try the potato stuff kanish best one .\\nSmall servings for main entree   i had salmon LRB wasnt impressed RRB girlfriend had chicken   it was good .\\nDessert is a joke ... dont bother .\\nVolare virgins or weekly regulars   everyone gets treated the same and you ca n t ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .\\nThe restaurant has a Family feel   not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have singlehandedly solved third world famine .\\nThe antipasta was excellent   especially the calamari   as were the filling pasta mains .\\nThe wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .\\nStill   any quibbles about the bill were offset by the pouryourown measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ... .\\nFantastic place .\\nCute and decorative .\\nA pleasant surprise .\\nGo there to relax and feel like your somewhere else .\\nLucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat .\\nYeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously   but it should n t .\\nGreat food   great decor   great service .\\nI recommend it  \\nJust ignore the trendy wannabes .\\nThis is the perfect spot for meeting friends   having lunch   dinner   pretheatre or aftertheatre drinks  \\nLRB Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer  \\nGuaranteed to be a tasty experience   RRB\\nExcellent spot for holiday get togethers with coworkers or friends that you have n t seen in a while .\\nI have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED  \\nAll the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends  \\nGo there once and oh yes ... you will go back ... you will ... .\\nWhat a great place  \\nNot the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant .\\nA cool bar with great food   and tons of excellent beer .\\nAnd even with it  s Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too  \\nLoved it  \\nOut of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens   this is among the best .\\nThe shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .\\nIt is expensive but well worth the money .\\nIf you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n t seem to find a great Italian restaurant   drive to Corona .\\nThe only thing more wonderful than the food LRB which is exceptional RRB is the service .\\nThe only thing the waiters do n t do for you is wipe your chin when you leave .\\nWonderful at holiday time .\\nCozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .\\nService was very prompt but slightly rushed .\\nFood was very good   but not what I would consider out of this world .\\nGo here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .\\nMy friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian .\\nToo bad the food was n t of the same heritage .\\nThe porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless   so was the seafood tagliatelle .\\nA real dissapointment .\\nBut that was n t the icing on the cake   a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had .\\nThey should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chipsgood but a far cry from what the name implies .\\nPriced at upper intermediate range .\\nI really liked this place .\\nEverything I had was good   and I  m a eater .\\nIt was pretty inexpensive too .\\nThis place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city .\\nI also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee LRB rice porridge RRB .\\nIt  s great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .\\nIt  s definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .\\nHowever   if you want great food at a great price and do n t mind the decor   you ca n t beat this place .\\nQuick and friendly service .\\nThis is one of the best comfort food places in the city .\\nIt  s somewhere you can eat and be happy .\\nWhen I  m feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office   I head for Cafe St. Bart  s .\\nWhen you  re sitting in their main dining room LRB which has a spectacular   handpainted high ceiling RRB you  d never know there was a world outside .\\nThe food is wonderful   tasty and filling   and the service is professional and friendly .\\nI ca n t wait for summer   when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .\\nAhhh ... .\\nI recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great .\\nThis little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .\\nThe service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .\\nI have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood .\\nThey all know you .\\nGood food .\\nGood drink .\\nHow do you rate home  \\nI have never had cheescake like this .\\nI thought I had died and gone to heaven .\\nGreat spot   whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .\\nWarm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .\\nThe food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .\\nHave been several times and it never dissapoints .\\nAfter hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant   and passing by it on a daily basis   we decided to try .\\nWe were less than impressed .\\nWhile the ambiance and atmosphere were great   the food and service could have been a lot better .\\nWe ordered the chicken casserole   but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken   all dark meat and on the bone .\\nProbably would not go again ... .\\ni  ve been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine   if not good .\\nstick with the chicken   beef   and lamb dishes .\\ni do n t usually order wine with indian so i ca n t comment on their wine list or their wines .\\ninstead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .\\nservice is friendly   and never had a problem walking in and getting a table .\\ni would recommend reservations on weekends though .\\nskip dessert .\\nBest Reuben sandwich ever  \\nA classic  \\nDo n t miss Bloom  s on your next trip to Manhatten .\\nIt was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York   and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York .\\nThanks Bloom  s for a lovely trip .\\nAs a fan of Thai   I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .\\nThe food was not fresh   the sauces were bland and very oily .\\nIt just was n t Thai .\\nWent to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza LRB as I love La Pizza Fresca RRB .\\nWas surprisingly disappointed .\\nPizza was a little soggy .\\nRavioli was good ... but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced .\\nNot enough wines by the glass either .\\nService   however   was excellent ... and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot .\\nFood was just average ... if they lowered the prices just a bit   it would be a bigger draw .\\nThis place is a great bargain .\\nAuthentic Pakistani food .\\nPeople are always friendly .\\nDo n t waste money on decor .\\nJust straight up cheap   good food .\\nFaan is sooo good .\\nThe best pad thai i  ve ever had .\\nThe design and atmosphere is just as good .\\nbottles of wine are cheap and good .\\nWhat more could you want  \\nThe food was actually aweful .\\nI  m not picky  but it was actually gross .\\nThe mussles were the fishiest things I  ve ever tasted   the seabass was bland   the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese   the penne w / chicken had bones in it ... It was disgusting .\\nNice atmosphere   the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .\\nWould n t recomend it for dinner  \\nThis is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples .\\nThe jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes .\\nThe food is amazing   rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza .\\nBest of all is the warm vibe   the owner is super friendly and service is fast .\\nIf only they delivered   they  d make a mint  \\ngo here for the drinks  \\nespecially during happy hour  \\nenough said  \\nthe drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .\\nAsk for Usha   the nicest bartender in manhattan .\\nMy fav was the sassy lassi ... .\\nThis is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .\\nI really recommend the very simple Unda LRB Egg RRB rolls .\\nDelicate spices   onions   eggs and a kickass roti .\\nAmazing  \\nToons has recently been redone   so it  s now a very attractive space .\\nThe food  s as good as ever .\\nIn an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food   this is one of the best spots .\\nWent here last night  nice decor   good service   but the food was surprisingly excellent .\\nThe portions are HUGE   so it might be good to order three things to split LRB rather than one appetizer and entree per person RRB for two people .\\nAmong all of the new 5th avenue restaurants   this offers by far one of the best values for your money .\\nCa n t wait to go back .\\nBest drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town  \\nBeef noodle soup is good as well .\\nThe service is good and the resturant is clean .\\nBest Taiwanese food in NY  \\nI have been to Rao  s probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better .\\nFor those that go once and do n t enjoy it   all I can say is that they just do n t get it .\\nRao  s has the best service and atmosphere in NYC .\\nGood luck getting a table .\\nMy roommate and I LOVE this place .\\nWe recently decided to try this location   and to our delight   they have outdoor seating   perfect since I had my yorkie with me .\\nIndoor was very cozy and cute .\\nThe portion sizes here are huge   and the sushi is good .\\nWhile it  s not Nobu   it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .\\nStaff is very accomodating .\\nExcellent dumplings served amid clean   chic decor .\\nI got the $ 10 10piece dim sum combo   every bite of which was great .\\nBut $ 1 for each small piece  \\nNot worth it .\\nI wo n t go back unless someone else is footing the bill .\\nI came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .\\nThe decor is very simple but comfortable .\\nThe food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .\\nThe portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .\\nYou must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .\\nThe staff there is very attentive and down to earth .\\nI loved it and would go again .\\nGreat Indian food and the service is incredible .\\nThe owner truly caters to all your needs .\\nWhen family came in he gave them apps to test their palets   and then ordered for them .\\nEveryone was more then happy with his choices .\\nGreat food and the prices are very reasonable .\\nObviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong   it actually means Great Prosperity .\\nThe food here does a great service to the name LRB Cantonese that is ... RRB .\\nI fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork .\\nThis dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it .\\nTry the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh   a delicious and sweet tasting bread .\\nSimply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices ... .\\nService is not what you are coming here for ... .\\nJust make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that  s all the service I need ... .\\nBig Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach .\\nthis place ... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend .\\nwhoever the jazz duo was   they were on POINT .\\ngood music   great food   speedy service affordable prices .\\neven the wine by the glass was good .\\nits a little out of the way if you do n t live in the neighborhood   but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .\\nConsistently good Japanese Tapas .\\nSame owner as the guy who owns Typhoon   which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave. .\\nAlways good drinks and service is pretty good ; .\\nAtmosphere is nice and relaxed too ... .\\nA great place to meet up for some food and drinks ... .\\nYakitori LRB bbq meats RRB is tasty too .\\nIt  s also attached to Angel  s Share   which is a cool   more romantic bar ... .\\nJust moved to the neighborhood and we  ve been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants .\\nIf you do n t mind presliced low quality fish   unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .\\nPrice and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .\\nWas n t going to share but I feel obligated ... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing .\\nNo thanks  \\nThis place   which is only a few months old   is perhaps Queens   biggest secret  \\nFabulous decor  makes you feel like you  re in a trendy Manhattan restaurant   very very good food   cheaplypriced   generally friendly staff   and if you  re a Manhattanite   or spend most of your time in Manhattan   Rice Avenue will make you feel at home ... very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ... all on Roosevelt Avenue  \\nWe were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .\\nWe were then shooed inside .\\nOne would think we  d get an apology or complimentary drinks  instead   we got a snobby waiter would n t even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .\\nWe left   never to return .\\nWith so many good restaurants on the UWS   I do n t need overpriced food   absurdly arrogant waitstaff who do n t recognize they work at a glorified diner   clumsy service   and management that does n t care .\\nI am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .\\nIf you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave. .\\nGreat bagels   spreads and a good place to hang out in .\\nYou fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town .\\nHowever it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town .\\nThe food is okay and the prices here are mediocre .\\nYou ca n t say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .\\nThey  re are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing   Queens .\\nBaluchi  s has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .\\nThe only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent .\\nHe offers subpar service and has no personality .\\nIn fact   it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .\\nSkip this location and go to the one in Soho .\\nThere is no excuse for such lousy service  \\nI have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri .\\nStuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .\\nYou can do it here .\\n$ 20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten .\\nI went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends   and spent three enjoyable hours there .\\nThe restaurant was packed at first   so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .\\nMost of the servers are very attentive   friendly and quite attractive .\\nThe atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd   but there were a few groups of mid 20  s / 30 year olds also .\\nThe vibe is very relaxed and cozy   service was great and the food was excellent  \\nMe and my girls will definitely go back .\\nFood was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went .\\nI would highly recommand requesting a table by the window .\\nAlthough they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .\\nI  ve eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times   but more often I order delivery .\\nThe food is great .\\nPersonal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .\\nI heartily recommend .\\nThere is a downside if you  re ordering in  the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude .\\nNever have I had such dramatic delivery guys LRB a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup RRB who always seem disappointed with their tips .\\nHey   I think $ 2   for a 5 block walk ai n t bad .\\nLove the scene first off  the place has a character and nice light to it ... very fortunate   location wise .\\nThe pizza was pretty good and huge .\\nThe price very reasonable .\\nWe were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally .\\nWe got most of it back at home with us .\\nI would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n t not mention or undermine .\\nThe pasta penne was pretty extra buttery   creamy which means a big task to diggest ... tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count   penne ... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed ... lol .\\nNo   really .\\nI have eaten a lot of pizza here .\\nLa Rosa waltzes in   and I think they are doing it the best .\\nInteresting selection   good wines   service fine   fun decor .\\nI have been twice to this restaurant .\\nI love it .\\nI plan on stopping by next week as well .\\nI found it on a cold night   the perfect spot to warm up .\\nI recieved prompt service with a smile .\\nTo me it exemplifies Soho   cute   artsy   interesting .\\nDefinately check it out  \\nThis place blew me away ... by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side .\\nThe wine list is extensive and impressive .\\nLOVE the atmosphere  felt like I was in Paris .\\nThe mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert ... definitely going to be back very soon .\\nI just read Mocaramel  s review and felt compelled to respond .\\nI have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna .\\nOver the years the host   Vittorio   and his crew   have always treated me as family  although with all the business this notsolittle gem does   it amazing he  s even able to remember a consistent but notsofrequent visitor .\\nI  ve also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years   A new Jazz Bar   the most fantastic Dining Garden   the Best Thin Crust Pizzas   and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for LRB these are not your average lasagnas RRB  \\nI lOVE THIS PLACE  \\nKeep up the good work guys  \\nMy girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night .\\nI have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here .\\nWe could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .\\nLuckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon   Sea Bass and Crispy Duck .\\nWe got a little tipsy from the sake but is n t that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about  \\nLove Al Di La .\\nI recommend this place to everyone .\\nGreat food .\\nOne of my favorite places in Brooklyn .\\nThe pastas are incredible   the risottos LRB particularly the sepia RRB are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing .\\nOverpriced and not tasty .\\nThe food here was mediocre at best .\\nIt was totally overpriced  fish and chips was about $ 15 ... .\\nThere are so many other great places to go to eat and drink ... this place is not worth it ... .\\nTasty Dog  \\nAn awesome organic dog   and a conscious eco friendly establishment .\\nOne of the best hot dogs I have ever eaten .\\nCa n t wait to go back .\\nThe Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it .\\nBut the best pork souvlaki I ever had is the main thing .\\nTrust me .\\nRun do n t walk .\\nSuper YUMMY Pizza  \\nI was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant .\\nI LOOOVE their eggplant pizza   as well as their pastas  \\nWe had half/half pizza   mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza  \\nWe had fun eating in there   we were there like around 3 a.m. in the morning  \\nWill comeback for sure   wish they have it here in LA. .\\nExcellent food   although the interior could use some help .\\nThe space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting   without it trying to be that .\\nI paid just about $ 60 for a good meal   though  RRB .\\nGreat sake  \\nReliable   Fresh Sushi .\\nMy husband and I take out from here 34 times a month .\\nThe sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious .\\nHave never had a problem with service save a missing rice once .\\nDelivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week .\\nDelivery guy sometimes get upset if you do n t tip more than 10   .\\nWe  ve found it to be better and fresher than Kiku which is comparable in price .\\nBest ... Sushi ... Ever .\\nThis place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi .\\nCreative   consistent   fresh .\\nExcellent sashimi   and the millennium roll is beyond delicious .\\nNot cheap but very yummy .\\nLove it .\\nVery   very nice .\\nThe place is a bit hidden away   but once you get there   it  s all worth it .\\nnot only is the food .\\nLoved It .\\nMy wife and I went to Water  s Edge for a romantic dinner .\\nWe had a very nice time .\\nThe waiter was attentive   the food was delicious and the views of the city were great .\\nI  d definitely go back again .\\nGreat place to relax and enjoy your dinner .\\nThere is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week .\\nPlace is open till late   no dress code .\\nGood food   my favorite is the seafood spaghetti .\\nHighly recommended  \\nExcellent food for great prices .\\nMy husband and I have been sold on this from the first visit .\\nThe wait staff is very courteous and accomodating .\\nThe space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes  1 hour   but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indochinese food .\\nThere are no negatives to speak of .\\nthe bestt  \\nmy favorite place lol .\\ni love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good .\\nits alright .\\nim not necessarily fanatical about this place   but it was a fun time for low pirces .\\nlobster was good   nothing spectacular .\\nits just a fun place to go   not a five star restaraunt .\\nWay below average .\\nI think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked .\\nHad no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive .\\nWould NEVER go back .\\nI love this place .\\nI was n t here for the pizza so I ca n t comment on that yet but what I had was very good .\\nThe service was quick and friendly .\\nEveryone was smiling so that made me feel welcome .\\nI thought the restaurant was nice and clean .\\nI ordered the vitello alla marsala and I was pretty impressed .\\nThe veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly .\\nThe potato balls were not dry at all ... in fact it was buttery .\\nThe only downside ... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time .\\nI  ll be back for sure .\\nWORST PLACE ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN .\\nVery immature bartender   didnt know how to make specific drinks   service was so slowwwww   the food was not fresh or warm   waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers .\\nI would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner .\\nawesome .\\nthe food is always fresh ... .\\noverpriced japanese food with mediocre service .\\nWent here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed .\\nChicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top  \\nfood was luke warm .\\nThe waitress was not attentive at all .\\nI was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have .\\nToo many other good places to have to settle .\\nNot because you are `` The Four Seasons   ...  you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner .\\nThe food was excellent as well as service   however   I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed .\\nI do not think dinner in Manhattan should cost $ 400.00 where I am not swept off my feet .\\nRed Dragon Roll  my favorite thing to eat   of any food group  hands down .\\nJust go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll .\\nIf you do n t like it   I do n t know what to tell you .\\nThe Seafood Dynamite is also otherworldly .\\nI  m not even going to bother to describe it ; it speaks for itself .\\nFavorite Sushi in NYC .\\nI have eaten at some of the ` best   sushi joints in NYC LRB Nobu   Bond Street   JewelBako   etc RRB and Yamato is my favorite .\\nAn unpretentious spot in Park Slope   the sushi is consistently good   the service is pleasant   effective and unassuming .\\nIn the summer months   the back garden area is really nice .\\nThe rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food .\\nThe Dancing   White River and Millenium rolls are musts .\\nSO GOOD .\\nI CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE ... RRB .\\nGross food  Wow  .\\nI ca n t remember the last time I had such gross food in New York .\\nMy quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a threeyear old with no sense of proportion or flavor .\\nAnd $ 11 for a plate of bland guacamole  \\nCome on .\\nDo n t get me started on the margaritas   either .\\nMine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .\\nReally   I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds  this   in the city of a million restaurants   at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one .\\nSave your money and your time and go somewhere else .\\nOh   and I never write reviews  I just was so moved by how bad this place was   I felt it was my duty to spread the word .\\nGreat Indian Food  \\nThis place was reccomended to me by a friend .\\nWhen I got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly .\\nThe food was good   the place was clean and affordable .\\nI noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place  \\nThis is one of my favorite spot   very relaxing the food is great all the times   celebrated my engagement and my wedding here   it was very well organized .\\nThe staff is very good .\\nLove their drink menu .\\nI highly recommend this beautiful place .\\nNice for one time special occasion .\\nWent for Mom  s birthday brunch/lunch .\\nThey honored reservation on Sunday afternoon very well .\\nBe aware .\\nWe were offered water for the table but were not told the Voss bottles of water were $ 8 a piece .\\nFood was OK .\\nNice view of river and NYC .\\nI come here enjoy very much with husband .\\nRemind me of home .\\nGreat survice .\\nMMMMMMMMMmmmmmm so delicious .\\nA beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night .\\nWatch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that  s more lemony than smoky .\\nOh   and there  s hookah .\\nRaymond the bartender rocks  \\nPacifico is a great place to casually hang out .\\nThe drinks are great   especially when made by Raymond .\\nThe omlette for brunch is great ... .\\nthe spinach is fresh   definately not frozen ... .\\nquacamole at pacifico is yummy   as are the wings with chimmichuri .\\nA weakness is the chicken in the salads .\\nIt  s just average   just shredded   no seasoning on it .\\nAlso   I personally was n t a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole .\\nOverall   decent food at a good price   with friendly people .\\nBest Indian Restaurant in the City .\\nDecor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing  \\nThis small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York .\\nSmall   bright   and clean   BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints   both in Astoria and out .\\nWhat really makes it shine is the food   which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices   and all made inhouse LRB even the gyro meat and sausages RRB   and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .\\nAll the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent   but the gyro is the reason to come  if you do n t eat one your trip was wasted .\\nBest restaurant in Brooklyn .\\nThe best  \\nGreat food   amazing service   this place is a class act .\\nThe veal was incredible last night .\\nFresh   mind blowing flavors .\\nThis place is a must visit  \\nYou want to have a real hot dog in Brooklyn  \\nSkip Nathan  s ... you can get that at the mall ... go to Bark .\\nDelicious   creative and fun .\\nGot a date ...

from our guests .\\nEveryone raved about the atmosphere LRB elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views RRB and the fabulous food  \\nService was wonderful ; .\\neveryone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .\\nPaul   the maitre d    was totally professional and always on top of things .\\nThank you everyone at Water  s Edge .\\nRuth   mother of the Bride .\\nwould NOT go back .\\nService ok but unfriendly   filthy bathroom .\\nThe high prices you  re going to pay is for the view not for the food .\\nThe bar drinks were Eh   ok to say the least .\\nThe stuff tilapia was horrid ... tasted like cardboard .\\nWe thought the dessert would be better   Wrong  \\n$ 170 down the toilet ... .\\noh speaking of bathroom   the mens bathroom was disgusting .\\nThe floor was wet   the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor   no soap   and no hand towels left .\\nGo to son cubano in edgewater nj instead .\\nGood Experience .\\nDuring our trip to NYC   we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the Four Seasons for their pretheater menu LRB offering a modified menu for $ 65 pp RRB .\\nThe wine list was extensive  though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings .\\nThe bread we received was horrible  rock hard and cold  and the `` free   appetizer of olives was disappointing .\\nHowever   our main course was wonderful .\\nI had fish and my husband had the filet  both of which exceeded our expectations .\\nThe dessert LRB we had a pear torte RRB was good  but   once again   the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .\\nWhen we inquired about ports  the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .\\nNot what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location .\\nAll in all   I would return  as it was a beautiful restaurant  but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .\\nshort and sweet  seating is great   it  s romantic   cozy and private .\\nThe boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they  re perfect for 2 people .\\nThe service was extremely fast and attentive LRB thanks to the service button on your table RRB but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .\\nThe food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy .\\nover .\\nOver all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .\\nSo what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food .\\nWill probably not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once .\\nImpressed ... .\\nSubtle food and service .\\nNoodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy .\\nServers are all different   Greg is my favorite .\\nSometimes tables do n t understand his sense of humor but it  s refreshing to have a server who has personality   professionalism   and respects the privacy of your dinner .\\nThis is the first place I  ve been that a runner remembers my order ... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant .\\nPrices are fair across the board for both food and bev .\\nI go out to eat and like my courses   servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .\\nRestaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place .\\namazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings  \\nthis place had ALL the trimmings and i mean all .\\npeppers   onions   relish   chilli   cheeses   you NAME it .\\namazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out  \\nBEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE  \\nStepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York  \\nHighly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had  \\nThe have a great cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for  \\nFood took some time to prepare   all worth waiting for .\\nWe were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .\\nI never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending  \\nGreat find in the West Village  \\nMaggot in the food  \\nI  ve been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table .\\nThe menu looked great   and the waiter was very nice   but when the food came   it was average .\\nNevertheless   I finished my plate   and that  s when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .\\nI showed it to the manager   and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts LRB but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for RRB .\\nWhen the bill came   nothing was comped   so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine   but I did n t think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .\\nYes   I ate the food   but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating   and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach .\\nThe manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine LRB which cost less than the food RRB   and made it seem like a big concession .\\nWe paid and left because we did n t feel like arguing any more .\\nI have worked in restaurants and cook a lot   and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .\\nFor a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed   there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .\\nA fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes   Flatbush Farm is n t in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world   but it  s pretty good   albeit with a somewhat dismal setting .\\nUnhygienic .\\nI do not recommend .\\nI went there 2times .\\nI got hair in my food 2 times of then  \\nGreat place   great value .\\nThe food is flavorful   plentiful and reasonably priced .\\nThe atmosphere is relaxed and casual .\\nIt  s a great place to order from or sitin .\\nAwesome .\\nInexpensive   unassuming   great time  \\nSushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance .\\nTry it  \\nVery pleased .\\nGood creative rolls  \\nYamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi   or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much .\\nThey have great rolls   the triple color and norwegetan rolls   are awesome and filling .\\nOne special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up   but save room for dessert  \\nThey have a delicious banana chocolate dessert   as well as a great green tea tempura .\\nThe appetizers are also delicious  \\nAmazing food .\\nMazing interior .\\nGreat food  \\nI  ve had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers .\\nThe atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking   which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .\\nIf you  re into being lost when you  re just five feet from your table then hey   that  s a good thing .\\nDespite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my goto for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future .\\nAnother review here claimed the prefix was $ 29/per person including sake but it is $ 55 per person not including sake .\\nIndo Chinese food   pretty good ... .\\nNot a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food .\\nThe chicken lollipop is my favorite   most of the dishes LRB I have to agree with a previous reviewer RRB are quite oily and very spicy   espeically the Chilli Chicken .\\nMy mom originally introduced me to this place   but even she LRB being Indian RRB feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .\\nStill we keep going back  RRB .\\nI was speechless by the horrible food .\\nI attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant   and the food was majorly disappointing .\\nRather than eating the meat entree being offered   I requested a vegetarian dish .\\nRather than preparing vegetarian dish   the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables LRB minus sauce   seasoning   or any form or aesthetic presentation RRB .\\nI was so stunned   and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .\\nThis place survives on reputation alone .\\nI will NEVER return .\\nBest In ALL of NYC .\\nThis is the MOST wonderful restaurant in all of New York City   not just Brooklyn ... .\\nfor 7 years they have put out the most tasty   most delicious food and kept it that way ... .\\nnever swaying   never a bad meal   never bad service ... .\\nI  m telling you ... .\\nyou should travel from the Bronx to try it ... .\\ngreat food   great wine list   great service in a great neighborhood ... .\\nso delicious  \\nPatsy  s Pizza = true love .\\nHands down the best pizza on the planet .\\nMy bf and I go to the walkup counter and order a pie .\\nIn about 12 minutes   the thing is gone .\\nNeed I say more  \\ngreat hot dogs ... .\\nthe hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .\\ngreat toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost  \\ngreat taste .\\nGreat   original taste .\\nFor me dishes a little oily   but overall dining experience good .\\nHelpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .\\nThe only thing that strikes you is the decor LRB not very pleasant RRB .\\ngreat food .\\nThis place has great indian chinese food .\\nThe flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal .\\nBe prepared to wait   because the place is pretty tiny .\\nAlso   they do not take credit card so come with cash  \\nEven though the place is not beautiful   the food speaks for itself .\\nBest Indian Chinese in the city   by far  \\nAMAZING MY FAVORITE  \\nI have been living in NYC for bit now and I have to say I love to go out and explore the scene .\\nI came across Village Underground by accident   now I go there all the time .\\nThe martinis are amazing and very fairly priced .\\nTHE SERVICE IS AMAZING   i  ve had different waiters and they were all nice   which is a rare thing in NYC .\\nThe DJ is awesome   I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back .\\nYou can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they do n t make you by bottles .\\nWhich lets face it ... at times it  s a good thing .\\nIn the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME  \\nHighly recommended  \\nOne of the best   if not THE best   restaurants in Park Slope LRB and NY in general RRB .\\nEverything on the menu is great .\\nThis establishment is the real deal .\\nWish NY had more of these kind of places   intimate   superb food   homey   top notch all the way around   certainly worth the wait .\\nThere is `` Expensivebutworthit   and there is `` ExpensiveandWTF    \\nThis is a twentysomething guy that does n t mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions .\\nBut $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n t include Wine  \\nAre you freaking kidding me  \\nLook   the appetizers were really good .\\nThe entree was also very good .\\nCa n t argue about that   but they are clearly over priced .\\nWhat you are paying for is the environment and the name .\\nYes   the place is classy and beautiful   but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .\\n$ 500 included   .\\nDrinks   2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $ 35 each .\\nStarters   Kobe Beef Sashimi .\\nWhich of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef .\\nSurprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe .\\nA beef Consomme .\\nEntrees   Vanison steak and Bison Steak .\\nVanison was good but not amazing .\\nBison was quite excellent however .\\nDessert   pure disaster .\\nJust not good at all .\\nSome Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all .\\nI read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself   but may be it is worth it .\\nI was wrong .\\nThe Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants   but trust me   they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say `` I  ve been to the four seasons restaurant   .\\nI wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly   curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it .\\nAll in all   the food was great LRB except for the dessserts RRB .\\nThe environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .\\nIf you are going for the food   it will not be worth it .\\nYes   it is good   but I  ve had better for cheaper .\\nYou would think they would make up for it with service   sadly   no .\\nService was just ok   it is not what you  d expect for $ 500 .\\nTerrible Waste of money ... scammers .\\nI agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience  \\nBUT not in a good way .\\nI am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .\\nI literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .\\nWe went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different .\\nOur visit their to say the least   was an unpleasant and costly experience  \\nAnd even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .\\nWe did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table .\\nAlthough we were told 1015 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .\\nWe were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .\\nThe place is beautiful  \\nThe hostess was very pleasant .\\nHowever   our $ 14 drinks were were horrible  \\nOnce we finally got a table   despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed  \\nSince we were already waiting so long   we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .\\nOur experience did not ever get any better .\\nFor each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .\\nWe also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka .\\nAfter the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .\\nWe asked for beverages and never received them .\\nWe asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .\\nMy chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .\\nI would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .\\nBy the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka  \\nWhat we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka ... some of which we never received  \\nThe only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses  \\nTo top it all off ... the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .\\nBy the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner   which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers  \\nIf it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible  \\nI have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused   and wasted my hard earned money .\\nMY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly  \\nI wish I COULD be refunded  \\nDo n t go with a larger group than 4  \\nI went here for a family birthday dinner .\\nFive of us walked in at approximately 6 20 on a Thursday evening .\\nThe hostess said `` Wow that  s a large group   unless you are n t together     to which I replied `` no we are   and there will be one more   so a table for six please .  \\nAt first we were a little taken aback   as this seemed to present a problem   although the restaurant looked fairly empty   but they hastily put the table together for us .\\nThe menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .\\nThere was no tap beer that evening   which was a disappointment .\\nNot much of a selection of bottled beer either   we went with Brahma .\\nThe appetizers we ordered were served quickly  an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion LRB maybe 3 of each RRB .\\nThe lobster knuckles LRB special of the day RRB were ok   but pretty tasteless .\\nI believe there were 2 shrimp in the `` salt encrusted shrimp   appetizer .\\nAfter we ate our appetizers LRB which took all of 8 minutes RRB we ordered another round of Brahma  s  and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member .\\nThe waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order .\\nWe replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay .\\nShe replied `` well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now   since you are a larger party   and it might get crowded .  \\nWe called the other person who was very close by   and she told us to order for her   so we did .\\nThe food arrived in about 15 minutes .\\nI had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass ... which was very good .\\nEveryone seemed generally happy with their food   except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi   seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice  \\nI heard the lobster roll was excellent .\\nThey seemed to continue to rush us along   taking plates without asking if we were done LRB my sister still had her fork in hand RRB .\\nAll in all the food was good  a little on the expensive side   but fresh .\\nService not the friendliest to our `` large party    \\nProbably would not go back here .\\nGreat Indian food .\\nI lived on 50th st   and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out .\\nFood was amazing  I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly   but I can say this is one of the best I  ve had .\\nVery `` normal Indian food     but done really well .\\nI have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price LRB just chicken tikka masala  no bread of rice  is $ 25 RRB   which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does n t have an upscale feel .\\nAlso   waiters try to push more food on you   like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .\\nI do n t appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron  s knowledge so that was a huge turnoff LRB more than the price RRB .\\nBut if you  re prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary   then this is the place to go for Indian food .\\nOne of the BEST .\\nBukhara Grill   the tagline says it all ... `` INDIAN SPICE RAVE   .\\nMy GF and I dine at Bukhara often as she lives near it .\\nThe lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .\\nWe go often for lunch and the place is packed .\\nWe have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given .\\nBukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC .\\nWretched and retching .\\nThis will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life .\\nThey have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant .\\nI have never been so disgusted by both food an service .\\nFor starters they delivered us someone else  s order .\\nFine   I wont hang you for that .\\nHowever   once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair   LRB sometimes you have to settle when it  s your only option RRB   I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting   slimy   clearly bad piece of fish skin .\\nNot one to jump to complaints LRB hence my lack of previous online reviewing RRB   I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .\\nMy main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others   but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .\\nNone was made so i hung up .\\nLess than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet .\\nMy girlfriend   being slightly more aggressive   and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal   called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster   and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .\\nNot only have I worked in restaurants for many years   I am now in culinary school   I am a huge lover of oysters and fish   and my girlfriend is half Korean  \\nWe know the difference between and oyster and bad fish .\\nIt was n t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand   but now it  s simply repulsive .\\nEat at your own risk .\\nGorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner .\\nI took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night .\\nI book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .\\nThe service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing  \\nI completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date .\\nMore Williamsburg Garbage .\\nMy wife and I visited Dokebi tonight .\\nWe ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgibokum .\\nThe dishes came out around 5 minutes apart .\\nThe bibimbap was average   but the stone bowl was n t even close to sizzling .\\nToo bad I had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .\\nThe nakgibokum was horrible .\\nEasily the worst stirfried squid I  ve ever tasted .\\nThe sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean .\\nThe side dishes were passable   and I did get a refill upon request .\\nThe real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service .\\nI mentioned the squid dish was n t very good when the waitress visited .\\nShe just nodded and walked off .\\nThere were no communications issues either   as she spoke perfect English .\\nAs to my comment about the food   no apology or acknowledgment was made .\\nMy wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .\\nWe were charged full price .\\nIf you ware looking for Korean fusion   I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village .\\nAuthentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street   of course .\\nLives up to the hype .\\nWe  ve lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there .\\nWe  ve tried before but it always packed and does n t take reservations .\\nIt was well worth the wait .\\nThe wife had the risotto which was amazing .\\nIt does n t look appetizing as it  s covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black   but the taste was phenomenal .\\nThe farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .\\ni love margherita pizza  i looove east village pizza .\\nLove this place   every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go .\\nA quintessential slice of NYC pizza .\\nThe crust has a great bite and a good chew   the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it   the salt from the cheese is great   really heightens the flavor of all the other components .\\nPersonally I like the margherita pizza better   but they are all good .\\nPossibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City .\\nThis is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie LRB that do n t serve sushi RRB   and in my opinion   one of the most romantic restaurants in the city  \\nNot only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot   once you enter the unmarked wooden doors   the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you  re no longer in the city .\\nIf you  re planning to come here   make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you  ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching LRB choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky   RRB\\nIt  s just you and your date and an occasional cute ` excuse me   before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth  \\nMy party had the BBE $ 29 fixe prix menu   which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake  \\nI never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it .\\nWe started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .\\nOur first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce .\\nI picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree   which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better .\\nThe entrees were served with miso soup and rice .\\nThe sake  s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .\\nFor desserts   we tried the frozen black sesame mousse LRB interesting but not extraordinary RRB and matcha LRB powdered green tea RRB and blueberry cheesecake   which was phenomenal .\\nMaybe it was the great company LRB I had friends visiting from Philly  yes   it was not a date this time RRB or the super reasonable price point   but I just ca n t say enough good things about this brasserie .\\nI do n t usually visit the same establishment more than once   what more twice   but I  ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet   unhurried and memorable dinner .\\nTerrible would be a compliment  \\nThe service leaves much to be desired   from feeling like you are rushed the place your order   to being ignored the rest of the night .\\nWe were 10 people celebrtating a birthday   we sat in the tent .\\nWe paid a fixed pricce but got nothing  \\nWe never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .\\nThey are extremely rude   not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread  \\nStay away .\\nGreat Shabu Shabu .\\nI go here at least once every other week   particularly when it  s cold  \\nI love it .\\nTo be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu .\\nI tried a couple other dishes but was n t too impressed .\\nBut for the Shabu Shabu   you wo n t find much better in NY .\\nIn fact there is only one I  ve tried that even compares LRB shabu Tatsu RRB and even then I prefer Dokebi .\\nThe meat is fresh   the sauces are great   you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .\\nDokebi gives Williamsburg the right onetwo punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .\\nThe hot dogs are good   yes   but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich   perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .\\nRestaurant with a view .\\nCelebrated my fathers birthday here .\\nThe food tasted very good .\\nThe family seafood entree was very good .\\nThe main entree was also very good .\\nWe order a bit of everything on the menu .\\nPrice is high but the food is good   so I would come back again .\\nThis place does n t make any sense .\\nJust want to warn you all  do n t waste your time and money .\\nThis place has totally weird decor   stairs going up with mirrored walls  I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs  mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ... .\\nThis place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .\\nThe concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n t work .\\nThe food they serve is not comforting   not appetizing and uncooked .\\nGo to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place  this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake .\\nGood Food .\\nI went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary .\\nThe food was great and tasty   but the sitting space was too small   I do n t like being cramp in a corner .\\nOver all it was a very nice romantic place .\\nI would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation LRB if possible RRB .\\nLoved it .\\nA coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it .\\nThe atmosphere was great .\\nThe food we ordered was excellent   although I would n t say the margaritas were anything to write home about .\\nOur waitress was n t mean   but not especially warm or attentive either .\\nI must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year   though .\\nMaybe it has improved since then  \\nRegardless   we  ll be back and ca n t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .\\nDumbfoundingly Poor .\\nThis was   from start to finish   a mindbogglingly uncomfortable experience .\\nLexicographers take note   a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn .\\nThe servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .\\nPolite acknowledgement is out ; .\\nsupercilious scorn is in .\\nAnd how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins   inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent  \\nA different server enhanced the fun   dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer LRB which was delicious RRB .\\nOverall the food quality was pretty good   though I hear the salmon is much better when it has n t sat cooling in front of the guest .\\nThe place has a nice fitout   some attractive furnishings and   from what I could tell   a reasonable wine list LRB I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins RRB .\\nAt $ 120 for two people   however   this in no way represents value   unless you  re looking to pay by the hour for passiveaggressive torture .\\nOn that scale   it  s a worldbeater .\\nHow is this palce still open  \\nI honestly do n t even know where to begin .\\nMy boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers   and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms .\\nWe arrived and were seated immediately   which made us both happy .\\nWe ordered our appetizers   I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .\\nEverything was going good until we got our meals .\\nI took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .\\nIt was served with skin   over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .\\nMy boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead   while he deskinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat .\\nI took one bite from the $ 24 salmon   and I have never   in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy   as dry   and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .\\nAt this point   the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay   I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n t say anything   and guess what   the waitress WALKED away .\\nSo   I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again   but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .\\nI could n t even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .\\nI  ve had better chicken at BBQs  \\nSo I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .\\nGuess what   I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did   she says   `` oh well   I wish you would have said something earlier   No apology   nothing .\\nAfter that she simply took our plates   walked away   came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it  \\nNo desert menu   no apology   nothing  \\nI was literally going to explode   but instead   my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager .\\nThis is where it really really gets bad   the manager said   there is absolutely nothing we can do   it  s a matter of taste that she did n t like it   and I can not comp it .\\nAgain   no apology   no is there anything else I can get you   no can I get you a drink to make up for it   nothing  \\nWe refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore .\\nThe level of rudeness was preposterous .\\nThe manager came to the table and said we can do what we want   so we paid for what we did enjoy   the drinks and appetizers   and walked out .\\nI HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE .\\nTHIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .\\ncirspy crust margherita pizza .\\nwe have been there 3 times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes .\\nit was really good pizza .\\nthe crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded  RRB  RRB  RRB .\\nyou know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review .\\nSingle Worst Restaurant in Manhattan .\\nI  ll being with a couple of positives   cool decor   good pita and hummus   and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .\\nMoving on .\\nIf I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place .\\nCasa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian .\\nThe reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .\\nWell ... they can run but they ca n t hide .\\nI live in the West Village and I  ve been to a lot of restaurants .\\nSometimes you pay a lot and do n t get much in return  it  s manhattan   things are expensive .\\nHowever   most of them are at least prompt and pleasant .\\nThis place ... god where do i begin .\\nIt is quite a spectacular scene i  ll give them that .\\nThe decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n t notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME  \\nHow this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy   or any other for that matter   is beyond me .\\nGreat Hot Dogs  \\nI  ve made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby LRB I live on UWS RRB .\\nThough it  s been crowded most times I  ve gone here   Bark always delivers on their food .\\nThe hot dogs are top notch   and they  re Slamwich is amazing  \\nGoing to Bark is always worth the train ride   and will make your tongue and belly very happy  \\nOnly complaint is the pricing  I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .\\nBut nonetheless  great spot   great food .\\nFabulous food  if the front of house staff do n t put you off  .\\nWe live nearby BFC .\\nIt  s a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions   but we  ve eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .\\nEach time we  ve been   the front of house staff LRB not the waiters  they  re fantastic  but the people who greet and seat you RRB has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .\\nAs BFC does n t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar  and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated   which can be over an hour later  \\nThe frizzy retro girl LRB with winged / Dame Edna glasses RRB will yell at you if you try to order a drink .\\nI was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she `` had a BBQ to go to   that night  WTF  \\nI  d be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely  \\nThere  s another girl who I ca n t describe   she is about 5   6   with brown hair   who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in  except she only hears the last part of what you said   so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you  re * really * talking about .\\nI  m a friendly person   so I would n t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .\\nAgain   I  d be super upset if that were my employee .\\nConsidering you will spend at least $ 60 a head   I expect better service .\\nSo   if you  re walking by and thinking about dining   you might want to see who  s going to be seating you first ... .\\nMaitreD  `` Eat and get out   .\\nMy family ate here last weekend .\\nThe food and service were fine   however the maitreD was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .\\nWhile finishing our meals which included a highend bottle of wine   our son  s fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .\\nThis guy refused to seat her and she left   followed shortly by the four of us   but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel   including Paris   that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .\\nHis response was smug   arrogant   and condescending   totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .\\nA word to the wise   you ca n t dine here and disturb the maitreD  s sense of   table turnover     as whacked as it is   or else .\\nIf you go here   do it on his offnight .\\nBest meal in a long time  \\nMussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening .\\nI had the Lamb special which was perfect .\\nMy father had the flank steak which was very good   and my mother had the swordfish .\\nThe Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience .\\nThe food is great and the environment is even better .\\nEveryone must come here at least once .\\nHighly recommend it  \\nTaking Hot Dogs to the next level .\\nAt first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint   but at Bark you do n t just get your average hot dog .\\nHere the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .\\nGreat Atmosphere .\\nWent to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal .\\nI highly recommend the fish tacos   everything else was ok .\\nCool atmosphere   the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .\\nPoor service and management .\\nDo n t go to this place  \\nHad an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner .\\nAppetizers took nearly an hour .\\nWhen the main course finally arrived LRB another 45mins RRB half of our order was missing .\\nNever got an explanation as to what was going on .\\nThe manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .\\nWhen we threatened to leave   we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing .\\nOn the way out   we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .\\nCa n t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .\\nWhat a hassle  \\nThe food is very good   but not outstanding .\\nThere is no way it justifies the accolades it receives   the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .\\nOn our last visit   they skipped over our name on the list   leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .\\nMistakes happen   but they are usually accompanied by an apology   perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff .\\nWithout the wait or attitude   I would probably go back   but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and do n t make me jump through hoops .\\nExpensive .\\nI went there after hearing how great it was .\\nWow .\\nThe bread was stale   the salad was overpriced and empty .\\nThe pasta was well cooked   did n t have enough sauce though or flavor .\\nI though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far .\\nSo rude  \\nI went with JWILS .\\nHer review is above .\\nI was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .\\nMy friend is 100   right in the experience we had .\\nThe hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .\\nThe only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .\\nI asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane .\\nI was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said   `` can I help you   and `` how many are in your party .  \\nWhat  \\nThe three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .\\nWe did n t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem .\\nShame on this place for the horrible rude staff and nonexistent customer service .\\nbad staff .\\nI generally like this place .\\nThe food is good .\\nThe design of the space is good .\\nBut the service is HORRID  \\nI was there for brunch recently   and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .\\nThe waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .\\nI ca n t believe that it was   but please put the bag down before delivering food  \\nThe waitress came to check in on us every few minutes   and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating LRB a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere   so I try to ignore it RRB .\\nI could n t ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends   who was in mid bite   to clear the table .\\nShe then put the check down without asking if we were done   and came to check on the bill every two minutes   even though we were one of three occupied tables .\\nI wish I could like this place more   and I wish someone would retrain the staff .\\nYum  \\nServes really good sushi .\\nNot the biggest portions but adequate .\\nGreen Tea creme brulee is a must  \\nDo n t leave the restaurant without it .\\nNo Comparison .\\n I ca n t say enough about this place .\\nIt has great sushi and even better service .\\nThe entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need .\\nI  ve been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date .\\nSnotty Attitude .\\n We were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast .\\nThe owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint .\\nGood food  \\n We love breakfast food .\\nThis is a great place to get a delicious meal .\\nWe never had to wait more than 5 minutes .\\nThe staff is pretty friendly .\\nThe onion rings are great  \\nThey are not greasy or anything .\\nOverrated .\\n I was highly disappointed in the food at Pagoda .\\nThe lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns   the few they actually give you ... were not good .\\nThe prices are outrageous   especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood Chinese establishments .\\nNice ambience   but highly overrated place .\\nI will not go back .\\nWorst Service I Ever Had .\\n A group of 5 of us went there for Sunday brunch and sat outside .\\nEveryone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received .\\nOur waiter was nonexistent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered   we were not given any water or utensils .\\nI complained to the manager   but he was not even apologetic .\\nI will never return again .\\nFabulous Italian Food  \\n I highly recommend Mioposto .\\nI am so happy to have a wonderful Italian restaurant in my neighborhood .\\nThe wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to Italy .\\nI love this restaurant .\\n I will never forget the amazing meal   service   and ambiance I experience at this restaurant .\\nIt was absolutely amazing .\\nThe wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse   the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice   good at their jobs and cultured .\\nI have not a bad thing to say about this place .\\nAMAZING .\\nI can not wait to go back again this coming weekend  \\nMmm ... good  \\n Went there last night with a friend .\\nShe had heard from a coworker about this place .\\nThe food was great  \\nIt  s * very * reasonably priced   esp for the quality of the food .\\nI had the Kafta plate and it was perfect .\\nWe  re going back  D .\\nFinally a meal that you will remember for a long time  \\n In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants   its nice to see a place that bucks that trend   and just plain delivers high quality food and good service   period .\\nThis is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer .\\nCaution  its real food for people who love the best .\\nSome of the food is clearly oriented toward foodies LRB like me RRB so if your not a foodie LRB nothing wrong with that RRB  head over to McDonalds or some Ruby Tuesday and have at it  \\nIf your looking for real quality LRB not the BS that is seen on yelp ratings  which allegedly recently got in trouble for `` adjusting   ratings RRB   you need to get in here  \\nVery Disappointing .\\n I took my parents here for their anniversaryvery very disappointed  \\nI liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price .\\nI may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it .\\nRice is too dry   tuna was n t so fresh either .\\nNothing really came across as outstanding .\\nVery disappointed .\\nI have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent .\\nHowever   the value and service are both severely lacking .\\nPortions contain less fish than one would expect   particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in NYC LRB Masa excluded   of course RRB .\\nFurthermore   while the fish is unquestionably fresh   rolls tend to be inexplicably bland .\\nThe service ranges from mediocre to offensive .\\nOn a recent trip   our waiter was extremely dismissive   while no less than three staff members waited handandfoot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby .\\nWe were then charged for their most expensive sake LRB $ 20   per serving RRB when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price .\\nBut Im sure this was just an honest mistake ... .\\nFreshest sushi  I love this restaurant .\\nThey pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls .\\nThe sashimi was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted .\\nTheir apps are all delicious .\\nThe only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side .\\nBut the space is small and lovely   and the service is helpful .\\nYou are bound to have a very charming time .\\nNot recommanded  \\n The food was not great & the waiters were rude .\\nIt is not worth going at all and spend your money there  \\ngreat service .\\n Pretty cheap for sit down Mexican AND downtown .\\nmy service was stellar  \\nthe bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me .\\nfood was fine   with a some littletastierthannormal salsa .\\nIf you  re in the area you should n t be disappointed .\\nOk ...  Maybe I went in on someone  s bad day ... .\\nthe food was great   the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me .\\nTook forever to get our order taken   water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention .\\nI do n t know if I  ll be back ... .\\nMama Mia  I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place .\\nthe only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it  s edible   even when you order ahead .\\nBUt once done   it  s not too much dough   not too much cheese   not too much sauce .\\nBest Sushi in town .\\nHave gone to all the top places .\\nEverything you want and more   very fresh .\\nIts worth the wait   especially since they  ll give you a call when the table is ready .\\nThe best calamari in Seattle  \\n ... and the best summertime deck experience  they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather .\\nA perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year .\\nEndless fun   awesome music   great staff  \\n By far the best bar in the east village ... .\\nI went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast  \\nEvery time `` 0sixtynine   is called the bartender buys everyone drinks  \\nBeen there lots since and its always a good time .\\nGreat draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks .\\nDefinitely has one of the best jukebox  s i  ve seen in a long long time .\\nI FOUND A NEW HOME ON SECOND AVENUE  \\n Where can I begin .\\nI ca n t  \\nJust go there and see for yourself .\\nThe food is great   the bartenders go that extra mile .\\nYou need to watch your game   they will have it on for you .\\nThe owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for .\\nAnd the upstairs is a great place to hang out .\\nNot alot of smoking places left in New York   but I have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city .\\nKudos to these guys .\\nI found a new home and just moved with a long lease .\\nThank you .\\nGo Beyond the California Rolls ... .\\nThe sushi here is delicious  \\nThey have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from ; Atlantic or Pacific .\\nI  ve had the Jellyfish   Horse Mackerel   Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others   and they were all good .\\nMy only negative comment is that I wish the pieces were a little bigger .\\nThe decor is rustic   traditional Japanese .\\nThe crowd is mixed yuppies   young and old .\\nThe service was courteous and attentive .\\nMediocre food .\\n We ate on the outside patio area for dinner on a Saturday night .\\nThe outside patio area has an abbreviated menu .\\nWe ordered the marinated grapes   buffalo style chicken wings   and the turkey sandwich .\\nMy g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price .\\nWe are locals   and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably onetime customer tourists .\\nService was decent .\\nDrinks were good .\\nUnless you are just stopping in for a few drinks I would n t recommend going here .\\nYou are likely to be disappointed .\\nExcellent food   nice ambience   fairly expensive .\\n I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi LRB 5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis RRB and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes .\\nThe ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney .\\nIt was romantic  and even nice even with my sister   reminded me of Italy   and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa .\\nI recommend it for a night when you want to splurge LRB it was a bit expensive RRB  \\nBest Indian food in L.A. .\\n I  ve been to over a dozen Indian places in L.A.   and this is still my favorite .\\nThe best thing is   the prices are also quite reasonable .\\nThe chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes .\\nThe chana masala LRB garbanzo beans RRB are also excellent .\\nIt  s located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center   not the greatest location   but the food keeps me coming back for more .\\nhidden little jem .\\n tucked away over by the Beverly Center .\\nNever too crowded and always great service .\\nI think I have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent .\\nI can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma .\\nYou routinely see Indian families and friends dining there   which is always a good sign .\\nI appreciate their delivery too .\\nNice food but no spice  \\n I really enjoyed my meal here .\\nI had yummy lamb korma   saag paneer   samosas   naan   etc. .\\nThe food was all good but it was way too mild .\\nNormally   places ask how hot you want it   but they did n t .\\nI should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild .\\nI will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches .\\nThe naan was some of the best I  ve had and I really enjoyed the bhartha   not too tomatoey .\\nEven the chickpeas   which I normally find too dry   were good .\\nAnd they packaged everything nicely so it did n t spill .\\nawesome find .\\n I do n t understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long ... the fajita salad   the colorado   the fajitas  EVERYTHING is delicious .\\nI love the warm & cosy environment .\\nI just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party  ca n t wait to celebrate my next birthday there .\\nbest restaurant in the world   great decor   great customer service   friendly manager .\\n first of all henrymillionare you dont know a thing about middle eastern food so dont talk .\\nCry me a river   stop complaining you obviously you have no taste in food .\\ni am never disappointed with there food .\\nthe atmosphere is great .\\nand all you other people that have a problem get some help .\\ngreat lunch spot .\\n Great financial district mexican spot .\\nAlways busy   but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service .\\nEverything I  ve had here is good   taco salads   burritos   enchiladas i love this place .\\nAlso have great margaritas  \\nYou can order to go if you have to get back to the office too  \\nLebanese Food   Yum  \\n I  ve been to Open Sesame only once   but I  m still reeling from the experience  \\nThe food is simply unforgettable  \\nI had the beef kabobs with a side of cucumber yogurt .\\nThe presentation of the food was an added bonus   it looked just as great as it tasted  \\nMy best friend had the chicken shawarma and she STILL raves about it being the best anywhere  \\nHer sister had the baklava for dessert  \\nWhat a tastly   flaky treat  \\nThe staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful .\\nGO TO OPEN SESAME  \\nHoly Hummus  \\n The food is here is incredible   though the quality is inconsistent during lunch .\\nDinners have always been excellent   in terms of food quality .\\nThe open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given .\\nThe side of potatoes is to die for   as is the labne LRB yogurt dip RRB .\\nAlso   they serve THE best hummus in America   with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil LRB which   I believe is the traditional way RRB  \\nThe only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service .\\nThere have been several occasions when we  ve just not gotten some side dishes we  ve ordered .\\nHowever   this place is a gem   and I wo n t stop going back .\\ngreat beer .\\n My first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible  \\nWe waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1\\xa01/2 hours for our food .\\nI swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal .\\nHOWEVER   one Sunday afternoon my husband and I did go LRB although with my loud protests RRB and were pleasantly surprised .\\nThe band was very good and the service was attentive .\\nOutside in the area between the restaurant and the park   children were running around while their parents sipped wine .\\nWe ordered a selection of the small plates   and the shoe string onions   goat cheese pizza   grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good .\\nIt was like dining at a completely different restaurant .\\nWe have since returned and also had a great experience   sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer LRB cold and good RRB .\\nWe did have the same waiter the second time   so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good .\\nSunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun .\\nSeattle  s BEST Winelist .\\n Ray  s LRB suprisingly RRB has the city  s BEST & most diverse wine list .\\nThe sommelier is fantastic   downtoearth   & extremely knowlegable .\\nI would go back for the wine experience alone .\\nNice job  \\nNOT THE PLACE IT ONCE WAS .\\n It is sad to see a place that was once `` THE   place to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch   now be the place that is a big `` DONT BOTHER .  \\nThe food is not what it once was LRB potions have seriously seen downsizing RRB prices have gone up   and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere LRB including mainland Europe RRB .\\nWhat may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment .\\nThis establishment really made a marked decline after LRB and this is recurring story RRB the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS `` DINERS   DRIVEINS   AND DIVES   hosted by Guy Fieri   in which Schooner or Later was subject of .\\nPerhaps now   Scooner or Later falls into the `` Dive   category .\\nThis is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat .\\nI hope one day Scooner or Later returns to what it once was .\\nUntill this happens   my advice is to STAY AWAY .\\nOpen & Cool Place with the Best Pizza and Coffee .\\n Mioposto has a very creative & delicious pizza menu .\\nThe coffe is very good   too .\\nGreat open and friendly ambience .\\nThis place is charming and relaxing .\\nThe servers behind the counter are always friendly and helpful .\\nIt reminds me of those great little restaurants in San Francisco .\\nIt  s a great place to enjoy food and meet friends .\\nOld Reliable .\\n After 12 years in Seattle Ray  s rates as the place we always go back to .\\nGreat food   spectacular location   and friendly service keep us coming back year after year .\\nEnjoyed the food .\\n First of all   I am not from Long Beach .\\nI was visiting SoCal a couple of months ago when the friend I was visiting decided to take me to this restaurant .\\nLRB She was actually going to take me to another mediterranean restaurant right across the street but they were not open yet even though it was a few minutes past their opening time . RRB\\nI liked it .\\nFood was good and cheap .\\nI had the kafta plate and I enjoyed it .\\nIt was so much though that I could barely finish but I did   since it was delicious .\\nAtmosphere was nice .\\nService was kind of slow   our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it was n t that busy .\\nStill I would recommend this place .\\nBTW   I really like Long Beach .\\nIt was one of the few places in SoCal where you would actually walk around and not have to take a car .\\nWOW  \\n IT CANT GET ANY BETTER  \\nWHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY NICE PEOPLE AMAZING FOOD WOW .\\nGreat food with an awesome atmosphere  \\n Eggs   pancakes   potatoes   fresh fruit and yogurt  everything they serve is delicious .\\nThe best place for a leisure Sunday breakfast amidst yachts   then take a stroll through the nearby Farmer  s Market .\\ngreat meal  the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent  there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi  this fish was perfect  \\nplus   i am allergic to rice   and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating  did n t even bat an eye  \\nand the waiter suggested a perfect sake  \\nabsolutely fabulous  \\nUnbeatable sushi  \\nTwo thumbs up  \\nI love sushi   and I have eaten it all over the world .\\nThis is right up there with places in Tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned .\\nMelt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi   and very tasty rolls too .\\nBe sure to try the oyster roll .\\nsplendid .\\n How to describe the best sushi in NYC   hmmmm   delicious   amazing   fantastic   suculent   perfect   nah   all of the above .\\nI ca n t saybenough good things about this restaurant   and I ca n t wait for my next several visits .\\nThe best Chuwam Mushi I have ever had .\\nPerfect on a cold day .\\n$ 6 with tip .\\nPerfection .\\nGood Sushi   High Price .\\nOne of the best Sushi place in town .\\nThe house special roll is really good .\\nOn weekends   you might have to wait for couple hours .\\nHowever   they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone .\\nA cozy spot for 2 .\\n I ca n t believe Murphy  s has been around for over 25 years   amazing .\\nThat  s a huge compliment   especially in the fickled restaurant business   ... enough already  \\nBrunch at Murphy  s is to die for   my specialty ... egg white omelet   the food is always freshly prepared .\\nIt  s the perfect spot for a romantic date for 2 or a secret rendezvous  \\nSave room for scrumptious desserts .\\nThe restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you wo n t forget  \\nI guarantee you wo n t be disappointed   there  s also valet parking .\\nAddicting  \\n Best Mexican place for lunch in the financial district .\\nLove the enchiladas and chicken soup  and be sure to check out their specials .\\nThe cooks have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes .\\nCan get busy on Fridays for a table but once seated   the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly .\\nI went there with a friend from out of town ... and we were both very impressed  \\nWent on a Monday night   so there was no wait for a table .\\nThe sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick .\\nThe price was right too .\\nThe atmosphere was just okay .\\nSpace was limited   but the food made up for it .\\nI  d go back there in a heartbeat .\\nShould have gone to Trader Joe  s and had frozen pizza  LRB .\\n My family went on a midweek evening to have dinner .\\nThe restaurant was 80   full and there was a sign posted `` wait to be seated .  \\nWell I guess it  s hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff .\\nWe stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us .\\nFinally   my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked   `` Are you waiting for a table    \\nOnce seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal .\\nThe prior reviews said Kid friendly ... give me a break with two young children that is light years .\\nThe Caesar salad I ordered had so much lemon I could n t eat it .\\nThe pizza was slightly reminescent of Baker  s Beach pizza which occupied the the space years ago LRB a distant second RRB .\\nIt was decent but nothing exceptional .\\nThis establishment is consistent with my feelings of the rest of Chow Foods group .\\nWe used to frequent most of their restaurants but over the years each one has really been disapointing .\\nI  m a born and bred Southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening .\\nWell   I guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management to pay a visit to Tutta Bella in Columbia City for some tips .\\nGreat food   better Margaritas  \\n This is one of my top lunch spots   huge portions   fast service and amazing margaritas  \\nit gets really busy   so get there on the early side so you can grab a seat   if you do have to wait   its not bad because the service is quick  \\nCheck out the art on the walls   very colorful  \\ni love this place  \\n i have been eating at this place for over 8 years now and i have never had one bad meal .\\ni highly recommend this place to all that want to try indain food for the first time .\\nThe lunch menu is an awesome deal  \\nplenty of food   trust me .\\nFresh ingrediants and super tasty .\\nThe place is the next best thing to my Moms cooking .\\nBest food   phenominal service .\\nFor the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best NYC has to offer   the fish is the freshest and the service is superb .\\nNot only can the selection be innovative   but there  s a nice balance of traditional sushi as well .\\nThe nicest waiters in town .\\nWAY OVERRATED  \\n This place is unbelievably overrated .\\nIf I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average brunch food   then I would put Murphy  s at the top of the list .\\nThe regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive .\\n10  \\nYour a sushi fan   you love expertly cut fish   great sake   a killer SOHO location   and of course   Salmon   Tuna   Fluke   Yellow Tail   Cod   Mackeral   Jellyfish   Sea Urchin   Shrimp   Lobster   Sea Bream   Trout   Milk Fish   Blue Fin Tuna   Eel   Crab   Sardine   Monk Fish   Roe   Scallop   Oysters   and a varity of Toro .\\nThere is only one place on the east coast that has it all   plus a lot more .\\nBetter than nobu   tomoe   taka   yama   sugiyama   and the rest .\\nBring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world   BLUE RIBBON SUSHI .\\nBelieve it baby  \\nCut to the chase  this is amazing  \\nIt  s unpretentious and underground .\\nIt  s fresh   welcoming   delicious   and relaxing .\\nHands down   the best tuna I have ever had .\\nBlue Ribbon lives up to it  s fantastic reputation .\\nI went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again .\\nWhat a find  \\nWell worth it .\\nGreat value sushi with high quality & nice setting .\\nGood for late night dining LRB last minute planning RRB without reservations .\\nTry the Chef  s Choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty .\\nPoor customer service / poor pizza .\\n As with most restaurants in Seattle   Mioposto  s service was bad and the food was overpriced .\\nI know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places   but Mioposto  s pizza lacks quality and good taste .\\nTo be honest   I  ve had better frozen pizza .\\nI  m not kidding .\\nThe only positive thing about Mioposto is the nice location .\\nLove it every time .\\nI was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews  this place is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way   and we  ve eaten here more than 10 times .\\nPeople complain about the dim lighting   but that is one what I love about this place  if you want to stare at your food in bright light   go to McDonalds .\\nThe food is fantastic   and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we  ve been there .\\nThe only problem would be the wait   but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting .\\nNever had one single problem there .\\nSeafood Plus .\\n This was great dining experience .\\nIf you  re going to see Danny Gans or just staying at the Mirage   do n t miss this one .\\nThe appetizer of oysters   lobster   crab LRB small size RRB made a perfect entre for my wife .\\nSeabass on lobster risotto was the best .\\nCaesar salad was superb .\\nGreat bottle of wine .\\nLeave room for dessert .\\nCOMPLETELY OVER RATED  \\nI will have to do more research before checking out new places based on Diners   driveins and dives reviews .\\nI noice most reviews mention the bad service .\\nThe food was ok   but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served .\\nEven then   the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items .\\nWe had a very hard time getting the waitress   attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .\\nAs it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20   discount on our bill .\\nWhen the bill came   he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks .\\nIt was clear he did n t really care .\\nWith so many great breakfast/lunch places in So Cal   this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit .\\nAVOID THE PLACE .\\n Save yourself the waste of time & DO NOT visit .\\nI made my 1st trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online .\\nWhen I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible  \\nI waited for 1015 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again .\\nAfter sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes I left .\\nI went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that does n t work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link .\\nI never heard back from anyone more than a month ago .\\nAfter telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar .\\nAfter sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she  d be right with us .\\nWe left without ever getting service .\\nAs of writing this I just tried their give away a link again & it still does n t work .\\nThere are so many better places to visit  \\nBest Crab Cakes in Town .\\n Thats a big statement considering I  ve been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since I was about seven  but something about these little devils gets better every time .\\nIf you can   come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening .\\nGreat seasonal fish and seafood   with a classy waterfront setting .\\nAlways a winner .\\nGreat Pizza   Poor Service .\\n Love their pizza   especially the mushroom pizza .\\nAlso love their caeser salad .\\nPrefer to order it and pick it up though because I do n t like the servers   one young woman in particular .\\nShe does n t make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance .\\nBut she is very friendly with certain people   making it even more annoying .\\nManagement should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners .\\nMany people talk about the great pizza and poor service   so it ca n t just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers .\\nIt  s a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n t so impersonal and corporatelike .\\nGreat Breakfast .\\n This place is famous for their breakfast .\\nThey have been featured on the food network and they deserve it .\\nThe food is great and they make a mean bloody mary .\\nI love breakfast here .\\nTheir crab eggs benedict is addicting .\\nAll their menu items are a hit   and they serve mimosas .\\nDoes n t get any better than that .\\nbest chinese food i have tasted in a long time .\\n we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night .\\nthere was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area .\\nYou can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing .\\nthe ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning .\\nnot too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up .\\nthe staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese .\\nwe ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food .\\nFirst off   the food came fast and all together  RRB i like that ... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other .\\nso about the prawns   they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty .\\nyummy .\\nbest honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted .\\nnext one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli .\\nthe brocollis were so fresh and tasty .\\ni would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time   every piece was as eventful as the first one ... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked .\\nnot chewy at all .\\nfor desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee ... oh la la yummy  \\nmelt in your mouth .\\nwe are for sure coming back to this restaurant .\\nevery month if possible .\\nit is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel ... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss   esp if your in downtown san jose .\\nChintzy portions .\\n The sushi here is perfectly good   but for $ 5 a piece   either the slices of fish should be larger   or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant LRB even for NYC RRB .\\nWe easily spent more than $ 40 per person LRB not including alcohol RRB and were still hungry .\\nI  m astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ .\\nTerrible service   food ok   pricey .\\n This past weekend had great weather for San Francisco standards .\\nSo for the ` after beach excursion     we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to Park Chalet .\\nThe restaurant was busy   however there were a few tables open .\\nWe put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it  d be a 30 minute wait .\\nSo here we are   my wife   3 year old daughter and I trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building LRB where the murals and artifacts are RRB .\\n30 minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off .\\nWe went back to the restaurant and low and behold   we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago  \\nLogic behind that  \\nNone that I can think of .\\nWe put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers   the food did n t arrive until 45 minutes later ... WITH OUR MAIN COURSE .\\nUm so now what are appetizers for  \\nOh I forgot to mention that they do n t have bread service .\\nIts a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag .\\nMy wife also ordered a teapot of hot water LRB she had a sore throat RRB and I guess that since it was only water   it was n t a priority for them to actually bring it .\\nIn other words   if they are n t making $ $ off of you then you do n t rate high on their ` service scale   .\\nFood wise   its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n t a fancy place .\\nThe upside of the restaurant  \\nIf I needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or Golden Gate park .\\nIts great if you spent the day there and did n t want to drive to eat .\\nParking is reasonably good   they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby .\\nAnother plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides .\\nI  d hate for tourists to go to Park Chalet and think that this is how all San Francisco restaurants are like .\\nAlways good .\\n A sushifiend friend recently visited and our group of three just had to come for dinner .\\n6pm on a Sat before a Broadway play and we were quickly seated and served .\\nAmazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi LRB that eel with avodcao  um um um RRB .\\nAs usual the omikase did n t disappoint in freshness   although it scored low on creativity and selection .\\nTheir specialty rolls are impressive   though I ca n t remember what we had .\\nGreat selection of sakes .\\nGreen tea creme brulee gets better each time I have it .\\nIt is n t the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time .\\nVery poor customer service .\\n Schooner or Later  s charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not   unfortunately   compensate for its very poor customer service .\\nWhile this diner had reasonably good food   the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence   and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service .\\nAs part of a small party of four   our food was dropped off without comment ; .\\nany further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table .\\nWhen we finally were able to flag someone down   it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food   who was also not the same person who had taken our order .\\nAfter one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress   a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant .\\nA brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment  to say we had been `` blown off   would be an understatement .\\nThe manager continually interrupted with `` Is there anything else I can do for you     a strange comment because she had hardly listened   let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .\\nShe promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage   but we could hardly take her promise seriously   seeing as she had n t bothered to get the waitresses name .\\nIn short   Schooner or Later could n t have cared less about our being at their establishment .\\nNext time we will go somewhere else   or try other restaurants close by like Mimi  s Cafe and Claim Jumper .\\n1 o clock in the morning .\\nyou are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi ... then this might be the place .\\nthe fish was fresh   though it was cut very thin .\\ngreat service .\\ngood sake selection .\\nDungeness crabs here  \\n Ray  s is THE place to go for high quality seafood dinners .\\nAnd they give good quantity for the price .\\nWe were only in Seattle for one night and I  m so glad we picked Rays for dinner  \\nI love Dungeness crabs and at Ray  s you can get them served in about 6 different ways  \\nWe shared the family platter and I especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu .\\nI ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting ... yummy  \\nAnd the service was simply spendid  quite a delight .\\nGreat Breakfast .\\n Great drinks   corn beef hash   coffee   B Fast burritos   Gluten Free menu .\\nThe service is fantastic at this fun place .\\nIf there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a place is open   you know it is great .\\nThis is the case at this gem .\\nBest Neighborhood Standby .\\nYou Ca n t Go Wrong Here .\\n Every neighborhood has a few great local bars that are the best secrets .\\nIn Grammercy/Union Square/East Village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot .\\nThe music is great   no night better or worse   the bar tenders are generous with the pouring   and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits .\\nSeriously   you ca n t go wrong   if it is unpretentious local fun you seek .\\nOh   and the cheese fries are awesome  \\nGood Food   Great Service   Average Prices LRB For the Strip RRB .\\n I decided to eat at Stack because of their price fixed preshow dinner .\\nWhen I walked in   I was taken aback by their incredible wood decor .\\nThe music playing was very hip   2030 something pop music   but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat   which became annoying midway through dinner .\\nWe were quickly seated and requested the special dinner   which came with   1 RRB Shellfish and Shrimp appetizer or Caesar Salad   2 RRB 9 oz steak LRB with a single potato chip RRB   and 3 RRB homemade donut holes .\\nI got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright .\\nIt was n t the freshest seafood ever   but the taste and presentation was OK .\\nBefore the steak came   the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested I pick something from the menu .\\nI picked the asparagus   which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared .\\nIt was steamed and tossed with garlic .\\nThe 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great   at least initially .\\nThe steak was done to my exact liking LRB medium rare RRB and was nice and juicy .\\nIt s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction   though both were indistinguishable in taste .\\nThough   one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak .\\nMy mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ... MSG ... taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant .\\nFinally   the homemade donut holes were served for desert .\\nThey came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and nottoosweet .\\nThe desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner .\\nThe dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip   almost $ 50/pp after tax and tip LRB about average RRB .\\nBut the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly .\\nOverall   I would go back and eat at the restaurant again .\\nJust remember to dress a little urbanchic so you don t look too far out of place .\\ngood sake   good food  i honestly do n t know much about japanese food at all .\\nIn the past sake usuallly just tasted kind of like salty water to me .\\nServer made several sake suggestions which were very good .\\nhad many dishes but the BEST was the lobster 3 ways .\\nVERY GOOD  \\nOverpriced .\\n We dined at the Colorado location today .\\nWaited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd .\\nThe waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded .\\nAlso   there was only one bathroom stall  probably need more for such big crowds .\\nMost importantly   we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu .\\nAt best   the food was good and definately overpriced .\\nFor the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower .\\nNot sure if I would go back .\\nMy favortie pizza joint in Seattle .\\n This is my `` must bring out of town guests to   restaurant and they always enjoy and rave about it .\\nIn fact   many want to return a second time during their visit .\\nThe pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic .\\nI  ve always found the wait staff and   if you sit at the bar   the cooks very friendly .\\nThey are n t the most talkative   but everytime I  ve been there they have been very busy   which probably accounts for the lack of conversation .\\nI also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant .\\nIt  s just the right size for the menu .\\nExcellent .\\n My husband and I love eating at Mioposto Café .\\nWe  re ca n t say enough about their delicious gourmet pizza  s  \\nYou wo n t be disappointed by their menu .\\nThe pizza  s are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings .\\nYou never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there .\\nThe pizza  s are light and scrumptious .\\nTry the Pizza Ensalata  \\nIt  s a salad on top of pizza crust .\\nAbsolutely delicious .\\nThe pizza  s are not huge and the crust is thin ... keep that in mind when you  re ordering .\\nWorth the wait .\\n Had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning   but it was so worth it .\\nThe food is sinful .\\nThe staff was really friendly .\\nThe atmosphere was great .\\nThe specialty here is decadent pancakes   but I  ve been back now four times   and I  ve been wowed every time .\\nNothing on the menu is less than amazing .\\nGo with some friends   wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe   and enjoy more than your average breakfast .\\nGood eats .\\nWhose writing all the great reviews  \\nWhy is it that LRB almost RRB every good review is by `` anonymous    \\nI do n t know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place .\\nI have been to this place   folks and it is BAD .\\nMaybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that  s halfway decent .\\nI have been here   spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment .\\nFancy pieces of exotic fish on a $ 100 dollar plate and NOT ONE was eatable .\\nDONOT GO  \\nDelicious .\\n The atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate .\\nThe best dish are the honwy walnut prawns  just outstanding .\\nThe service is really attentive and charming .\\n4 Locations .\\n they have 4 locations .\\nthe 2 listed and then one in Southglenn mall parking lot which is reviewed here and one in Ft Collins .\\nWe waited for an hour to be seated .\\nThe service was excellent   the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding .\\nIt was worth the wait .\\nPlan on waiting 3070 minutes .\\nWill definitely be back .\\nSouthglenn is largest location .\\nDelicious ...  \\n I recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful restaurant on 2nd street and wow what a great evening we had .\\nThe food is fantastic   authentic   delicious and very   very affordable .\\nThe decor was beautiful and unique .\\nThere was a really nice vibe about the place ... good music   atmosphere and happy looking people .\\nOur server was very professional and friendly .\\nTo the owners of Open Sesame ... Bravo ... I ca n t wait to come back to dine at your restaurant  \\nDelectable .\\nIt  s a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend LRB Thurs Sun RRB you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar .\\nOnce you  re inside   the real experience begins .\\nEverything   and I mean everything on the menu is delectable .\\nThe waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .\\nThe sushi is as fresh as it comes you  d think ocean was in their backyard   no joke  \\nIf you  re interested in good tasting LRB without the fish taste or smell RRB   large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place ... .\\nbig thick pepperoni .\\n The pepperoni  s cut real thick  Yum .\\nThe pizza itself is not exactly the best I  ve had EVER   but still pretty good .\\nI probably would n t go back though ` cuz I do n t know if it  s worth it .\\nMaybe I  ll go back once more many years from now when I  ve forgotten I went there already .\\nSit in the Balcony .\\n Not bad .\\nFood was good and appetizing .\\nPortions was just enough for me   but may not be for a big eater .\\nFair menu selection .\\nThe appetizer was interesting   but the Creme Brulee was very savory and delicious .\\nIndoor ambience was modern .\\nIf it  s nice outside   request for a table in the balcony .\\nIt  s a great place to people watch .\\nAlthough the service could be improved considering the money you put in .\\nOur drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times .\\nShould checkup on us more frequently   do n t you think  \\nLate night dinning with exeptional food .\\n I did n t want to go there because of the reviews and prices I saw on the internet .\\nThat was the last night in Vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing  so we walked in the check the place .\\nWe were seated right away   the table was private and nice .\\nThe service was exceptional  sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters .\\nThe food was very good   filet mignon was probably the best I  ve ever try .\\nThe portions are big though   so do not order too much .\\nGroovy music made the dinner casual .\\nThe most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places .\\nI have a but here  there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd .\\nThe bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink   the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .\\nThere were 3 bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink .\\nI felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom .\\nThis place rocks  \\n Mercedes restaurant is so tasty   the service is undeniably awesome  \\nThe chips and salsa are so yummy   and the prices are fabulous .\\nThe atmosphere is aspiring   and the decor is festive and amazing .\\nThe catering is out of this world   and Raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world  \\nDrinks are suberb   and I feel like I am in a Third World country when I walk in the door .\\nInsultingly Overpriced .\\n Mediocre Service/Quality .\\n This review is for the Southglen location which is not listed in Citysearch   I wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but Snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service   so this review as well as the other negative ones for their Larimer location will go unaddressed .\\nThe presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu .\\nTo start off   approximately 810 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 .\\nThey serve it in a tall   skinny hourglass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .\\nI should have just asked for the check when I saw that ; but their menu was so unique that I continued .\\nThe pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3  6   pancakes LRB one of them was more like 5   RRB in the pancake flight LRB sample of 3 different pancakes RRB is well overpriced .\\nThe pancakes should be larger LRB at least 8   RRB to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .\\nThe flavors were good but I have had far better pancakes at a German pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger .\\nOn my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking   and would have had to send them back again if I had n t rejected the meal all together .\\nI rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue .\\nTo their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .\\nIn the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes   a breakfast burrito   an orange juice and an iced tea LRB I had water RRB .\\nThis was 2 times what the same meal would have cost at Le Peep .\\nSnooze provided an inventive pancake offering   but Le Peep would have provided better service and quality .\\nMuch more than just a great view  \\n I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray  s Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations .\\nRay  s is something of a Seattle institution   but given its gorgeous Sound views   I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .\\nImagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the thirdbest thing about Ray  s  \\nTo start things off   our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .\\nMy party of two was feeling particularly ambitious   and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns   smoked albacore tuna   Ray  s fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill   scallops in a tasty soy dressing   and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .\\nFor my entr&eacute;e   I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard   artichoke hearts   fennel   and pecorino toscano .\\nThe scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique LRB not to mention tasty RRB .\\nMy friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .\\nI had a taste of all three items on her plate   and they were superb .\\nOur server continued to be attentive throughout the night   but I did remain puzzled by one issue   Who thinks that Ray  s is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner  \\nTwo rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner ... they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table .\\nGiven that Ray  s is a seafood restaurant ... well   you get the idea ... .\\nAll considered   I have to say that Ray  s Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution .\\nWhile I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us   our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .\\nOh yeah ... the view was good   too .\\nThis computer is absolutely AMAZING \\n10 plus hours of battery...\\nsuper fast processor and really nice graphics card..\\nand plenty of storage with 250 gb though I will upgrade this and the ram.. \\nThis computer is really fast and I m shocked as to how easy it is to get used

drawback.\\nOtherwise  I love it \\nI wasn t really sure I wanted to spend that kind of money \\nIt Was a great deal after all.\\nI LOVE it \\nI should have bought one a long time ago.\\nNot enough time for me to give it 5 stars \\nI ve had the MacBook Pro 15 for about three weeks  and it really is a great computer.\\nI have only had PCs with Windows before so this takes a little getting use to.\\nThe real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it s speed.\\nIt is fast booting up   shutting down  and connection with the internet.\\nThe one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel.\\nI think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive  but I rather have a hard copy.\\nIf what you need is a machine to do some surfing  email checking  word processing  and watching a movie or two  this is the machine you want.\\nIt s priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box.\\nNice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours  or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents.\\nthe screen/video resolution won t increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60\\nThat being said  it still runs video in full screen decently.\\nThe sound is a bit quiet if you re on a plane  this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones.\\nBottom line  I doubt you d be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine.\\nYes  I thought the expese was a little much  but I now realize you get what you pay for.\\nI love my Apple  it is quick and easy to use.\\nI ve had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful  english speaking  from Vancouver  techs that walked me through the processes to help me.\\nI can t say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket.\\nMoney and time well spent \\nHighly recommended \\nThe 13  Macbook Pro just fits in my

great.\\nSpeakers doesn t sound that great.\\nLove the speed  especially \\nSo glad I decided to upgrade \\nI ve owned this labtop for less then two months  already the mouse button has broke.\\nStill under warrenty so called Toshiba  no help at all.\\nI m stuck w/ a broken computer.\\nWill not buy another Toshiba  this is my second  not happy w/ either.\\nI love its solid build  light wt and excellent battery life  for now .\\nExcellent LED monitor and well equipped.\\nI love the Apple products.\\nThe Toshiba Mini Notebook  Model NB 305N410BL  is a great little computer.\\nIt is easy to use  its keyboard easily accommodates large hands  and its weight is fantasic.\\nUpgrading from Windows 7 Starter  thru Windows 7 Home Premium  to Windows 7 Professional was a snap;\\nboth upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary Product Key.\\nOther installed features  such as certain printer software  are also most attractive.\\nEver since I bought this laptop  so far I ve experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines.\\nI constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.\\nToshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another  and I am not kidding you  I called different hours of the day and you ll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again  since they make it sound like they don t have your history list of your calls right in front of them.\\nIt s a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.\\nAnd at one point  they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop  I bought the memory stick they recomended .\\nLong story short  since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one  I didn t ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop  but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year  they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services  they finally gave in.\\nWas this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba \\nI ll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba.\\nRemember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product.\\nAll I can say is WOW.\\nThis laptop is insane \\nIt s so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with.\\nI bought a protector for my key pad and it works great  \\nThis is definitely a computer worth the money;\\nThe mouse is a little bit different than what you re used to though it has one big flat panel and one full bar  instead of two separate ones  to click with but you get used to it quite quickly.\\nAND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer  when they have a certain promotion/offer going  of course \\nOverall  this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.\\nThe Apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you  \\nObviously  this Macbook is PERFECT for me because it does exactly what I need in an easytofunction way.\\nDEFINITELY recommended \\nNot a bad laptop  it s a bit slow  but gets the job done.\\nThe lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months.\\nI could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat.\\nupon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told  was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.\\neven though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.\\nDealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture.\\nEnglish must have been his third or fourth language.\\nHis language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test  and it was failing.\\nafter trying to get some help he disconnected on me.\\nAfter 4 days  being denied 6 times and told off once  I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt.\\nThen they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me.\\nAfter they found no other way  they told me to courier it to them since they don t allow the use of the post office  at my expense  and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn t be covered.\\nI managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me.\\nThey really do have the worlds very worst repair service.\\nThis computer gets very hot  before shutting down.\\nIt is not ideal for children because of the temp.\\nI Contacted HP\\xa0\\xa0about this situation and was given excuses  without results.\\nThey didn t even try to assist me or even offer a replacement.\\nI will never purchase a HP again ever.\\nLet s just get this out of the way  I love Apple \\nBut the Macbook is the best \\nIt is super easy to use.\\nAll you have to do is turn it on and it works.\\nIt is very durable  I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet.\\nI don t do any high tech stuff on it  just write papers  check mail  and sometimes play games  so I can t reccomend it if you are in the computer field.\\nIn the past four years I ve had it I have never once gotten a virus.\\nI did have to replace the battery once  but that was only a couple months ago and it s been working perfect ever since.\\nI would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use  stylish  fun  awesome computer.\\nAlso it is very good for college students who just need a reliable  easy to use computer.\\nThis laptop does everything I need it to very well.\\nThe best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features.\\nThe screen is bright and the keyboard is nice;\\nI find myself using the 10key more than I thought I would.\\nBattery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos.\\nFor those that care about noise this thing doesn t really make any;\\nthe i3 processor doesn t seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on.\\nI took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.\\nI wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff.\\nOnce I removed all the software the laptop loads in 1520 seconds.\\nThis is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine;\\nmy niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn t require a dedicated video card.\\nOverall I am very satisfied with the purchase.\\nGreat  quick laptop for the money.\\nRight size and weight for portability.\\nBattery life needs more life.\\nBattery is not upgradable to a longer life battery.\\nI love everything about it.\\nThe only downfall is the battery only last 1.52.0 hrs when not plugged in.\\nI would like at least a 4 hr. battery life.\\nOtherwise  all other features are a 1\\nThis mac is great \\nlightweight  long battery life  excellent transition from PC;\\nTHIS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE SINCE WE PURCHASED IT.\\nI will NEVER buy  Refurbished  again  I don t cae how cheap it is.\\nJust don t waste your time and money on this.\\nI tried giving it 0 stars but I had to choose at least one  but IMO NO STARS\\nSummary  Dont buy HP.\\nIf you buy  pray you dont have major prolems.\\nRuns Hot\\nI thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an Apple product.\\nAfter a little more than a year of owning my MacBook Pro  the monitor has completely died.\\nThis purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks  and I am impressed with the intuition of the design  the beauty of the product  and the excellent technological advances associated with it.\\nThen 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro.\\nNow they are believers in the product.\\nIt is easy to use  has great screen quality  and every so light weight.\\nThis little netboook is helping me get work done \\nI homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat.\\nI am first time Mac Buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the Mac offers.\\nI bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her  it s very lightweight  and the response for the computing she s doing  Internet focused activity  mail  research  etc.  is excellent;\\nThe overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she d recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook.\\nIf you re looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphicsintensive game  you d be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market.\\nprevious laptops were pc s  still have them  but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system.\\nstill testing the battery life as i thought it would be better  but am very happy with the upgrade.\\nProbably as good as you can get in a netbook  does everything I ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses.\\nHas met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device.\\nSo far  so good \\nI ve been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory.\\nI don t understand why only Windows 7 Starter is included.\\nStrong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed\\nThis device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers.\\nEnjoy that Toshib force and durability unparalleled\\nNeeds longer lasting battery  More than 1 to 2 Hrs.\\nNeeds Power and Mouse Cable to Plug in back instead of side  In the way of operating a mouse in small area.\\nFor the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop.\\nComfterbale to use light easy to transport.\\nI love this product because it is Toshiba and its 15.6 .\\nIt has no camera but  I can always buy and install one easy.\\nI had a USB connect but  i can t use it because it is not compatible.\\nThat s the downside for me.\\nBut  I would recommend this product.\\nSatisfy what I paid for it.\\nGood monitor and performed well.\\nI am using the external speaker sound is good.\\nBest thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs.\\nI recommend for word processing and internet users.\\nThe games included are very good games.\\nI would highly recommend this one to my friends\\nI bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio.\\nIt works great for general internet use  Microsoft Office apps  home bookkeeping  etc.\\nIt doesn t have a lot of frills  but I didn t need any  and being

works with World Of Warcraft wonderfully.\\nAll in all great item highly recommend it.\\ni would have to say that overall its great \\nAside from the trial software and the short battery life  lack of a webcam  its great.\\nFast  great visual \\nOh yea  has no numeric pad on the side.\\n2nd Best computer in the world  only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches  to make less easier for people to hack into\\nMy favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen.\\nGreat wifi too.\\nThe screen is a little glary  and I hated the clicking buttons  but I got used to them.\\nOverall for the money this is a good deal.\\nThere is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer.\\nThe speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better.\\nwhile the keyboard itself is alright  the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons.\\nI am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite  I like the extra features  I love the windows 7

to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front.\\nI also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen.\\nI went to Toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it.\\nOne of them seems to have worked.\\nIts a good laptop for its value.\\nRegistration/1st use is easy.\\nFeatures like the font are very blocklike and old

performance for the price of the computer.\\nGraphics are clean and sharp  internet interfaces are seamless.\\nOnly issue is that it is a little slow  and I m fixing that by adding more RAM.\\nSound

3 months after purchasing it.\\nIt does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it.\\nThe system it comes with does not work properly  so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all.\\nWhen calling Dell for help  reurn  or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it.\\nOne year of trying to fix the computer by myself  with help of friends  and even help from computer experts I have given up on trying to fix it.\\nThis computer was awful  I would never recomend it to another person.\\nThose moments in thime

ABOUT TOSHIBA LAPTOPS.\\nWILL NOT EVERY BUY ANOTHERLOU\\nThis is a great value for the money.\\nThis is a great computer.\\nWe haven t had any problems with it at all.\\nThe body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up.\\nOverall though  for the money spent it s a great deal.\\nBut let me tell you  the mac book pro is so professional.\\nIts very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer.\\nFor example  when my husband turns the light out while I m on the computer. the screen brightness automatically adjusts.\\nIt is VERY easy to type on and feels great  besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted.\\nOh  it is such a great piece of equipment.\\nIts Office compatible  but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs.\\nI get a ton of compliments on its size  and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus  I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you re restricted to the width of your body for computing room.\\nVery longlife battery  up to 1011 hours depending on how you configure power level settings .\\nI upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home  and it runs just fine.\\nI play a lot of casual games online  and the touchpad is very responsive.\\nI wouldn t play a firstperson shooter with this  mind  but if you wanted to run MS Office  email  chat  download a video  listen to music from a certain fruitnamed music store  and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in  I d highly recommend checking this out.\\nThe downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook  screen size is not something I d stare at for the entire 1011 hours of battery life five days a week.\\nAdditional caveat  the base installation comes with some Toshibaspecific software that may or may not be to a user s liking.\\nEverything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point.\\nLOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT \\nIt really is perfect for work and play.\\nI am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it.\\nEverything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome.\\nThe only thing that isn t perfect about this netbook is the speakers  they are not loud at all but I expected that.\\nI upgraded it s RAM to 2GB  I am very happy with it.\\nlots of preloaded software.\\nthe only problem is that i had to add 1 gb RAM  the computer was kinda slow.\\ntosiba has a good reputation  my llast computer was an acer.\\nthis is starting off good.\\nWhat a great little laptop.\\nMaybe not the cutting edge  Satellite L455D  but it is a workhorse.\\nI bought it to use in college and it is perfect.\\nI dual boot with Linux and that other securityprone OS and it performs flawlessly.\\nI made a perfect decision when I bought the Toshiba \\nExcellent product for the money.\\nNo problems  no lock ups  no disappointments.\\nNot super fancy  but not super expensive either.\\nHighly recommend for daily use.\\nThe Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks.\\nI have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed.\\nToshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done.\\nI would tell the technician I knew\\xa0exactly\\xa0what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in.\\nThis computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions.\\nAs well as having the plug in the computer come loose.\\nSo having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.\\nIt still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there.\\nThe Mac Book Pro performs flawlessly.\\nNever had a single problem  and don t have to worry about viruses.\\nWhile I mostly use it for email  internet and gaming  I m confident all other applications live up to the high standard I ve come to appreciate from Mac laptops.\\nWorth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment.\\nRight out of the box  this little netbook did everything I asked of it  including streaming the everyday video you re bound to encounter checking mail and websites  my biggest complaint previously .\\nIt even has a great webcam  and Skype works very well.\\nThe fact that you can spend over $100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine.\\nThe Windows 7 Starter is  in my opinion  a great way to think about using your netbook  basics  basics  basics.\\nI wiped nearly everything off of it  installed OpenOffice and Firefox  and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price.\\nThis netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop  my wife and I have another laptop  or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks.\\nI use this for my tutoring business  and since I m always bouncing from student to student  it is ideal for portability and battery life  yes  it gets the 8 hours as advertised .\\nASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks  and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them.\\nlittle short on RAM but you get what you pay for.\\nthe hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer  left right and front.\\nthe headphone and mic jack are in front of touchpad making the touchpad hard to use when using headphones/mic  not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person.\\nCords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction.\\nI love windows 7 but i can t give Toshiba any credit for that  unless y all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time.\\nI was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305DS5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty.\\nThe computer was shipped to their repair depot\\xa0 on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned.\\nThey were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place.\\nThe computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.\\nThe computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue.\\nInstead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air  to Louisville Ky.\\nAnd Toshiba is totally unconcerned.\\nThe reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter.\\nWe don t Mind and You don t Matter.\\nI would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter.\\nWhen it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you don t matter.\\nWindows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service.\\nI ve tried going back to XL but there still problems.\\nThe technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother.\\nJust a bunch of idiots who s English as a 5th language is forced at best.\\nI m all for saving money but Dell needs to step it up.\\nGood price.\\nBasic computer.\\nDidn t work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop  same make/model .\\nIt has worked fine.\\nHandles all my basic media needs easily.\\nCan listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display.\\nIt is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not.\\nIt s a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs.\\nIt has served my needs quite nicely for the most part.\\nThe 2 GB of RAM is plenty  able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown.\\nMy one complaint with this laptop is that I ve noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.\\nThis is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components  and I m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator  but I still expected better product quality for this price range.\\nOther than that  I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semidecent gaming capabilities.\\nLet me start with the good So awesome.\\nGreat OS  fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port.\\nThis one has had the same effect.\\nThe improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual  but substantive.\\nThe Unibody construction is solid  sleek and beautiful.\\nIt is everything I d hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint  but somehow a bit more sturdy.\\nFor the not so good  I got the stock screen  which is VERY glossy.\\nIt s still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.\\nThe reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlledlighting environment like me  I prefer it dark  or if you can crank up the brightness.\\nThe statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration  it s a lie.\\nI challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.\\nThe first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.\\nEnabling the battery timer is useless.\\nThe  Time remaining  goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.\\nIt s so bad that I m thinking I only got half a battery or something.\\nI know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.\\nMy only other complaint is that it gets really hot.  \\nIf you buy this  don t go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life  and you ll be perfectly satisfied.\\nThe pro is a great product  I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge  the edges hurt my wrists .\\nOther than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more.\\nGreat product by Apple with the new great looking design.\\nI actually had the hard drive replaced twice  the mother board once  the dvd drive twice  then they FINALLY agreed to replace it   ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS only to get another  HP/Compaq  piece of crap.\\nIt was slow  locked up  and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months \\nSo  buyers beware \\nIt is made better  thicker  and all out tough \\nI droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and IT is still working with NO issues \\nI love the easy to see screen  and It works well for work  persoal or just play.\\nI tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba.\\nMy friends or children use that when they need to borrow the Net =  When I out grow this Meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one ANd I will be buying only TOSHIBA \\nI just love this lap top  I just wish it were all silver or they had all black.\\nThat is my only complaint \\nLOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET \\nWOULD PAY MORE FOR IT IF I HAD TOO \\nI recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it \\nIt meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling.\\nI am totally satisfied with my little toshie \\nFrom the moment I opened the box to the present it has been a great joy.\\nIt is always reliable  never bugged and responds well.\\nI love the operating system and the preloaded software.\\nThis machine delivers.\\nIt is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine.\\nIt is a bit heavy.\\nIt would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required.\\nHad some trouble finding a case that it would fit in.\\nThis is an oversized  18inch laptop.\\nIt wouldn t fit in most 17inch bags.\\nI was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard doesn t light up on this model.\\nIt also does not have bluetooth.\\nYou ll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them.\\nI was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing  I took it for granted that these features were standard.\\nOverall  still a very nice machine.\\nBoots up fast and runs great \\nI m pleased.\\nThe acer one compuer is a great computer.\\nI didn t want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice.\\nIts fast  has High definition quality in the videos.\\nThe pictures are clear as can be.\\nIf I had to buy another computer  I would most definetly buy an acer one computer.\\nHeck  if I had enough   money  I would but it as a gift for someone.\\nIm glad that it has such great features in it.\\nIt also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home.\\nClear picture on it and everything.\\nThe one down side to it is that when I play a certin game on here  it tends to freeze up sometimes  but thats the only bad thing about this computer.\\nThe acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it  but I like the big screen on it.\\nIts good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies.\\nIm very happy with this computer \\nIt s solid.\\nLove the stability of the Mac software and operating system.\\nThe only downfall is a lot of the software I have won t work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it.\\nIt seems to be incompatible with everything else.\\nBut the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X.\\ni love to use it it is esay and light.\\nthis laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with.\\ni needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria.\\nthis laptop is great for work and doing my pictures.\\ni am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well  but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing.\\nthe programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm.\\ni can use it for all of my needs.\\ni give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me.\\nif this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again.\\ni think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go.\\nFrom the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer \\nThe OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.\\nThe track pad to me is what really stands out though  you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad  awesome thinking Apple \\nThe OS is also very user friendly  even for those that switch from a PC  with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS \\nApple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience \\nFrom the start  when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine.\\nThe ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it.\\nThe screen is bright and clear  the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice.\\nFast  fast and fast  the web pages just fly by.\\nI had my IWORKS  Itunes  Email  MS Office  network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour.\\nThat includes transferring my music and movies.\\nGood bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors \\nSkype is just so dang cool with this machine too.\\nIf your time is worth anything to you  if you are tired of rebooting  reformatting  reinstalling  trying to find drivers  if you want a computer to work for you for a change  make the change to this computer.\\nIt is light and the battery last a very long time.\\nVery fast boot up and shut down.\\nLet me tell you  this machine is great.\\nPurchased for development purposes  but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing  email  etc.\\nI thought learning the Mac OS would be hard  but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC.\\nThe most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times  and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing.\\nThe only time I have restarted is during system updates.\\ngreat machine if you want to drop the cash for one.\\nOk  this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple.\\nThe case is carved out of a single block of aluminum.\\nThe processor screams  and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions  most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software.\\nI have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one.\\nI like it so much  I bought another just for my wife.\\nTook it back as it was defective.\\nPage just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something.\\nCouldn t keep a page up you were working on \\nwas a great deal i will give that.\\nthe laptop preformed pretty well.\\nit cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once.\\nit has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again.\\nthe mouse on the pad  the left button always sticks.\\nthe mouse is way way way to sensitve.\\ni tried turning it done but it did nothing.\\nthe mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too.\\nits not bad just VERY VERY annoying.\\nthink i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop.\\nI am very happy with this laptop.\\nFor the price and what I get out of it has exceeded my expectations.\\nI always have used a tower home PC and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance.\\nAmazing Quality \\nPlus stylish.\\nThe big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies   pictures and etc \\nThe flaws are  this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X.\\nMac is not made for gaming.\\nBUT there s this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows.\\nSecond  it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated\\nWas not happy with one of the programs on it.\\nIt was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer  was a six month trial.\\nAlso  the extended warranty was a problem.\\nThe extended warranty for the $4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu.\\nOverall the computer is very easy to use  the screen is perfect  great computer  my daughter loves.\\nI finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.\\nI did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements  but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased.\\nSo I m disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority.\\nI just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I won t have to worry about a crash.\\nI bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly\\xa0dissatisfied with it.\\nThe Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning.\\nIt freezes  and it always shows that there is an error  so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it.\\nI tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem.\\nWell  I started using Google Chrome  which is a little better  but it freezes too sometimes.\\nThis Notebook restarts every time there is a new update  so if you don t save your files and information  everything will be lost.\\nAnother issue I have with it is the battery.\\nMaybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden.\\nThere is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle  and when I click on it it says    Consider replacing your battery  and it does not hold full charge.\\nIt is not even a year old yet  so I would\\xa0definitely not recommend it to anyone.\\nDon t waste your money \\nThe laptop is gorgeous.\\nIt is sleek  smooth  and lightweight.\\nIt is easily portable and I take it everywhere I go and might require internet access.\\nThe screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution.\\nThe processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications.\\nIt is quiet and a real joy to watch work.\\nI love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky \\nOverall this laptop is great.\\nIt has plenty of memory  lots of hard drive  and great graphics.\\nIt runs very quiet too which is a plus.\\nThe only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible.\\nThey only stay charged a little over an hour.\\nLaptops are usually used on the go  so why not give you a better battery \\nThe processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing.\\nThe notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a Svideo port that would enable one to hook it to a TV.\\nIt is a cheap throw together.\\nSave your money and go for a better device.\\nThis laptop is a great price and has a sleek look.\\nRuns smooth and quick.\\nI wish it had a webcam though  then it would be perfect \\nI Love my new computer \\nIts fast and another thing I like is that it has three USB ports.\\nI love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both \\nThank you for your great product \\nEverything about this computer is easy to use.\\nwonderful features.\\nThe only thing is that the battery won t last more than 1/2 an hour.\\nIt discharges too quickly.\\nKind of annoying  but I still love the laptop.\\nIt has good speed and plenty of hard drive space.\\nThe only downfall is the volume control.\\nThe wheel that turns the volume up and down doesn t work in real time.\\nI have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute.\\nI bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since.\\nI love it so much.\\nIt has come into good use for my finances  scheduling  my parents business expenses  and it is definitely amazing for gaming.\\nThe best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once  it never slows down.\\nIt s just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open.\\nIt works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box.\\nGREAT INVESTMENT \\nThe price and features more than met my needs.\\nThe feature are good enough for what I need.\\nI love my macbook pro \\nMy laptop is almost 2yrs old and I have never had any problems with it.\\nIf you are a PC user looking to convert I would HIGHLY recommend it \\nIt may take a little getting used to but you don t have to worry about viruses or other headaches.\\nNot to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs.\\nI am ADDICTED to photo booth \\nIt is SO much fun to play with.\\nI work with kids and they love making short videos on there.\\nI am able to organize my pics  music and files easily.\\nIf you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac \\nI love the keyboard.\\nThe display is awesome.\\nOnly thing I would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive.\\nBut other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers.\\nI think this computer is super lame.\\nI dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing.\\nI decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it.\\nIt doesnt work worth a damn.\\nThe display is beyond horrible.\\nI can not even read what I am writing half of the time.\\nThere are so many things wrong with this product  it just makes me want to set my self on fire \\nI would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage.\\nNot to mention it has shit gigs.\\nI could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage.\\nDo yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop.\\nI bought this last week  and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touchmouse stopped responding.\\ngot another 1  and same issue.\\nI am taking back today.\\nDon t waste your money or time.\\nVery dissappointed becase I have had toshibas for years  and never a issue.\\nSTOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my oneyear warranty was up.\\nToshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it.\\nApparently there is a manufacturing defect  something with the amount of thermal paste.\\nTOSHIBA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM.\\nWhen I called Toshiba  they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $35 for the phone call  even though they didn t offer any technical support.\\nI loved the netbook  minus the fact that it was windows OS  until this started happening.\\nBut if you can t make your product last more than a year  you will not get my business again.\\nI ve had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it \\nIn those three years  I ve had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily.\\nMy power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership  so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan.\\nIn the three years I ve had my MacBook Pro  I have never had a virus on my computer  and I do a lot of work on the internet.\\nThe iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product.\\nI highly recommend this product \\nNeeds constant repair.\\nFirst the screen goes completely out.\\nThen HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up  not able to connect.\\nNow the screen is going darker  darker  darker.\\nHP is more interested in selling extended warranties  which cost more than the netbook new  then they are in helping or fixing.\\nOh yeah  don t forget the expensive shipping to and from HP.\\nI v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook  of course a different brand.\\nSo far so good with this laptop.\\nFan vents to the side  so no cooling pad needed  great feature \\nScreen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive.\\nMemory is upgradable.\\nThe only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys.\\nThey click.\\nsounds like a typewriter  but if you can get past that  this is a great laptop for a little money \\nI HATE this one.\\nVista is a nightmare.\\nNo tutorials on the display.\\nThe book is useless.\\nThe machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your HDTV.\\nThinking about returning it\\nThe Macbook is a fantastic laptop.\\nYou will love this macbook if you choose to buy it.\\nThe macbook rarely requires a hard reboot.\\nIt just works flawlessly \\nIts hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action.\\nI honestly love my mac  thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict.\\nThis was purchased for my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised.\\nIt had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one.\\nIt made the computer much easier to use and navigate.\\nKeyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.\\nThis system came loaded with Windows 7 Starter.\\nSo far  so good.\\nWhen I got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school  I had a hard time from beginning.\\nI feel that it was poorly put together  because once in a while different plastic\\xa0pieces\\xa0would come off of it.\\nQuite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned.\\nFor me  five stars is not enough.\\nI love the 15  MacBook Pro.\\nMy parents bought it for me as a graduation gift  and i m totally  almost kind of maybe definitely  obsessed with it.\\nIt was very easy to just pick up and use\\nIt did not take long to get used to the Mac OS.\\nI love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for  Internet  artwork  and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable.\\nThere are several programs for school or office use  Pages  Numbers  Keynote  etc.  music  Garageband  photo management  Photo Booth  iPhoto  videoediting or moviemaking  iMovie  etc.\\nThe builtin webcam is great for Skype and similar videochat services.\\niTunes is a handy musicmanagement program  and it is essential for anyone with an iPod.\\nAllinall  I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone.\\nI love it \\nThey definitely have a superior product \\nIts not just slow on the internet  its slow in general.\\nNo I am generous calling it slow.\\nits more like a snail crawl.\\nhe can t stand it.\\nI can t begin to say how disappointed I am.\\nI should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer.\\nthe key bindings take a little getting used to  but have loved the Macbook Pro.\\nDelivery was early too.\\nIt allows me to do everything I need from a computer and more.\\nWith awesome graphics and assuring security  it s perfect \\nI d recommend this laptop to anyone \\nThe Toshiba Satellite laptop is  DESIGNED  to fail  \\nThe board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.\\nToshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it.\\nI actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.\\nThen after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I d have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.\\nIt has far exceeded my expectations for power  storage  and abilitiy.\\nIt is easy to navigate and update programs.\\nI ve never had problems with viruses.\\nMy next laptop will also be a Mac \\nI would like to tell you about the best laptop I just got from Mac.\\nMy mac laptop is fabulous in both areas.\\nIt gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit.\\nThe Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy  and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer  which is also a mac.\\nI would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could.\\nIn my line of work  I often have to take work home  and this makes it so easy.\\nI do transcription work on the side  and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well.\\nThe apple care has never failed me  and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well.\\nI will only buy apple laptops from now on.\\nGreat laptop for school  easy to use for beginners in the household.\\nKeyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable.\\nBattery life could be better but overall for the price and Toshiba s reputation for laptops it s great \\nMy MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment.\\nFrom the build quality to the performance  everything about it has been subpar from what I would have expected from Apple.\\nThe system constantly overheats  the battery life is too short  the case is coming apart  and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly.\\nI would not recommend this product to anyone.\\nScreen is awesome  battery life is good.\\nReally like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints.\\nGood laptop for the money.\\nSpeakers don t get that loud  but good enough.\\nThey don t crash.\\nIf a website ever freezes  which is rare  its really easy to force quit.\\nNever been hacked.\\nNo viruses.\\nI have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free  even without the warranty.\\nA mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense.\\nIts also FUN to use \\nThe programs are great  like iphoto  love the editing capabilities  imail  which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad  imovie  etc.\\nShe said its very user friendly.\\nHowever  I love this particular Mac because its very fast  great size  and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad.\\nI am very happy I bought this Mac  well worth the extra money.\\nNow that I have it I see that I really needed this for much more.\\nI run Dreamweaver  Final Cut Pro 7  Photoshop  Safari  Firefox  MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time.\\nI have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.\\nI highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door.\\nThat was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought.\\nMy MacBook Pro is no exception.\\nSince I ve had this computer I ve only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.\\nI also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.\\nThe computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it  iPhoto  iMovie  iWeb  iTunes  GarageBand  is all very helpful as well.\\nI would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality \\nShiny\\nThis Laptop is the Best of the best \\nThe Awesomest of the awesomest.\\nIt is so great  I can Hardly ever take my hands off it \\nMy friends are in awe every time they come over \\nI got it for Christmas  and I was so excited to set it up \\nIt is super fast  and always loads.\\nI am just amazed.\\nThe only bad part is the size/weight.\\nIt s like 9 punds  but if you can look past it  it s GREAT \\nIf you don t like fingerprints  this might not be the laptop for you.\\nIt super shiny  so you can see the fingerprints easily.\\nAll for such a great price.\\nIt s color is even cool.\\nAnother Great thing is the Beast graphics.\\nThey are so realistic I am just speechless.\\nI let my friend borrow it  and she knows nothing about computers  and she used it with ease.\\nThe cool thing about this is anyone can use it.\\nI don t know how I could ever live without my Qousmio.\\nI own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I ve had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb  201\\nIve had to call tech support many times.\\nEach time taking about 1 day or so.\\nI had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly.\\nI had to pay for the shipping \\nI will never buy anything from HP again \\nThe Toshiba Satellite has been more than I expected for the price.\\nTHis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse.\\nYou can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever.\\nfor being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is.\\nwhen i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke.\\nbut after i got used to it i love it.\\nthe size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming.\\nit has 3 usb ports  1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion.\\nthe only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have.\\noverall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive.\\ni use my mac all the time  i love the software  the way it takes a short time to load things  how easy it is to use and most of all how you don t have to worry about viruses.\\nWith a mac you don t have to worry about antivirus software or firewall  it s so wonderful.\\nAll apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything  no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.\\nthis computer will last you at least 7 years  thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.\\neverything about a mac is wonderful  it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system  but you will learn fast and its all worth it.\\nNot working = bad\\nI spent 2200 dollars on a  top of the line laptop .\\nI got the blue screen of death the first month I got it.\\n1  Payed $2200 for a  premium  laptop\\n2  Blue screen first month\\n3  Horrible customer supportthey lost my laptop for a monthgot it back 3 months later\\n4  Laptop still did not work  blue screen within a week...\\n5  Cut my losses and sold it for parts\\nthis company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this  never  happen...\\nwhat an elegant  wonderful machine.\\nI m making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the  old  way  and Apple does  indeed  have the better idea.\\nI really wish I had done this years ago.\\nPairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure  talk about painless syncing  used to take me forever  now it s a snap.\\nI love it  never had a computer I was so impressed with  and I ve had a lot of laptops and desktops  this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE.\\nI tell everyone that I know  friends  family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used.\\nThe computer blinks it shuts off at will.\\nThe letter A stopped working after the first week.\\nwhen i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.\\nso the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault.\\nthey have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem.\\nthey have not sent a new one nor called.\\ni spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus.\\nthen on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east.\\nSo when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand.\\nThen to make matters worst  there is noone that they can transfer you to.\\nI had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair.\\nGot the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it.\\n3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications.\\nDO NOT BUY GATEWAY COMPUTERS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS HORRIBLE.\\nYOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY.\\nCOMPUTER HAS BEEN AT SERVICE FACILITY MORE THAN IN MY HANDS.\\nI have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied.\\nThe only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones.\\nAnother thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it.\\nThat whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.\\nIt took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.\\nANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke.\\nTo be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.\\nThe graphics are great.\\nThe internet speed is spectacular.\\nThe battery life is probably an hour at best.\\nOh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.\\nI would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.\\nI wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month.\\nI received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst.\\nAt first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again.\\nThis computer doesn t do that well with certain games it can t play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.\\nOh and if thats not bad enough it doesn t come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.\\nthe whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop.\\nI bought a HP Pavilion DV41222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer.\\nThe computer is so slow  even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up.\\nThey said it was a computer error on this type of computer.\\nAlso  I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot  and not even sitting on anything to make it hot.\\nWhen the computer has been on for several minutes  it will occasionaly just go off by itself.\\nAlso  the battery does not last very long at all.\\nI would recommend not buying this product.\\nI have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem.\\nI am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with.\\nAlso  I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly.\\nAlso  I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines.\\nIt gets stuck all of the time you use it  and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work.\\nSometimes the screen even goes black on this computer.\\nWill probably never buy a HP again.\\nPurchased a Toshiba Lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out.\\nAfter the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace.\\nI hate it.\\nI have had the luxury  sarcasm  of owning 2 of these laptops.\\nThe first fell apart right after the 1yearwarranty.\\nDuring that time  I had to send it back 3 times.\\nI paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me.\\nNone of the techs at HP knew what they were doing.\\nThey would repair one thing  send it back and it would still have the same problem.\\nThe processor went on me  the fan went and the motherboard went.\\nI wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused  because they knew it was trouble.\\nI had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.\\nI took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty.\\nI sent it back AND THEY LOST IT.\\nI waited and waited and no laptop.\\nFinally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.\\nI waited another month for approval and for them to  BUILD  me a new laptop.\\nHere we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.\\nHP didn t fix it.\\nI swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one.\\nin 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.\\n1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in.\\nreturned it.\\n5 months dead again.\\nThey say sorry out of warranty.\\nSummary  They played games with me for the warranty period.\\nNow 17 months later they want  would not say exact amount  $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine.\\nThey had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything.\\nNow the machine won t connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I m out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.\\nSo buyer beware when buying Toshiba\\nThey are wonderful  but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat.\\nI burned my leg  after lifting it from my desk  and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table  so I can place it there.\\nI had to call Apple 19 times  each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone  and take it to their store for evaluations  and diagnostics  5 times.\\nFor my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin  it happened 7 months ago  they offered me an ITouch 8Gig  you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich  offer a loyal customer like me  a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this .\\nSteve Jobs  probably needs help and donations  and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby.\\nThe lesson learned here is  It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand  since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible  as fast as they can  and in this day and age  the customer no longer is right all the times.\\nI am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook  it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.\\nAnyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.\\nSo I called customer support  which is good too  and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all  I just chose to hide the message.\\nAlso the speakers are not very loud  But it is a netbook.\\nWould HIGHLY recommend this netbook though.\\nI custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the techie due to his accent.\\nThe computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork.\\nMy laptop cost approximately $2 300 and DIED after only 2years  10months and 18days of use.\\nAlthough my model was listed as recalled  HP denied my claim.\\nThis laptop leaves alot to be desired  I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice...\\nI bought it from HSN because it was  bundled  with extra software  but as it turns out  that software just crashes it more often.....\\nIf you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal.\\nThe repairs were made quickly though I must say  however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me.\\nUnable to boot up this brand new laptop.\\nSpent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support.\\nThey went through asking me open up various components  taking battery out  hard disk apart  and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it.\\nThey are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site.\\nI am going to go back and return at Store I bought from \\nThis computer had exactly the specifications I needed.\\nSmall enough to use on a long flight  Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips.\\nThe perfect notebook...\\nWhen I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed.\\nThe Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid  I have tried both Motorola and HTC  plugged into the USB port.\\nCalled tech support and got the usual Acer  We don t support software but for $$$ we can help you  I explained there was no software involved in booting.\\nNo  tey don t even support their own bios and it  could be a problem with the bios  How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity \\nNeedless to say a PC that can t support a cell phone is less than useless \\nWith today s company fighting over marketshare  its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone.\\nI agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.\\nSummary  I ve had this laptop for 2 months  out of the blue the power adapter stops working.\\nBut no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE \\nFrustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 23 days for turnaround time.\\nThis was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.\\nThe rep did not even answer my question  I had to ask him  if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn t even try to acknowledge my question.\\nI m tired of the inept service.\\nIf you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS \\nUnless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can t find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.\\nI M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE.\\nHOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK \\nOur Apple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer  Z0J80001  Notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking.\\nI do everything on this computer  check email  facebook  shop  check blogs  write papers  listen to music  and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv.\\nIt pretty much does everything we could ever need  and looks great to boot.\\nApple is always great about the aesthetics of things  they always come up with good looking products.\\nIt didn t take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation  it s been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better.\\nSo  if you re thinking of a laptop  I would heartily recommend theApple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer  Z0J80001  Notebook for all your needs \\nIt s great and we will always stick with Apple computers  we have been so happy with them.\\nThe 13  MacBook Pro is portable  durable  and very capable.\\nIt has a 10 hour battery life when you re doing web browsing and word editing  making it perfect for the classroom or office  and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ll have a battery life of just over 5 hours.\\nIt s also very energy efficient  running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb.\\nIt s graphics aren t bad at all  for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum  easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics.\\nThe operating system and user interface is very intuitive  and the large multitouch track pad is amazing.\\nHowever  the multitouch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary  unless you re gaming .\\nStill  this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work.\\nThey also have a longer service life than other computers  I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks .\\nProbbly the worst decision we ever made \\nIt has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard \\npretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were.\\ni love the size of the computer since i play games on it.\\ni also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.\\nalso the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.\\nSo i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer\\nFirst  it does not have a push button to open the lid.\\nIt is held in place magnetically.\\nThere is a little indent to help open it  but good luck with that.\\nOnce open  the leading edge is razor sharp.\\nThis is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design.\\nUsing this machine is like a mild form of torture.\\nThe much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare.\\nI lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening.\\nAlso  the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it.\\nI hate to say this  but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back  then I would.\\nIt is absolutely horrible to use  despite all its so called advanced features.\\nI regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use.\\nIt s a bummer and one out of five is being kind.\\nMy Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary.\\nIn due course  I ll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs  in the trash.\\nBut the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing.\\nI like this machine because its very lightweight...\\nvery convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent...\\n10 hours of battery life is really something else....\\nI highly recommend that you buy this product.\\nIt crashes  and when it goes flat  it just DIES  like a PC  maybe worse  and I loose all my open documents \\nI Hate it \\nIt is the easiest computer I have ever used\\nI LOVE IT \\nI can t say enough good for it \\nIt s A MAC \\nI fine Apple MC373LL/A 2.66GHz 15  Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go.\\nI like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races.\\nIt s face and depanable.\\nAs a graphic arts a retired instructor I still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .....\\nit s just a great toy to have around.\\nvery very slow laptop.\\ntons of bloatware and junk programs.\\ncan t reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers.\\nkeys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed.\\nlots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small.\\nAmazing machine.\\nIt is a big big  but since it has a 18.4  screen what would you expect \\nIt is truly a Desktop Replacement.\\nVery fast and efficient \\nDoes a great job with video shot on a Canon 5D MKII.\\nVery happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop \\nThe touchpad is very intuitive  so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again \\nOf course  I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork  GarageBand  and iMovie.\\nI especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems \\nThe only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets  and rather quickly too.\\nI also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program.\\nNow I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac \\nI also got the added bonus of a 30  HD Monitor  which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh \\nI never have had a good result with this computer.\\nI was told by many  that it was a great computer  but we got one of these  and it worked  great for one year  and as soon as the warrenty was up  then it got  really bad.\\nThey told me it was my loss even though it was the computer  not  what I ve done.\\nThe hard drive crashed as well  and I had to buy a new  power cord.\\nThey told me to reprogram the computer  and I didn t need  to do that  and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her  life.\\nI don t like this company nor the toshiba brand  and I ll never  buy another one because I ve put more into it then it is worth.\\nI would  rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that  isn t good at all.\\nThe right speaker did not work.\\nAgain  the same problem  the right speaker did not work.\\nI returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund.\\nthe mouse pad and buttons are the worst i ve ever seen.\\nsometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move.\\nthe mouse buttons are hard to push.\\ni cant believe HP put this out.\\ndo not buy you will be disappointed.\\ni m returning mine\\ndell is a decently made pc.\\nthe graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.\\nwith the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch.\\nso in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.\\nI love HP  it s the only computer/printer we will buy.\\nThis is perfect for her field.\\nAt first when I got this product  I loved it.\\nThe computer itself was fast  ran smoothly  and had no problems.\\nThen  within 5 months  the charger crapped out on me.\\nSo I called Compaq  and after being on the phone for 3 hours  i finally got a replacement which I shouldn t have had a problem getting since it was under warranty.\\n2 months later  the battery went.\\nThey gave me a hard time yet again  but their was a malfunction in the battery itself  it didn t die.\\nTHEN  one month after the warranty expired  the replacement charger went.\\nI had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.\\nNot worth it one bit.\\nThe people are frustrating to work with  the product itself is very cheaply made  and the accessories are less than satisfactory.\\nAlso  my sister got the exact same laptop  since they were so cheap  and after 8 months  the screen split in half just from everyday use.\\nApparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth  they come loose.\\nAnd it is impossible to get them back in.\\nStrengths Wellshaped\\nWeaknesses A bad videocard \\nAfter 2030 min the screen of the notebook switched off.\\nIt was still working  but there was nothing on the screen.\\nI was said it s videocard.\\nVery disappointed \\nDidn t expect to repair it at once \\nDon t buy this model.\\nAn absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will.\\nMine came at $1 700 w/o a DVD burner  .\\nThe screen is framed by half to a fullinch margin that is obviously unnecessary  reduces the screen size and increases the bulk.\\nThe 4 USB ports are nice  but the two on the side only work now and then.\\nKeyboard could use some trimming.\\nDid I mention everything about it  from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK \\nI m glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC.\\nThe benefits were immediate \\nAwesome graphics \\nThe magnetic plugin power charging power cord is great  I even put it to the test by accident  excellent innovation \\nThis laptop rocks  only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD  which Apple doesn t support \\nI ve saved a lot of time and headaches so far  using my new MacBook Pro.\\nI have never had any issues or problems with my MacBook Pro so far  and it is still as fast as it was when I first bought it.\\nI especially like the backlit keyboard.\\nIt makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier.\\nIt is also very lightweight  making transporting this computer very easy.\\nThe graphics on this computer are also stellar  very clear and vivid.\\nI use iphoto all the time  which is a great program for anyone who is into photography  amateurs and experts alike.\\nThe program came with the computer and works beautifully.\\nI definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails.\\nMy hp G60244dx died after only 16 months.\\nIt started out getting hot after only a few months.\\nAt 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes.\\nI use a cooling pad but it doesn t help.\\nI took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it.\\nI will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro \\nIt fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing.\\nThis is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it \\nThe MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile.\\nI love it \\nI even got my teenage son one  because of the features that it offers  like  iChat  Photobooth  garage band and more \\nWe are addicted to the Mac.\\nThis is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone.\\nThe OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it \\nGreat laptop that offers many great features \\nLightweight and the screen is beautiful \\nIt is easy to operate and I have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new Rolls Royce of laptops.\\nBuy it  love it  and I promise you won t regret it.\\nThis computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life.\\nYou will regret it if you buy any dell.\\nDell sucks\\nThe only pro to this computer is it was under $600 \\nEverything is falling apart internally and externally.\\nWith in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down.\\nI am constantly trying to uninstall programs  clean cookies  and delete unused files.\\nNightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan.\\nMore times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection  or the page can t be displayed.\\nIt takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site  then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works.\\nI have Vista  so I am unable to install and uninstall\\xa0 some programs.\\nI can t even install one of the 3 printers I have in my house so I am unable to print.\\nExternally the keys on my keyboard are falling off  after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit  and the screen has a terrible glare.\\nIn short I would never buy a Compaq again.\\nI bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it \\nIt was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to.\\nThe online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a PC.\\nThe performance is awesome.\\nI will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar.\\nWith all the goodies inside this machine  it is a value.\\nIt is very well built.\\nThe keyboard is top notch.\\nThe touch pad is among the best.\\nThe screen is huge and coloful  but no LED backlighting.\\nThe video card is great for media  and above average for gaming  but not a gamers first choice.\\nThe problem I had with this unit was unresolvable.\\nIt had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use  and would not move past this error.\\nI acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card  but still requires a return.\\nSorry Toshiba  but 1st impressions do count for something.\\nI got the black MacBook two years ago and have never regretted it.\\nSo this was great for me.\\nIt has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs.\\nPlus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work.\\nI also travel with it and it never gives me any problems.\\nBut I am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it.\\nI look forward to years of use  it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well.\\nThe difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space.\\nIt s super fast and a great value for the price \\nI would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one.\\nA MONTH LATER  we reinstall the OS  Vista .\\nA coupla months later  they change my hard drive.\\nA month or so ago  the freaking motherboard just died.\\nWent silently.\\nOne night I turned the freaking thing off after using it  the next day I turn it on  no GUI  screen all dark  power light steady  hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.\\nTHE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD  \\nAnd I m still paying the bloody financing  for a product which didn t last me at least three years  \\nI initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13  in April  and I loved it.\\nI was so happy with my new Mac.\\nThen the hard drive failed;\\nmy information was all lost  my fault  I know  but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac  the paragon of all computers \\nSo  after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer  until it froze this morningcompletely.\\nI can t even turn it off.\\nIt s catatonic.\\nEven if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if  since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it s  like new  I might have 8 months next time.\\nI would rate this computer at 5 stars  but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.\\nGreat battery  speed  display.\\nIt WORKS \\nMy house is now 100  Macbook.\\nThe Macbook starts fast  doesn t crash  has a fantastic display  is small and light  I have the 13.3  model  and isn t always complaining about updates  lost connections  errors  blue screens  etc.\\nTHIS is what a laptop is supposed to be.\\nI thought the price was great for the specs.\\nBut after using it a couple of weeks  the overall operation is poor.\\nI hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it.\\nThe keyboard is too slick.\\nI really don t like it  but I am stuck.\\nDell Latitude d620 is not a reliable machine.\\nThe battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months  stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.\\nLater it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.\\nThe machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.\\nVERY disappointing \\nI was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain Flash.\\nWeb access through the 3G network is so slow  it s very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.\\nAfter purchasing this thing  I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera  and that it cannot be purchased at the store  only on line.\\nHP Pavilion DV9000 Notebook PC      When I first got this computer  it really rocked.\\nBut as time went on I found it almost impossible to keep the thing online through wifi.\\nEventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on.\\nGuess I ll stay away from HP.\\nMy MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made.\\nI have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it.\\nThe most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me  but I have just been using firefox instead.\\nI love this computer.\\nIts small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere  but still has a big enough screen to get everything done.\\nThe only thing that I don t like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to.\\nGames being the main issue.\\nIt drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can t play it because its not compatable with the software.\\nOther than that I don t have one complaint in the world \\nThis computer periodically crashes  Office  IPhoto  Safari .\\nIt takes a long time to get on the Web and to change Web Sites.\\nLocks up she searching for updates.\\nIt seems that this computer might be a lemon.\\nI purchased my Macbook Pro Retina from my school since I had a student discount  but I would gladly purchase it from Amazon for full price again if I had too.\\nThe Retina is great  its amazingly fast when it boots up because of the SSD storage and the clarity of the screen is amazing as well.\\nBut if you buy this i would highly recommend that you buy a case and screen protector for this machine as they are known to be quite fragile.\\nCount me as extremely satisfied  it s a perfect computer.\\nI just bought this computer from the Apple Store  and I couldn t be more impressed with it.\\nIt has a stunning

computer for that purpose.\\nMy daughter uses it for college too and it works great for both of us.\\nSo i gave this 4 stars but only because of the poor picture quality  other than that it is a great buy \\nThis laptop is absolutely horrible.\\nI bought it simply for Excel on Windows for work since I have a Macbook Air and literally the thing freezes and lags opening Excel or my web

actually meets minimum computing expectations for 2014.\\nI appreciate the effort to hit affordable pricing Dell but just not worth it.\\nIt is slow and complicated and very disappointing\\nGreat

laptop that had A  a side keyboard.\\nB  a DVD/CD player.\\nC  a large hard drive instead of using the Cloud\\nD  was under $300 with shipping.\\nThe only con is Windows effin 8.\\nStill giving it a 5 star rating because it is fast and a nice sized screen.\\nGreat for web design and general work.\\nOverall good but processing power isn t very good.\\nW7 Pro with W8 pro upgrade is nice  but it frequently freezes for a few seconds here and there.\\nI replaced stock drive with WD Black 7K drive and is still quite slow.\\nBattery doesn t last long web browsing  2.5 hours maybe .\\nIt has some bloat wear that I wish weren t there.\\nIt works fine for a PC in this price range.\\nI bought it for my parents  late 60s  and they love it  particularly the keyboard and screen.\\nTerrific value for the money.\\nLove the key layout and the builtin mouse pad  all work well and are properly sized.\\nHighly recommended.\\nworks good but doesn t seem like it s made sturdy.\\nkinda to light and plastic feeling.\\nKiller computer.\\nI would highly recommend this computer it is FAST \\nDoesn t have touch screen but I have a tablet so that wasn t so important.\\nLook and feel is good.\\nI am experiencing the system little slower than what I have expected.\\nAnd processor feels pressured even though I run medium scale programs  watching the way exhaust speed increases.\\nThe hdd has a scratching noise.\\nThe system sometimes lags a lot.\\nI don t like it at all...\\nI can t put a protector to make presentation...\\nA good value on a quality product.\\nEasy setup  and delivers all the functions we need.\\nThis laptop is amazing \\nDespite the fact that there s no optical drive  everything is perfect.\\nThe screen resolution is crystal clear  the speakers are amazing  and the track pad is easy to use.\\nThe home page/startup is easy to navigate which is the one thing I was mainly concerned about.\\nInternet is fast and reliable  battery life lasts a long time.\\nI love this laptop \\nLOOKS LIKE THIS DELL IS A PIECE OF CRAP.\\nIT DOES NOT TURN ON  IF I TAKE THE BATTERY OUT IT MIGHT WORK  NOT SURE IF IT S A BAD BATTERY OR COMPUTER \\nDO NOT RECOMMEND \\nAwesome laptop \\nBootup time is amazing  battery life is decent and it has a great slim form factor.\\nThere is somewhat of a learning curve  but the operating system  and hardware of this Mac are great.\\nMore than enough for my use.\\nThe display is vibrant and clear  the keyboard is well designed and pleasant to type on;\\nI even installed a windows partition to be able to run Windows software.\\nThings just work  they are fluid  easy to use and understand  fast and work well.\\nThis computer is absolutely perfect for web browsing  watching video  word processing  and that s about it.\\nIf you want a computer that plays games or any advanced tasks like editing video  this computer is NOT for you.\\nNow when I say don t expect to play games on it  I mean it.\\nPretty much every major game save for Solitare won t even play on it due to the slower processor.\\nIts also worth noting that there no bluetooth  no mircophone jack  no ethernet  no dvd/cd drive/burner  and no usb 3.0 ports.\\nIt DOES come with two usb 2.0 ports  a hdmi port  and a webcam.\\nThe webcam is nothing special  its there if you need it.\\nDon t expect it to take good pictures or video.\\nThe battery is pretty soild.\\nIt lasts up to 56 hours with normal use.\\nThe computer itself runs very quiet and is mostly cool to the touch.\\nThe only major negative to me is Windows 8.1  though YMMV  and the Dell crapware installed.\\nNot bad for the price.\\nI needed an inexpensive laptop to do basic office work on that was lightweight and this fits the bill just fine.\\nPerformance wise  it s a bit slow  but that s to be expected from a Celeronclass processor.\\nI m also not a fan of Windows 8  but fortunately I can install whatever I want on the laptop without issue.\\nLove everything about this laptop \\nSound  quality and touchscreen are awesome \\nI would definitely recommend this \\nI love this laptop to the moon.\\nMy favorite colors black and red  the matte material and the red backlight of the keyboard.\\nThe sound is great and it s fast.\\nThe laptop is beautiful  not extremely light but thin enough and wide screen with a full keyboard.\\nThe touch screen response is fast and it picks up bluetooth and wifi FAST.\\nMicrosoft Office is a 30 day trial  a number of games and apps are already preloaded.\\nIt s exactly like the picture and I AM SATISFIED.\\nGreat laptop light and very versatile\\nit was easy to set up.\\nI like the number pad for work so that s nice\\nThis is going to be random and unorganized  but here are my thoughts on the laptop So far so good after a month.\\nIt took some getting used to on the Widows 8.1  after being an XP user for many years.\\nEverything seems to be running smoothly.\\nOnly downfall is the preloaded McAfee and other software.\\nThey are fine while the free subscription is going  but a pain when they start asking you to spend money every time you login.\\nDevice is light weight  quiet during operation and produces little to no heat.\\nIt has a quick start up and shut down time.\\nThe display is good quality.\\nJust wish there were more USB ports.\\nI AM IMPRESSED WITH THIS COMPUTER  INEXPENSIVE BUT QUALITY.\\nLOVE THE SIZE  I AM USING THIS FOR WORK  I AM A NURSE AND HAVE TO CHART DAILY  THIS IS EASY TO USE AND I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT.\\nIt s so damn good I bought 2  D\\nIf you re the type of person that just likes to browse the Internet and enjoy media and do light work with Microsoft office  this is the laptop for you.\\nDon t expect it to be a champion performer so if you want to play games or whatever this is not the computer for you.\\nIt s extremely light weight and slim because of the lack of an optical drive  who uses those anymore anyways  so it easily fits into any college students bag.\\nI would recommend this to anyone who doesn t need much out of a computer.\\nI am very happy with this computer.\\nIt is exactly what I expected  and the price is excellent \\nYou are getting what you pay for and in my opinion  it is worth more.\\nBeen using it for about 4 hours now and it seems plenty fast and does everything I need it to do.\\nIts a very basic laptop.\\nI thought it would have a CDrom drive  but there isnt one.\\nAlso wish it had a port to plug an internet cord into it because sometimes my wifi router likes to not work.\\nBut for the price its good.\\nOther than the slow CPU it works great for everyday use.\\nHeavy gaming is definitely not it s strong point.\\nThe cover is a soft rubber texture without the friction.\\nSlick design and looks great.\\nThe machine is easy to use  has the power it needs for personal use and some light professional work.\\nIt could be lighter  but couldn t everything.\\nThe battery seems adequate for most uses ~ 4.5 hour use/charge.\\nScreen is clear and bright.\\nGlad it has the DVD drive.\\nPerfectly adequate.\\nGreat PC.\\nThe i7 is incredibly fast  the RAM makes it proper for several games  not on maximum quality .\\nGreat sound quality too.\\nNice laptop.\\nI use it for school  its quick and has everything I need on it.\\nGood battery life as well.\\nWifi card not working right out of the box.\\nDealing with HP support is a ridiculous and painful experience.\\nI have spent more than 2.5 hours on the phone with them  over 4 different calls  only to get no where.\\nNow I m looking into the return process  which I m sure will just be loads of fun  if my prior experience is any indication.\\nSeriously  save yourself the hassle and purchase from a different company.\\nUsed to love HP products  but this has soured me on the whole company.\\nBy far the best laptop I ve ever had.\\nIts fast  powerful  screen display is top notch and the battery life is excellent for a laptop of this size.\\nMy only concern is that since the battery is not external  I will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time.\\nI wonder if thats just Apples way of saying its time to get the newest and greatest laptop 34 years from now lol.\\nThe product is average and works well.\\nWorks at a decent speed.\\nThe mouse pad however is very loud which is why i gave it four stars.\\nI had a great experience purchasing my Dell Inspiron i35311200BK 15.6Inch Laptop.\\nMy laptop was easy to setup  and I ve had no problems to date.\\nDid not disappoint me at all.\\nLenovo is the best laptop.\\nBuilt in mike is really poor and unusable for Skype or any other purpose.\\nAnd the only microphone input is for a combo Mike/Speaker plug.\\nSo to communicate I need to wear ear plugs or a headset with a builtin mike.\\nThat s a nuisance for family Skype calls...only one can speak at a time.\\nWe haven t used it enough or had it long enough to give it 5 stars  but so far it has been a very good laptop.\\nSeveral other reviewers made comments on the keyboard and now I can understand why  this keyboard is the nicest to use of any laptop we ve ever owned.\\nI m a lifelong desktop computer user  and the keyboard on this laptop is as close to a  normal  keyboard as I ve ever seen.\\nWe like this new laptop  a lot \\nVery good performer for the price.\\nNot blazing fast  but quick enough.\\nOne really nice thing about Lenovo laptops is that they are not cluttered with a bunch or trial software.\\nThe desktop was clean once I got it up and running.\\nBattery life is above average  and it charges quickly.\\nKeyboard is sturdy.\\nThe touch pad takes a little getting used to as the  click  buttons are on top instead of the bottom.\\nI will be considering Lenovo for all future laptop purchases.\\nThis lap top is good so far.\\nIt is quiet runs smoothly.\\nI really like the video option on it  I stream movies on Amazon Prime and Netflix and there is no lag.\\nThe only negative would be that it gets pretty warm sitting on my lap for very long  but that is pretty much standard for all lop tops I think.\\nit stopped working 31 days after purchase.\\nit was slow and might be problematic.\\ni would shop around for a better one.\\nCRASHED only 2 days from getting it \\nSays it is failing hard drive.\\nI should have bought something better.\\nThe PC is works well with a good battery and a power cable  and has a web cam.\\nHowever  it does not have a DVD drive  neither does it afford one the opportunity to connect an external DVD drive as the manufacturer did not make any point ofconnection of an external drive.\\nOther than a hate of windows 8  she just loves it.\\nThe plastic materials are rather cheap.\\nLOVE IT \\nNEEDS MORE INSTRUCTIONS WITH IT\\nI m very happy with my Acer  it does just for what I need it.\\nEven the sound is fantastic\\nI love this laptop.\\nEven my extremely tech savvy boyfriend was impressed with the features and sleek design.\\nAlthough I ve had it for less than a week  I am very satisfied.\\nFunctions well.\\nDoes all that was advertised.\\nIf it had a 4 5 star option  that is what I would give.\\nThe build is perfect  the screen fantastic  but I do have a bit of a problem with the fact that I have to buy adaptors for nearly everything  from vga cables to ethernet cables  so  almost perfect...\\n1.Great display.\\nLove the color accuracy.\\n2.Very decent speakers.\\n3.Fairly fast.\\n4.Loud fan when watching 4K video off YouTube.\\nSounds like a washer.\\nMachine gets fairly hot near the bottom of the screen.\\nBattery power laptop had difficulties computing.\\n6.Still feels too heavy to me.\\nCould lose another pound or two.\\n7.Expensive.\\nPaid close to $2800 out the door.\\nBiggest piece of junk I have ever purchased.\\nThis clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered.\\nIt would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for 5 minutes.\\nThe second one  after a little over a month  refused to turn on even with a full charge.\\nWhat a lemon \\nThis is a big disappointment.\\nI only use a laptop for personal use  but this one can t even handle that \\nIt takes a long time to load any page.\\nI ve had it for a minth and so far it s shut down completely 3 times.\\nI have had Dell Desktops for years  so had no qualms about buying a Dell laptop.\\nNever again.\\nI ve always sworn by dell.\\nSo with this new order  all the upgrades and windows 8 really caught my eye and I got this for the long haul.\\nI am not ultra tech savvy but I can tell when it works slow \\nI barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load.\\nI m so disappointed.\\nIn two months  both the power cord pin broke  the company replaced it  and then the CD drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into a million pieces.\\nIn addition  no matter what I do to change the settings  add/delete Flash  etc.  Firefox hangs on startup.\\nIt seems like Lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on.\\nThe cords always feel like they are in my way.\\nOne positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard  which is larger than usual.\\nIt s a pleasure to type on.\\nMy final thoughts  if you are a Mac user  stay away.\\nIf you want to travel with this laptop  don t buy it.\\nIt s clunky  heavy  and a pain to start up and shut down.\\nGreat for games\\nIt s truly a great laptop for the price.\\nHowever  this laptop far exceeded my expectations when I bought it for college  I only use Malwarebytes and Microsoft Security Essentials  run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years.\\nFor $250  which is as much as my graphics card alone cost  this laptop is an incredible value.\\nIt is quite impressive at multitasking  which really surprised me.\\nI can have tabs open while playing YouTube videos and it handles it impressively well.\\nBUT I should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen  it s certainly good enough for the average person  but if you re used to good screens this may bother you a bit  but it s certainly not unbearable by anyone s standards.\\nIf you want to game  this thing can handle League of Legends on mediumlow settings  but I certainly wouldn t recommend it for gaming.\\nOverall  a great laptop for simply doing basic things and webbrowsing.\\nWould definitely recommend for those who are  technologically ignorant \\nthis computer is very slow\\nI love this laptop \\nIt does everything I need it too \\nVery good price.\\nVery nice computer\\nImmediately didn t like the track buttons.\\nThey are loud and clunky but I figured I d get used to it.\\nThe laptop died two days after I received it.\\nI purchased a  Dell Inspiron I35311200BK and so far I love it  this model has a true life monitor  which is worth the extra bucks.\\nIf you re looking for a basic PC this is the way to go.\\nThe hinges on this PC are nice and tight and well made like the rest of the PC.\\nI was surprised  at  the overall quality and the price\\nIn all my life i have never come across a computer as slow as this one  it cant perform basic operations and is practically useless.\\nI just received the laptop and if it runs like this already cant imagine how it would work in the next couple of weeks.\\nIt took almost 20 minutes to boot up.\\nPlease people dont make the same mistake i did.\\nThis is a complete waste of money  dont let the price fool you \\nWould be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly.\\nIt was not responsive at all to touch.\\nAnd while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work  your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse.\\nIf they can fix this  I think it would be a very nice  costeffective laptop.\\nThis laptop broke within the first hour of use.\\nThe  A  key became jammed so that sometimes it wouldn t press in.\\nDell claims they test each key with thousands of mechanical key strokes.\\nAlso  after restarting the laptop it constantly made high pitched electronic noises.\\nI m sure I just got a bad egg  but instead of getting a replacement I decided to try a different one.\\nThis laptop is nice.\\nIt has a decent feel to it  sharp display and is fast enough.\\nThe biggest problem I have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive.\\nI have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available  but nothing has helped.\\nAlso  the touchpad is almost  sticky  which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad.\\nI would love to keep this laptop  but will be sending it back and looking for a different brand.\\nNo Lenovo for me.\\nInitially I liked the product so much.\\nAlthough it was slow but I felt it was ok for the price you have bought it.\\nBut now I am having battery problems.\\nLaptop automatically shuts down when battery life reaches 30 .\\nI am not satisfied with the product.\\nIt s an amazing laptop.\\nMost of the things about the laptop is awesome except the touchpad.\\nThe laptop is fast.\\nThe Windows 8.1 used to boot in just 2s and that was freaking awesome.\\nNow I have dual booted my laptop to Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 and it s not got too slow either.\\nI am loving it completely.\\nIt does make a little noise but that s alright as it s not too much.\\nIt doesn t get heated up much even after continuous usage.\\nBut the  touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever I am typing  my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it s really annoying.\\nI prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad  i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else.\\nA smaller touchpad would make life easier for Computer Science students or IT people much more easier.\\nUhhhhhh  the computer looks good.\\nBut  it works really slowwwwww \\nIt has got me feel like to take years to successfully open a web page.\\nPurchased it for my birthday and love it \\nI m so glad that I have.\\nIt s been a very easy transition moving my Windows created files over to the Mac.\\nSo far I haven t lost any quality or information.\\nI have a little bit of a learning curve with the keyboard shortcuts.\\nBut other than that  I really am loving the quality and speed.\\nExpensive but worth it.\\nThe display has a great resolution but have difficulty always seeing the small print.\\nHaven t quite figured out how to make the font size larger overall.\\nThis is without a doubt the worst laptop I ve ever had.\\nAnd of course  the return window closed last week so now  I m stuck with it.\\nI will never buy another Lenovo anything \\nUnless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop  don t buy this.\\nThe touchpad hasn t worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning  I thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads I ve worked with have some inherent oddities.\\nThis one however  is now very loose and I have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work  Then suddenly  I can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own.\\nToday  it hasn t worked at all more than it has.\\nIt hangs  freezes and just isn t working properly.\\nI have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open \\nThough I don t have much installed  I only have 96 of the 278G left \\nI have no idea what s taking up all the room  it doesn t make sense.\\nI could go on and on  but suffice it to say  if you want to spend $400  on a laptop  don t buy this one \\nIt s definitely not worth the money.\\nVery fast and good for most steam games.\\nDon t expect great graphics  though.\\nThe keyboard and sound are great  and the matte screen works well.\\nCan run CS GO at 60 fps on low settings.\\nComputer was DOA.\\nTurned it on and it was beeping.\\nI love this laptop.\\nLooks good   well built  and very good speed.\\nNeeded a 2 usb adapt. for network plug  no problem.\\nKeyboard is nice and windows 8.1 is great  worried about that coming from xp.\\nPrice makes this the laptop I was looking for.\\nSo far I am very happy with this computer.\\nIt has everything I wanted built in WiFi connectibility  a slot for my SD camera memory card  a DVD burner  big beautiful screen  plenty of USB ports  three 3.0 and one 2.0  and a keyboard with a nice touch.\\nI liked the fact that it came with Windows 7  but also included Windows 8 to install later if I need it.\\nThe price was good.\\nI use a wireless mouse  but the touch pad and the  red button  in the middle that works like a little  joystick  also work fine.\\nI wish I had bought this sooner \\nThis is a great bargain.\\nYes  it s running and old type processor so  hey  don t even try gaming on it.\\nBut  if you are just an average user  it works really great.\\nThe screen is good  the whole things is very light and doesn t run hot.\\nI m very happy with it  typing on it right now and it is fast enough for that \\nI like everything about this laptop.\\nIt has no way of connecting to the internet save wifi but that s all I use anyway \\nI put that free app on for word processing and it works like a charm.\\nI plugged it into my existing printers and it just worked  no fuss no muss.\\nIt immediately recognized the printer and was ready to go.\\nExcellent buy.\\nThe worst computer I have ever laid my eyes upon.\\nFirstly  it has no leds to let you know what is going on  no cap lock  no hard drive indicator  nothing.\\nOk  one light to let you know if the damn thing is on.\\nThe biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it  even when the strength bar is filled.\\nAlso  when you try to download a large file  like a video  it will start out normally  downloading at around 600kb/sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around 20kb/sec  making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless.\\nToo often I would find it not being able to stay connected to the internet.\\nI was unable to download iTunes to it.\\nDell support was awful to deal with.\\nAnd the settings are simply annoying.\\nJust not for me.\\nThe computer is as expected  and worth the money.\\nThe 8.1 windows is a major disappointment.\\nOperating a non touch screen on this system is a royal pain \\nIt came with no instruction book  no back up CD s and has already crashed.\\nHands down one of my best and most used purchases thus far.\\nThe Mid2014 MacBook Pro does no disappoint...\\nRetina screen  solid build quality  weight  fast processor and the reliability of the Apple brand.\\nCons Honestly zero con s ... as a Windows PC user the switch over was seamlessly   I run Parallel when I need Windows.\\nAll my devices work flawlessly.\\nI m an amature  so this does more than I can handle.\\nI m perfectly satisfied  just have to get use to the new 6.1 system I can t see a problem.\\nI  doi9ng fine now  and happy as a bug.\\nThe price is great and it does everything I want to do   Thanks.\\nIt s perfect \\nIt s great for what he uses it for.\\nI am really not happy with this computer...\\nI don t like WINDOWS 8 but that is no fault of the computer but the keyboard is so hard to get the keys to work and the space bar.\\nWould not buy it again.\\nMeh...but cheap.\\nThe first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus.\\nNow the graphics are not HD...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic  medium low grade  plastic.\\nSo if you don t have kids  or not in high school or don t accidently sit on it  it should be fine.\\nNow the speed is disappointing.\\nStart up is fine  maybe 20 secs at most  but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times.\\nEven for a 4GB RAM it barely chugs with 3 tabs open.\\nAll in all I wish I had waited a bit.\\nThis laptop is amazing \\nWindows 8.1 has its pros and cons.\\nThe keyboard is backlit but you have to press the F5 key to turn it on.\\nOf course this will decrease your battery life.\\nThe sound is very nice and crisp.\\nAlso  I have no regrets about going with the 8GB RAM because its super fast.\\nI m still exploring the various features but overall I am satisfied with my purchase.\\nThe HP Envy 15 has been everything I expected.\\nAfter doing much research for a laptop that had all the features I was looking for  This one hit all the criteria I had.\\nThe laptop is very responsice with the Core i7 processor and 8GB of RAM and the sound out of the Beats audio is great.\\nI would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a top performing laptop.\\nused 6 times black screen returned for refund\\ndo not use the facial recognition\\nWindows 8 is not supported by a lot of things \\nThe Dell is quick enough  sturdy  not good with finger prints.\\nIt does what it advertises.\\nPrice is great  wish it didn t have Windows 8  but that is an opinion.\\nI would recommend it  for anybody needing a reliable simple laptop.\\nI bought this for my daughter to use for school and homework  it s not a  fast  computer  but it s great for what she needs it for and very light weight \\nLove the price too \\nWell  my first apple computer and I am impressed.\\nWorks well  fast and no reboots.\\nGlad I did so far.\\ns....

I m lost for words.\\nThis is the best switch I have ever done.\\nThis has much more memory and ram memory.\\nEven the battery life is like WOW \\nI love  LOVE  LOOOOVE \\nI can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied.\\nIt contains a long battery life  incredible specs  and an overall enjoyable performance.\\nUpgrading from a toshiba laptop  I am fully impressed with all of the benefits that the mac operating system provides.\\nThe snappy processor allows for me to quickly upload photos and videos  as well as create movies for me and my colleagues to enjoy.\\nIn upgrading to this computer I can say I have found little to any flaws in the product  hence the 5 star review.\\nLove this computer.\\nIt has done everything and more that I expected.\\nI am sure it will be able to do all I need it to do in the future as well.\\nThe screen looks great in my opinion the sound is nice.\\nSo far I have no complaints and dont expect many complaints in the future.\\nThis did give some set trouble and i had to call tech support.\\nThey were great.\\nits been easy breezy since then.\\nhow could you not love a Mac\\nso far so good  i have not encountered any issues with this computer.\\nlove the flip feature and the touch screen feature.\\nfor the price that i paid i feel that i got good value.\\nthis lap top is not the lightest you can purchase  so if that is important to you maybe you should shop some more.\\nTo a prospective buyer   08/10/2012  Once you go Mac  you ll never go back.\\nWas the best decision we ever made.\\nIt runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems \\nWe don t have to defrag  deliete cookies  run security programs  or any of the common PC problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed.\\nYou can t get a virus on Mac  so in the long run the cost of the Mac is saved by not buying security  and not having to replace your computer every year or two.\\nNever had any issues  no frustrations just great easy wireless  all in one fun \\nIt s great.\\nbecause it is a touch screen you don t even need a mouse.\\nYou will probably never use it in tablet mode but it s nice to know you have that option.\\nIf you draw on the other hand i m sure you will love using this in tablet mode.\\nLastly  because it can flip 360 you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard.\\nThis computer is great.\\nI have a 250 GB SSD and 10 GB of RAM in it  which I installed myself.\\nIt runs faster than it did when I got it.\\nI enjoy the simplicity and userfriendly interface of Yosemite.\\nI m excited for El Capitan.\\nThe apps are very easy to use.\\nThe resolution is excellent.\\nI am very satisfied with EVERYTHING about this machine.\\nLike so many others who do this there is a learning curve and I m excited to do it.\\nThis MBP is clean  neat  and simple.\\nI like that.\\nIt takes less time to power up  and if you just close the case it go into sleep mode.\\nWHen you open it wakes up almost immediately.\\nVery nice.\\nI am pleased with my decision  however I have only had this for a few weeks.\\nThere are a few things I am dissappointed with though.\\nOnly 2 USB ports.\\nNo HDMI port.\\nThe headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone.\\nNot a big deal for me  but if you Skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a Mac.\\nAs a student majoring computer science  I really fell in love with this laptop.\\nIt s 15.6 inches  which for me is not too big nor too small.\\nIt has the latest i7 CPU with a GTX 950M for GPU  which makes this laptop blazing fast  boots up in under 5 seconds  with the help of the SSD of course .\\n It has 256GB SSD which is just enough for my OS  games  documents  and anything in between.\\nIt also has an extra bay for an extra HDD if you wish to add one.\\n It s not touchscreen \\n Its keyboard is nicely arranged  silent  and backlit which is nice  but what I don t like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers.\\nI have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good.\\n This laptop is so silent  its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load  thanks to the 5th generation Intel core which draws less power   thus less heat.\\n It can run games really well.\\nWell  not really well.\\nMOBAs like Dota 2 and SMITE can be run on max quality settings with 60 fps or more.\\nMedium settings on titles like Tomb Raider for it to be acceptable  60 fps is the minimum acceptable fps #pcmasterrace .\\n It s lightweight and easy to carry around.\\n The screen is a matte 1080p display  which is nice  but with poor viewing angle.\\nI find myself adjusting it regularly.\\n It looks sleek and gorgeous.\\nBlends in with any accessory you use with it.\\nAll in all I am very happy with this purchase.\\nAnd with this price  I don t think you can buy anything better.\\nAll I can say is I am impressed.\\nVery quick to get it up and running with a minimum setup time right after you open the box.\\nIt s worth it.\\nPay me now  Pay me later.........I am happy with my choice going with this laptop.\\nI was disappointed.\\nIt seemed like a great computer and a great deal.\\nThe first one arrived and it did not work.\\nThe space bar sticks.\\nI find it hard to navigate from screen to screen.\\nFor a noncomputer savvy person  it was very disappointing.\\nI like the 13 inch macbooks.\\nIts size is ideal and the weight is acceptable.\\nThe new Mac OS Mountain Lion has some nice features as wel as the trackpad.\\nI didn t think i would need an optical drive but since i have had it I used it several times.\\nThe magnetic lid and charger is cool and battery indicator on the side is cool.\\nThe mac is light and so compact I thought I would regret not buying a retina display  not in the least The mac pro works just fine.\\nThe OS is easy  and offers all kinds of surprises.\\nI ve been using Apple s since 1992 and this is the fastest and best one I ve  had.\\nThis Mac allows all of that.\\nThis is very fast  high performance computer.\\nThis should be more than  enough computer for almost everyone.\\nI would not hesitate recommending  this to anyone.\\nIt fast and easy to set up.\\nI had cloned my data from my old computer using  Carbon Copy Cloner  CCC  and simply moved everything to the new computer  and was off and running at speeds I had only dreamed up before.\\nThe Mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized  lazy  and eye candy person in all of us.\\nThe MacBook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like a friendly guide.\\nIf you want to use the Internet  then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen  like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon.\\nThis computer is amazing for the individual who does not want to do any extra work via their understanding of their laptop.\\nI would ve given 5 stars  had it not been for the hours of updates I ve had to do to this upon arrival.\\nOther than that  I love it.\\nIt s portable  reliable  and great for what I use it for.\\nPositives    No matter what position  this laptop will stay in it.\\nIt s very sturdy.\\n Quick bootup  and runs efficiently.\\n Touchscreen is great.\\nNegatives    As aforementioned  my only con was the updates.\\nEverything you d expect from a Mac.\\nIt looks and feels solid  with a flawless finish.\\nThe screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down.\\nOnly had it a few weeks but doesn t leave my side.\\nThis machine is flawless  fast  and classy.\\nOut of all the laptops I have owned  this is by far the best \\nI m not sure if it was covered in the description  but it does have a backlit keyboard and I m getting about an 8 hour battery life on one charge  Except I don t use this for games or videos  which obviously would drain the battery faster .\\nIt wakes in less than a second when I open the lid.\\nThe screen has an extremely high resolution that I m very pleased with.\\nEven though MacBooks are expensive  you will see that they are well worth the money.\\nYou will not regret buying this computer \\nMy daughter s MacBook Air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago.\\nIt took 3 days to make an appointment at the local Apple store.\\nI m not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand $129 for a new battery  $39 to replace it and $139 for a new keyboard.\\nI could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple store myself and asked for a manager.\\nHe explained to me the battery expansion is  normal .\\nApple doesn t cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care.\\nThe battery is simply considered  consumable  and NOT covered.\\nI asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook Air on the internet with the description that Apple doesn t consider the product defective.\\nHis reply astonished me  looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said   Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear \\nHe didn t specify who are  they  but from the tone of his voice and his 6 5  posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS.\\nHere is my take on all of this  the business model Apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from China  hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school  call them geniuses  and bully everybody who complains about their product.\\nSteve Jobs is dead  so is Apple.\\nNo more Apple devices in my household.\\nPlease Google  MacBook battery bulge explode  before you buy your next Apple toy.\\nI ve been spoiled by the build quality and stability of Macintosh and even this used computer is a gem.\\nI can bat around all the things that everyone else says  but it s been what we ve been using for decades and I have nothing bad to say.\\nIt churns out HD content  runs without many flaws and I ve yet to get a virus on a Mac since I started using the platform in the early 1990 s.\\nMy 15&amp;#34; MacBook s motherboard fried but I think that was a sugar spill that I never bothered cleaning up.\\nThat s the only issue I ve ever had since working on Macs in 1995.\\nThat s a pretty impressive track record don t you think \\nHowever  the HP Envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more.\\nI have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all.\\nWhile the price may seem high  it is worth every penny with its many perks.\\nThe Pros   A Ton of Storage Space This laptop comes with 8GB of memory and a 1 TB  1000GB  hard drive.\\nThat is plenty of space for your laptop  which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers.\\n2in1 Capability The ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus.\\nIf you are looking to get a 2in1 laptop  this is the laptop you should consider.\\nI love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies  without having the keyboard in the way of things.\\nI find it much easier to type on and much more durable.\\nBattery Life My battery life is really good with this laptop and I have had no problems with it thus far.\\nI can usually go about 10 hours before I get down to 10  battery life.\\nThe Cons   No Disc Drive Call me old fashioned  but I still enjoy listening to physical CDs and uploading them to iTunes.\\nHowever  I can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive.\\nOverall  I definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop.\\nThe touchscreen and 2in1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes.\\nIt also is nice to be able to play Candy Crush or Angry Birds when in between classes straight from your laptop.\\nIt makes it much more exciting to play \\nI m actually writing this review on my new MacBook and I love it \\nThe computer it self is amazing.\\nIt is an older model  so know that upfront  but it is everything I was looking for.\\nFrom the moment I received this MacBook it was like a dream come true.\\nI know once I upgrade the ram to 8GB it will pick up a lot.\\nAlso  if after reading some reviews and doing some research I found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus.\\nSo long story short  if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop.\\nI know people were complaining that it isn t the newest model  but it all depends on what you are looking for.\\nI highly recommend \\nThis computer is a fantastic tool for word processing  searching the internet  and keeping track of everyday life.\\nIt s also incredibly light  has a battery that can last for days  and looks like a piece of art.\\nThough  that s pretty much what your paying for  a well designed device.\\nWhen you look at the internal specs  the computer is only worth about $500.\\nIt has a 128 GB storage capacity  but with the option of a 256 GB hard drive  and a 1.6GHz dualcore Intel Core i5  so don t expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too.\\nIf your looking to be a trendy hipster who can t live without a Mac  it s a great buy.\\nIt mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don t need.\\nPros    1. Nice Looks.\\n2. Keyboard is great\\nI wanted a simple Full HD display and this one does its job\\n4. Sound is great\\n5. And this has a extra slot for HDD\\n6. No CD drive.\\nCons   1. Web cam.\\nVGA really ASUS \\nYou don t want to show this to anyone  .\\nAnyway I don t use webcam much so   I don t care\\n2. Viewing angles are not great.\\n3. Remember its a dual core.\\n4. The fan kicks in even its not too hot.\\n5.

No anti spyware needed  never had a virus and I never will\\n4. build solid and durable\\n5. bought the 3 year warranty and boy it was needed  because of my doings \\nCons.  1. If you fall behind in updates  your laptop will become progressively slower  just update it...then its back to normal\\n2. Sometimes when I stared mine up it would take a few extra minutes to boot on  other times it is a few seconds\\n3. Cannot manually take battery out  unless you work for apple or have the tools\\nOverall  it is a fantastic laptop.\\nMine has been though hundreds of parties  weddings  quinces  anything involving performances  it can take it \\nThis laptop was made for art  music  beatmaking  pictures  movies  graphic design.\\nBy the way  it comes with apps and hardware that can already support what I had just listed.\\nThis laptop will last you a half decade if not a full decade.\\nSoon I will be hitting the 5 year mark and I think this thing can make it another 5 in my opinion.\\nGet this now \\nBy the way...I paid for this particular laptop roughly 2 grand...LOOK AT THE PRICE NOW \\nThis is a great laptop.\\nI bought it for college and couldn t be happier.\\nThe SSD and I7 complement each other really well.\\nI was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows 10  but it is pretty awesome.\\nIf you are looking for a light  durable  and extremely effecient laptop  buy this one \\nThey really know what they are doing.\\nThe laptop is so easy to work with.\\nLike it was designed for what people would want to the system to do  very userfriendly.\\nIts simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great  aside from its quality design and sexy looks.\\nIf you dont like windows I would suggest trying a Mac.\\nThe investment is worth it.\\nHave bought several laptops in last several years and hands down this has been the best ever.\\nMac User interface is just the best.\\nAlso  the laptop is quite  no more burnt laps  best screen display  and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over.\\nOnly thing I dislike is that everything for Mac is expensive but I guess you pay for quality \\nNot impressed with Macintosh products.\\nIn fact I am completely frustrated.\\nAlso  many software programs are not compatible with the IOS platform.\\nBe sure the programs you need will work on a MAC before you buy one \\nI had heard people speak highly of the MacBook Pro for college students  and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use.\\nThe MacBook Pro is useful for college students for many reasons \\nIt is the cheapest product in the line of MacBook s\\nThe new operating system called Snow Leopard is installed and ready for use\\nThe battery life has increased from the last version from 4 hours to 7 hours  making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger.\\nReliability  Throughout the past few years  I have had no problems with the MacBook Pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws.\\nDurability  My computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it  but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it.\\nUsability  The MacBook Pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who doesn t necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers.\\nThe processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly.\\nThe MacBook Pro has a significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes \\nPros   o It usually runs very smoothly  but Apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers.\\no It has an extended battery life.\\no It is extremely user friendly.\\nCons   o Some people don t enjoy the way the processing system runs  but don t have any issues with getting it to function.\\no Others have problems with the applications depending what they need to use the device for  for example engineering majors need extra applications &amp;

the onboard speakers are just terrible.\\nBut what should I expect from a unit that is this thin and this light \\nThe most disappointing purchase of my life \\nI received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after I purchased this horrible machine.\\nWithin the first few months that I bought it  there was clearly a problem with the hard drive.\\nThe online customer service was awful.\\nGave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile.\\nNo one would ever answer my question as to why I couldn t get another new Macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my Macbook was still under warranty.\\nAs a matter of fact  no matter how many times I asked that question  the employees I spoke purposely ignored it.\\nThey didn t say yes and they didn t say no  they just pretended that I never asked it  which was incredibly frustrating.\\nI ve been to the &amp;#34;genius&amp;#34; bar several times  they have been very nice .\\nThey have now basically replaced everything inside my machine  told me there was a problem with the hardware  so I now have a &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; machine.\\nMaybe I m not being reasonable  but I don t feel that s the same as a new computer because I didn t pay for a refurbished computer.\\nI still have weird freezing problems with it and it s pretty slow  but it s not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in.\\nI had delusions of grandeur regarding Apple s &amp;#34;great customer service&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;reliability of their machines&amp;#34; etc.. etc...blah...blah...\\nI m sure most people s Macbooks work just fine  but FYI  if you get the factory dud  you re stuck with it and no one at Apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away.\\nOne OS for this platform  no OEM OS paraphernalia and automatic updates.\\nI am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the MAC \\nWell she was right  Whatever in the world took me so long to get a computer that just works.\\nI m no power user  but I have had no learning curve with the MAC and I don t do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the OS.\\nI did buy Office 2008 for the MAC at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for $64 and that was  a steal in my opinion.\\nOtherwise I am happily a  Mac user.\\nFor a premium laptop sold in 2013  the Apple MacBook Pro  13 inch  base model  is about as basic as it gets  no SSD  no discrete graphics  no 1080p display  and no touch screen.\\nBut Apple does not pretend it has any of these.\\nWhat it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side  Apple s OSX Mountain Lion  the sleek looks Apple always delivers  reasonable specs  good battery life  nice keyboard  and excellent trackpad.\\nThose looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag  and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs.\\nThe MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac  but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution.\\nThis Mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair.\\nHard drives can be replaced  RAM can be added as needed  and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge.\\nThis  added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money  detracts from the computer s value.\\nLowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a fivestar purchase  but for the price  this is a four star  good  computer.\\nTLDR version  good  reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive.\\nI am really sorry I bought this machine.\\nI was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase.\\nThis machine has made me go there 5 times and has been nothing but a continuous problem.\\nFinally  they are sending it in for a motherboard replacement.\\n It s a lemon .\\nSo  I m cooled on Mac buys.\\nThey did not replace the motherboard.\\nInstead they  tightened  a loose wire.\\nIt also has a big new scratch on the top cover.\\nI started it up and it still has the same problem I went in to fix.\\nSo I m going back to Genius Bar for visit #6.\\nI think it may have to be  Apple Don t Care  instead of Apple Care.\\nYou get what you pay for  right \\nMac is complicated and frustrating at moments.\\nI watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough.\\nI should have known better.\\nI hope you don t make the same mistake...\\nWhen I first got the computer  I noticed the tracking pad was hard to click.\\nI took my Macbook to the Apple store and they had to replace the battery after 1 month of use since it was swelling.\\nThey tried to tell me that the battery wasn t covered by the warranty and it costs about $150 to replace.\\nThey ended up not charging me.\\nOther than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long  I m pretty happy with the computer.\\nI m a designer turned frontend developer and this computer is unusable for frontend development.\\nOpening photoshop takes FOooooooRRREVER  as do all programs that do not begin with an  i .\\nThe free upgrade to Mountain Lion FAILED.\\nIt tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again.\\nBefore and after I resolved that issue  I saw the damn  beachball  all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell it s doing while I wait for it.\\nI spend so much time waiting for it.\\nI can t believe people like these computers.\\nNow that they are not virus free  ... l  I see absolutely no benefit to Apple products as they are slower  more expensive  and do not last as long.\\nDon t waste your money.\\nMy HP seemed great at first  then the problems started.....wireless adapter would just &quot;disappear&quot;

in that case I turn the computer off  then on again  and sign in  problem solved.\\nI ll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself  and just conclude by saying that I m delighted with my purchase.\\nReceived this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed.\\nTo go left I have to go right and vice versa and to go up I have to go down.\\nWhen I attach a mouse it s fine but the touchpad is really annoying.\\nI went through the settings and there isn t a way to fix it.\\nIt s a great laptop  but right now it s annoying to use the touchpad.\\n'"

              "'Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place but not any longer . We there were four of us arrived at noon the place was empty and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude . They never brought us complimentary noodles ignored repeated requests for sugar and threw our dishes on the table . The food was lousy too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny . After all that they complained to me about the small tip . Avoid this place I have eaten at Saul many times the food is always consistently outrageously good . Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn . The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world . The wine list is interesting and has many good values . For the price you can not eat this well in Manhattan . I was very disappointed with this restaurant . Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away . I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested . Food was okay nothing great . Chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family . I/we will never go back to this place again . Went on a day oyster binge with Fish bringing up the closing and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended because it was so great Service was devine oysters where a sensual as they come and the price ca n t be beat You ca n t go wrong here . Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street . Everything is always cooked to perfection the service is excellent the decor cool and understated . I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible . Ca n t wait wait for my next visit . I had my eyes on this place promising myself I will one day ` give it a try . And I hate to say this but I doubt I ll ever go back . The food is very average ... the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet every thing they serve is too sweet here . The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree . I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty LRB could ve used a bit more salt RRB . Anyways if you re in the neighborhood to eat good food I would n t waste my time trying to find something rather go across the street to Tamari . The decor is night tho ... but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite unappetizing and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern . We ate outside at Haru s Sake bar because Haru s restaurant next door was overflowing . What s the difference between the two Their sake list was extensive but we were looking for Purple Haze which was n t listed but made for us upon request The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome great appetizer to share We went around on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great we love th pink pony . THe perfect spot . Foodawesome . Service friendly and attentive . Ambiance relaxed and stylish . Do n t judge this place prima facie you have to try it to believe it a home away from home for the literate heart . i have eaten here a handful of times for no reason besides sheer convenience . LRB i hang out and live in the neighborhood . RRB the food is decent . however it s the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth . i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of selfrespect which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water or the check . i know you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored but my agenda is i m here to eat and enjoy the company of friends seeking a pleasant experience . well i did n t find it there and trust i have told everyone i can think of about my experience . the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty hmmm . This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area . I had a great experience . Food is great . Service is top notch . I have been going back again and again . I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin which was heavenly at sushi rose . It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistencynot too fishy creamy and slightly buttery . The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned . The rice to fish ration was also good they did n t try to overpack the rice . We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it . I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently . She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy . Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth . In the evening this place attracted a well dressed with it NY crowd . The food was well prepared and the service impecable . I m going back . Having hunted around for a quiet romantic yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot . Quite simply it s like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility . The service was attentive yet unimposing the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced . The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough LRB both in quantity AND quality RRB . I will be going back and heartily recommend it I ve had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times when I have been in the neighborhood . It is terrific as is the value . $ and there is much tasty food all of it fresh and continually refilled . I am not a vegetarian but almost all the dishes were great . Frankly when you compare what you can have here for lunch versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city there is no comparison . Go hungry and enjoy . The food here is rather good but only if you like to wait for it . I like the somosas chai and the chole but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing . The service varys from day to day sometimes they re very nice and sometimes not . The kitchen however is almost always slow . Also specify if you like your food spicy its rather bland if you do n t . The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation so a casual lunch here would probably be best . Just went here for my girlfriends bday . If you ve ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer . Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening . The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it . Once you step into Cosette you re miraculously in a small offthebeaten path Parisian bistro . This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets with that certain Parisian flair . The food was average to aboveaverage ; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive and the desserts not brilliant in any way . However go for the ambience and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world I have never eaten in the restaurant however upon reading the reviews I got take out last week . IT WAS HORRIBLE . The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n t even fully melted It looked like shredded cheese partly done still in strips . I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst . This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn . The pizza is overpriced and soggy . Yes they use fancy ingredients but even fancy ingredients do n t make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right . A big disappointment all around . I think I ve had some the best meals of my life at minnow . The seafood is amazing there s a good wine list and the everchanging menu always offers some great surprises . The combination of superfresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious . Worth the trip from Manhattan . Was there Friday night . Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous . And I ve been to many NYC delis . My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it . Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better . As a Japanese native I ve lived in the Tristate area for over years but I was just so amazed at this place . This place is the most Japanese it can ever get . The signs the specials menus food and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese . This place is worth an onehour drive . I am so coming back here again as much as I can . Leon is an East Village gem casual but hip with well prepared basic French bistro fare good specials a warm and lively atmosphere . My wife and I always enjoy the young not always well trained but nevertheless friendly staff all of whom have a story . Sit outside in the warm weather ; inside for cozy winter . Decent wine at reasonable prices . Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience . Our teenage kids love it too . Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES I get angry that I did n t just go to Zucchero Pomodori . This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood . The service is excellent the decor is great and the food is delicious and comes in large portions . You ll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city and most still do n t compare . I m partial to the Gnocchi . This place is incredibly tiny . They refuse to seat parties of or more on weekends . The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive . The food was bland oily . I just do n t understand all the hype ... . We went to Ino for Valentines . We have been to this place many times and always have great food wine and service . We were worried we would have trouble getting in but somehow managed to have a short wait . As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited . When we sat we got great and fast service . The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes . Make sure you try this place as often as you can . This is a fun restaurant to go to . The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere . But the pizza is way to expensive . A large is $ and toppings are about $ each . I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read . Sauce was watery and the food did n t have much flavor . If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants this is not the place for you . I do n t think I would go again . This place is great . I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of . The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal Service was prompt friendly and great . Slightly on the pricey side but worth it Great pizza and fantastic service . There was a small wait but shorter than I expected . Located at the end of a magnificent block . Very cozy and warm inside ... . I will be back This is the best sushi in new york city hands down . The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic . Get the tuna of gari . The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side . Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me I go there usually for the sushi which is great the thai food is excellent too . With the great variety on the menu I eat here often and never get bored . The atmosphere is n t the greatest but I suppose that s how they keep the prices down . It s all about the food I went there with my friend last saturday . first it took us a long time to find the place . we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers . but when we looked at the menu there were n t a lot of choices most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section . then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi . those rolls were big but not good and sashimi was n t fresh . they were dry and disgusting i did n t even finish my first piece . Hurley s is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came . Try the crunchy tuna it is to die for . Try everything for that matter it is all good . I have been going there since it opened and I ca n t get enough . First went here to enjoy their garden terrace . The food was amazing and the service was prompt and helpful but not overbearing or rushed . The Steak Tartare is a great bet they fix it for you at the table . Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm but the open kitchen is part of the charm . Great wine selection Gigondas is worth the price and the house champagne is a great value . It may be a bit packed on weekends but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area . Have recommended the place to friends always gets good response . Pizza the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings the crust tastes like the best freshly baked bread Veal Parmigana Better than Patsy s Much more reasonably priced too I take all my NYC guests to VT s . Not sure where the previous reviewer lonk dined but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food I ve been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences . I d highly recommend it for a special occasion it provides and intimate setting and nice service . I m not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much ... and we re repeat customers . Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there . Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll ... . it s delicious Moules were excellent lobster ravioli was VERY salty Took my mom for Mother s Day and the maitre d was pretty rude . Told us to sit anywhere and when we sat he said the table was reserved . Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting . Tiny dessert was $ ... just plain overpriced for what it is . The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced . Try their chef s specials they are to die for . Service is not exactly five star but thats not really a big deal . Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction . Raga s is a romantic cozy restaurant . The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations . It is also extremely well priced . The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive . The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines . This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed . Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem When we stumbled on Leon we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT we were certainly wrong . The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet we were told no ... . Then to top things off she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend s jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes . Such a disappointment ... . Rude service medicore food ... there are tons of restaurants in NY ... stay away from this one . I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde I loved everythig about itespecially the shows and actors . Our server was very helpful and friendly . I am bringing my whole family back next time . The food was good too . The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent . The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by feet away on avenue on a cool evening was wonderful . Inside is a little cramped but to be expected . Service was prompt and courteous . This was a repeat visit and we ll definitely be back again . Great service great food . Prices are in line . Compared to other shabu restaurants around town this places wins handsdown . But too far east I live a block away and go to Patsy s frequently . The pizza is delicious they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap frozen shredded cheese common to most pizzaria s . Two complaints their appetizer selection stinks it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu . Also because it is so thin it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling . So eat fast and order a lot . Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant . fine dining restaurant quality . Over different choices to create your own . A must try On a recent Sunday afternoon a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT . This was the perfect quiet relaxing and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater . The chicken pot pie is excpetiona the cheeseburger huge and delictable and the service professional wan warm . With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district is truly an excellent find We will return many times for this oasis in midtown . I grew up on these bagels . The staff is no nonsense . The food options rule . When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else . Worth visiting the Ave spot because it is the original store . I stumbled upon this second floor walkup two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. . Being serious sushi lovers we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action . I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni . LRB For those of you who do n t know Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese which happens to be my favorite . RRB He served me an Uni Hand roll which I never had before and let me tell you ... IT WAS HEAVEN Aside from the Sea Urchin the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail Boton Shrimp Blue Fin Torro LRB Fatty Tuna RRB Sea Eel etc. . The sake menu should not be overlooked All in all this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city . Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll . We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $ menu . Service was very good prompt attentive and nonintrusive . Food was very good as well considering that we tried the budget selection LRB though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer so that fat was more of a meltinyourmouth experience RRB . Wine list selection is good and winebytheglass was generously filled to the top . Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation . I ve been to at Cafe Spice probably times it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square . To sum it up Service varies from good to mediorce depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average Ok . Seating is always prompt though the restaurant does fill up in the evening . Food is usually very good though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders . As many other reviewers noticed your order is often slow to arrive this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time . The decor is vibrant and eyepleasing with several semiprivate boths on the right side of the dining hall which are great for a date . I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye . The first time I went and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad . I ve never ordered anything else from their menu ... there s no need to . It s simply the best meal in NYC . You can not go wrong at the Red Eye Grill . If we were to move from the upper east side we would genuinely miss this restaurant . We ve lived in the area for more than years . The restaurant is cute but not upscale . The food is a diamond in rough the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes . I would highly recommend it . It s one of our favorite places to eat in NY . We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night . We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks . After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner . The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile . The place s decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh . I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained this is a great place to go and eat . My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary and to our surprise it was fantastic . The have over different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini . The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner . Please take my advice go and try this place . Its located in greenewich village . You will not be disapointed at all . Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel . We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem . The bagel was huge . They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior . The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese LRB gets a little messy RRB . I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND . This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart s and I must say how delicous the food and the service was . When I called this morning I did n t think I would be able to get in at but I was able to get in along with four other guests . I have to highly recommend the lobster roll not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster . Other guests enjoyed pizza santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips . I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart s for their food the ambience and wonderful service . All the staff is absolutely professional I sometimes see the waiters do n t have enough knowledge of their dishes . But they do . LRB that is A MUST but not every restaurant can do ... RRB . If you want to dine with large party I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT . There s nice and quiet small but enough for LRB or more RRB . This restaurant was way overhyped . My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily . Okayi do n t mind the oily part LRB cause most are cooked that way RRB but it was way too bland . The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary . The service was the only thing good about this restaurant . It s boring on the inside and our sushi was pretty below average ... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor . I definitely would n t go back . There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # . Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic . The price is reasonable although the service is poor . fresh restaurant was amazing ... ... food was delicious and of course fresh . great for a romantic evening or a fun evening with friends ... . I will be going back very soon . keep up the good work . Hats off to the chef . I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food but my friend who took me there is . He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine . It was wonderful . the salads are delicious both refreshing and very spicy . We had Pam s special fried fish and it was amazing . too large for just two people but nothing was left . Unbelievable . Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night . Great vibe lots of people . My husband and I both ordered the Steak medium . My husbands was perfect my was well done and dry . I did n t complain I liked the atmosphere so much . Will give it another chance before I write it off . Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews . On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch . Ambience is so cute and quaint good for business although we were there on vacation . Salads were fantastic . Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great . Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me . We will be back . This is some really good inexpensive sushi . It costs $ extra to turn a regular roll into an insideout roll but the roll more than triples in size and that s not just from the rice . The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I ve had at this price range . The Yellowtail was particularly good as well . I have reservations about the all you can eat deal however the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ by just going off the menu . In any event this is a place I ll be sure to stop by again when I m in this part of town . Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment . They have it all great price food and service . The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can . The food is prepared quickly and efficiently . And it all comes at a very reasonable price LRB congee noodles and rice dishes are no more than $ each RRB . The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well . This place is always very crowded and popular . Went here on a friend s reccomendation . Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese ... both very tasty . We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh . We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake both were delicious . We d go back again . I recently went to this restaurant with some coworkers for lunch and had an amazing time . The staff was accomodating the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely . We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves . Yes the prices are high but I felt it was worth it . We all felt it was worth it . sometimes i get good food and ok service . sometimes i get bad food and bad service sometimes i get good good and bad service . it is not consistent . really depends on your luck The place is a BISTRO which means simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere . And where does Patis go wrong ; no where . You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but Cassuolet Steake Fritte Tripe Stew etc ; simple stuff . And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful . Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza . Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta LRB raddichio was kind of bitter though RRB . My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better . The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day . Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids . Overall I would recommend it and go back again . Coming from Boston this place is like Emma s Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge LRB although they have more funky toppings RRB I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two . For dinner I had the chicken tikkamasala and some garlic naan . MMmmm ... it was delicious . Service was slow but the people were friendly . It s a nice place to relax and have conversation . I ca n t wait to go back . We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant . The food is authentic Italian delicious Pizza is terrific as is homemade pasta . Ambience is delightful service impeccable . I m still mad that i had to pay for lousy food . The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed . Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great . DO not try unless you re just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste . I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try . This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent . The filet mignon dish was superb I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices . It s a small cute restaurant . I absolutely love this place From the street it looks very hidden and is actually an old warehouse . I like the ambience it s very dark and original . I came here for my friend s birthday and keep coming back ever since . The sushi is amazing And amazingly cheap . Big thumbs up Very affordable and excellent ambient We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai . We were very disappointed . We wo n t go to this place again for a good meal . However I think this place is a good hang out spot . Next time we would n t dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks . My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time THe Pizza and wine were excellentthe service too but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area . It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country . They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter so i m looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it . Check this place out HIGHLY RECOMMENDED First of all this place is * not * romantic as claimed by Citysearch s editorial review . Either that or the editor s idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table while trying to speak louder than the traffic on . The tables are crammed way too close the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant and the wine list is simply overpriced . Slightly above average wines start at $ with only one selection listed at $ . Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category . For instance plates were just dumped on the table I was handed the wine list upside down etc ... . Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service . To be completely fair the only redeeming factor was the food which was above average but could n t make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora . To celebrate a birthday three of us went to Mare anticipating great food . Not one of our meals was edible bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring . Fish was overdone . Cute place nice wait staff but would never go there again . Someone else recommended the dessert we also left that . One of us actually liked the expresso that s it . Skip this restaurant it s a big disappointment . Myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City ; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else . I ve never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious . Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for . I come from a family of pizzeria owners and I m almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino s blows my families receipies away . It is simply amazing . The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious . I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try . You will find yourself returning quite often . P.S. Please do n t tell anyone in my family i eat there . LOL . A restaurant that does n t try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere . No gimmicks here the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation . The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over how refreshing The service was impeccable and unobtrusive the staff knows what they are there to do to know their menu present your meal and attend to your needs . Looking around I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen . Beautiful experience . The view is breathtaking the service is top notch ... the ambiance is wonderfull . The staff offers impeccable service . I had Lobster Bisque it has oz of Maine Lobster in it . My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque . I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash . It was divine melts in your mouth . My boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good . We did n t want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough . We had Lava Cake ... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a to make it . It s cuz it s so good you need to taste it All in all we re already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food . If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo . It s very spicy but not offensive . We will definitely go back . Go to Volare for class service and terrific food . The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter . The wine list is excellent . The food is amazing ... especially if you get the Chef s tasting menu and your favourite bottle LRB or two RRB of wine from an extensive selection of wines . The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded but the service is excellent and it s great for friends out a romantic date or a special occassion . People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans . The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n t like . Recommendations of course are required Please be aware that it s CASH or AMEX only With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering the food here was decent not great . The menu is very limited i think we counted or entrees . We ordered the special grilled branzino that was so infused with bone it was difficult to eat . The decor in this place is very dinerish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village not romantic just simple small and sparse . Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable . No plans to return anytime soon . This place is so much fun . Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant . This place must have cost the owners afortune to build . I think the stuff was better than Disney . Our food was great too And really large portions . The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York . We will go back every time we are in the City . If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde . It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects . The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions . I highly recommend it . I am going to the mid town location next . The place is a lot of fun . My six year old loved it . The characters really make for an enjoyable experience . The food however is what one might expect . It is very overpriced and not very tasty . However I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once . We had a good time . Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them . Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded . Drinks way over priced . Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit . Great pizza for lunch place . Service was quick . The pizza was great . And it was quick which is very important . Have the iced tea . It was wonderful . Whenever you need a Sushi fix Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service . Delivery is fast too . Great friendly service Fast seating Fast Delivery Excellent sushi . A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite . Growing up in NY I have eaten my share of bagels . EssABagel LRB either by Stytown or midtown RRB is by far the best bagel in NY . The bagels always warm soft on the inside crispy on the outside and enormous in size . They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great . The lox is always fresh too . Highly recommended to all I have to agree with the previous reviewer . I do n t get it either . Not impressed with the food . Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant . Zero ambiance to boot . I thought this place was totally overrated . Everything we had was good or ok ... but definitely nothing great . The ambience was nice but service was n t so great . When you add it all together it just does n t seem worth it to me ... especially considering the prices . This is the BEST ShabuShabu Restaurant in the TryState Area . I have lived in Japan for years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan . Thius is a must for anyone who loves ShabuShabu . The atmosphere is nothing special but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo . The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance . Despite a slightly limited menu everything prepared is done to perfection ultra fresh and a work of food art . I must give it Yon out of Yon stars Taxan delicious Arigato Gozimas Yuka This restaurant was recommended by a local ... as a matter of fact he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed We were n t The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food . We liked it so much that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York . Went there for an office lunch . The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it . There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me . Try green curry with vegetables . The quantity is also very good you will come out satisfied . The service is ok some of the people did n t get what they asked for . I was there on sat for my birthday and we had an excellent time . I had the best ravioli ever . The wine the service was very good too . Moderate prices . A little noise but I think that was because of our party Molto bene This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list . The food is delicious from the specials to the regular menufare the dishes are never a disappointment . Whether it s the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite . Although the tables may be closely situated the candlelight foodquality and service overcompensate . A guaranteeed delight I have known about this secret for the last years Emilio LRB the Godfather RRB has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices . If you go try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm ... everything is just delicious . Check out the secret back room . Old school meets New world . I pray it stays open forever . Thank You Emilio . Ciao Bella . I found the food service and value exceptional everytime I have been there . The food was authentic . I felt as though I were eating in Paris . The service was excellent friendly and attentive . The prices are wonderfully low . Very good wine choices . I ca n t believe people complain about no cheese sticks Who has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC Get the pepperoni YUM and a family style salad . Great staff . Always great service I go twice a month Fantastic The food is good I ca n t lie . But the staff was so horrible to us . The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out . We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order . This place is pricey and yes the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price . Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one I ll keep this short . Amma is nothing special . The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place . I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive . Will not be back . Do n t dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes they are simply not up to par with the nonveg selections . Decor is nice though service can be spotty . This place is always packed . I know because I live nearby . Most importantly food is excellent . Try the sea bass . Highly recommended . First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks . As a student in NYU i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by . but ive heard a lot about this for the past yrs and finally decided to eat here . I am happy i did the food was awsome . JUST AWSOME . and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs . They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey . but overall i give it a . . I have n t been to the other locations . Haru on Park S is simply disgusting . The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale . Quite frankly this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried . Will never be back . honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives . believe us we ve been eating sushi for over yrs . not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly . the allucaneat sushi is definitely in very poor quality . limited menu nosofresh ingredients thinlysliced fish fallapart rice . the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce LRB even its low sodium RRB the vinegarsoaked rice and the scallion on top of the fish . the waitstaffs are nice though . wont come back again for sure I have been to Roth s twice and both times were very disappointing . Once for dinner and once for brunch . Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service which was boarderline rude . They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another . Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you . The dinner was ok nothing I would have again . I had their eggs benedict for brunch which were the worst in my entire life I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was . This was a great surprise . With the theater blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room . The service was attentive . I look forward to eating here again . Planet Thai is great We love the food drinks and atmosphere The svc can be a bit rude at times esp if you have big group but overall the restaurant is a must Try the Pad Thai it s fabulous and their prices are so cheap Just because it s cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty IT IS GREAT Just remember the later you go the longer you may have to wait . It s popular w/the late crowd . They forgot a sandwich did n t include plastic forks and did n t include pita with the hummus platter . Also the sandwiches LRB nearing $ RRB did n t come with anything like chips or a side . Overall not worth the money . Eating in the atmosphere saves it but at your desk it s a very disappointing experience . I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it . Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city . They have authentic Indian at amazin prices . This restaurant is VEGETARIAN ; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever . The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches . It s a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early . Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff . The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate . This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates . Not a great place for family or general dining . LLOOVVE THIS PLACE . Food is excellent . Fish is so very fresh . Waitstaff are very friendly . Love YUKA . Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood . The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent . The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great . The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing . The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices . Even though its good seafood the prices are too high . The lobster sandwich is $ and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price . Went to Village last night for my birthday . We picked it randomly without a recommendation from someone who has been there so we were n t sure what to expect . We were very pleasantly surprised . The food was delicious LRB I had a halibut special my husband had steak RRB and the service was topnotch . When my dessert came there was a candle in it not because anyone asked for one but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort . Truly the mark of an attentive waiter . I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night . We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods . We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods . Why They do n t concern much of customer s health just want to make money . please do n t fool us . I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke . I recommend the jelly fish drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings certainly the stir fry blue crab . The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice . Of course it is crowded but who cares . Authentic Shanghai style and I can not recommend a better Shanghai place in New York . Have frequented ` ino for several years and the food remains excellent . Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ . The large selection of bruschettas paninis tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating . LRB The asparagus truffle oil parmesan bruschetta is a winner RRB Wine list is extensive without being overpriced . Be sure to try the seasonal and always delicious specials . Definitely a neighborhood favorite . I loved this place I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded . The food was very good a great deal and the place its self was great . The wait staff is very freindly they make it feel like you re eating in a freindly little european town . I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent The service was terrible we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served . The waitress seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing . After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend asked him Where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in America ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on . We did tip I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager . The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff because despite the current one this is a great place . Pizza here is consistently good . Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal . You should pass on the calamari . It is thick and slightly soggy . Decor is charming . Service is average . What a great place . I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband . The ambience was so fun and the prices were great on top of the fact that the food was really tasty . I was n t thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes but I guess that s the price you pay for a popular place . I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever . A gentleman maybe the manager came to our table and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order . When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants he replied this is not Mcdonald s every place makes things differently . While it is understandable that every place is indeed different there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude . The service was poor restaurant poorly lit staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald s than this joint . Never again I absolutely Loved this place . My friends spoke so much about it for months I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in . Excellent atmosphere delicious dishes good and friendly service . this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions . I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation . The wine list is also really nice . A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around . Everything was wonderful ; food drinks staff mileau . I would highly recommend this place I have been to Casimir over times and I have always had a great time there . The food is great and reasonably priced . I have tried to make reservations but both times the hostess did n t have my name . If the weather is nice try to snag an outside table . The staff has been nice but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often . My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent . From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it . Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed . I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service . Nice Family owned traditional restaurant . Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order . I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken . Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you re with . My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend . I found the food to be outstanding particulary the salmon dish I had . I also ordered the Change Mojito which was out of this world . My friends settled for rice dishes but we came back the following day to try the dim sum which was good ... not outstanding but good . We ate out in the back patio which is worth it as it s cool and the music is hear well there . Overall excellent restaurant i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family . The food was good . The place was nice and calm . but the service was a bit slow . I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time . The buffet had a nice selection . The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes . Service was also very good . I would go back . I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries . I would recommend Roxy s for that but not for their food . My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge But they were too big for the bun . Consequently their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ` nt feel like finishing them . Also they were $ each I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll . It was $ not really bad for a pound of Pastramibut it did n t have much tasteI ve had better for less elsewhere This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant the food . The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish . And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic . If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go . We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday and I was thoroughly impressed with the food . The pesto pizza was excellent thincrust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I d never heard of before . Conveniently located too being right on Bedford ave . THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant where you can see their personal herb garden . I will definetly be going back . We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC . My husband said he could ve eaten several more the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had . We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful . I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one . We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right . We will be back . love the food . it s the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food . it helps if you know what to order . and you ca n t beat the prices . highly recommended . I ve lived in NY for years and this place has it all . Great food good size menu great service and an unpretensious setting . The dishes offered were unique very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages sardines with biscuits large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream LRB the best and freshest I ve ever had RRB . I m glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY . We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and Streets and Joya is the best . The freshest best variety and the fastest delivery . Also very inexpensive . A great choice at any cost and a great deal . The service was excellent and the food was delicious . We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included ceviche mix LRB special RRB crab dumplings assorted sashimi sushi and rolls two types of sake and the banana tempura . Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites but everything was delicious . Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date . Average to good Thai food but terrible delivery . I ve waited over one hour for food . They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice . A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner The food arrived minutes after I called cold and soggy . i actually feel like i should keep it a secret . This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money . An excellent service . Went to Cafe Spice with of my friends on a saturday night . We were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial . She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food . We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry . The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates . We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun LRB dessert RRB recommended by the waiter . I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others . I went here with a friend on a whim we went someplace else first and could n t get a table . Service here was great food was fantastic . Guacamole shrimp appetizer was really great we both had the filet very good did n t much like the frites that came with but the filet was so good neither of us cared . Will absolutely visit again . Maybe tomorrow ;RRB . You can not go wrong with this place . The food is outstanding and the service is quick friendly and very professional . Always a nice crowd but never loud . Go here . Good for dates or with friends . I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded . However it is jus too good to not praise it . By far the best pizza in Manhattan . The crust is thin the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly . For all you lazy folks that do n t want to come to Alphabet City I say good stay out . less wait time for me We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly . The menu has so many fish items and oysters . We all ordered different entrees so we could share . The fish was really really fresh . I lived in Maine for ten years and grew up on fish . We all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York . I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood . All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better I highly recommend the Sophia pizza . It s to die for The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back . Immediately after we paid the waiter took the money and said okay you guys are outta here . There are other people waiting We were n t even at our table for more than an hour total . As we were leaving the couple standing by the door said to another waiter we re not in a hurry . Our friends have not arrived yet . So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary For the people who want great food plus great service Roxy is a place to AVOID I ve been here twice now . The first time the sushi was outstanding the second time it was a little bland . I m sure I ll return for a final judgement tho . The blond wood decor is very soothing the premium sake is excellent and the service is great . Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy . While their kitchen food is delicious their Sushi is out of this world . Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else . Not only is the cuisine the best around the service has always been attentive and charming . Warning You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you but the food does n t quite match up . I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor . The entree was bland and small dessert was not inspired . I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu . The view is spectacular and the food is great . Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City One of my favorite places in Manhattan . Authentic Taiwanese food that s cheap ... what more could you ask for LRB Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city RRB . The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan . delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere . Kind attentive wait staff . I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi LRB on saffron risottoyum RRB . My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos . Delicious crab cakes too . Even if the food was n t this good the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax . Great neighborhood joint . This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice . Their calzones are horrific bad vomitinducing YUCK . They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone . The counter service is bad . They charge different prices all the time . They re rude at times and not very friendly . NO PIZZA for me Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet where greasy dry and tasteless are complimentary . The dosas are skimpy unattractive and drip with grease and personally I d drink popcorn topping before I d eat another one of these . The sandwiches are dry tasteless and way overpriced . Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too . Seriously this place kicks ass . The atmosphere is unheralded the service impecible and the food magnificant . Best Italian food I ever had LRB and being Italian that means alot RRB . It is nearly impossible to get a table so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner DO NOT pass it up . This is such a lovely peaceful place to eat outside . The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty . It is set far from the small street it s on and there is no traffic noise . The food is good especially their more basic dishes and the drinks are delicious . This is a great place to take outoftowners and perfect for watching the sunset . Great sushi experience . Nice value . Unique apppetizers . Try sushimi cucumber roll . Good spreads great beverage selections and bagels really tasty . THE BIG COMPLAINT NO TOASTING AVAILABLE . I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted . Murray wo n t do it . Wo n t or Ca n t is not in the service directory . But who says Murray s is anything about service . So close but not good enough . Do n t be fooled by crowds of people . The service is awful . This place is not worth the prices . Also do n t plan on asking for your favorite roll if it s not on the menu you ca n t have it . Love Pizza ... . I will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing ... their Pizza . I live in the neightborhood and am a regular . It hits the spot every time . This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising . The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC . Even the pasta is delicious here LRB a rarity in New York pizza restaurants RRB . I ve been many time and have never been disappointed . Compared to Essa Tal offers a less doughy bagel They even scoop it out nice LRB for those on a diet RRB not too much not to little . The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee A little crowded but they move that line really fast A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning Bagels are ok but be sure not to make any special requests I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere Be sure not to get anything other than bagels ... the turkey burgers are scary The worst excuse for Japanese food I ve ever encountered . The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water . The sushi was awful The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard . Furthermore the rice had no seasoning so the sushi was bland and disgusting . The fish was adequate but inexpertly sliced . It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine . Good fast service . I would highly recommend . Food is great and inexpensive . The location is perfect . Give it a try and enjoy . I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience . Jimmy is Dominican Well this place is so Ghetto its not even funny . If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least dollar bottle minimun then you ll love it here . Would NEVER go back there . Too bad Latin Quarters closed . That place was awesome sally Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice . Always busy but fast moving . Great atmoshere and worth every bit . Open late LRB well as late as I ever got there and I m a night person RRB . Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you . The food is reliable and the price is moderate . What more can you ask for For authentic Thai food look no further than Toons . Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had LRB except for my mom s of course RRB . Try the Pad Thai or sample anything on the appetizer menu ... they re all delicious . Everything about this restaurant was special . The service was attentive yet discreet . The flavors robust and subtle . The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal . I m saving up for my next visit . I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date . The place was quiet and delightful . Service was good and food is wonderful . I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad LRB they are all good RRB . It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat . As a retired hipster I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laidback late night in the city . The wait staff is pleasant fun and for the most part gorgeous LRB in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way not in that she swaycuterthanmethatb@#$* way RRB . The food is yummy especially their cookedtoperfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries . But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere delightfully free of the BTs . You can get a completely delish martini in a glass LRB that s about drinks RRB for $ LRB I recommend the Vanilla Shanty mmmm ... RRB in a great homey setting with great music . The inhouse lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music and moreover takes requests . You ca n t go wrong with this place . Suan is a great place that I often take my friends LRB classmates RRB too . Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable makes students go back to Suan again and again . I LOVE their Thai . noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST I was in love with Pongsri on but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced . I will go back to Suan soon In summereat outside on a terrace LRB another great feature of Suan RRB I can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant . I can not imagine better Indian food in all of the city . I can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there . This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location . During the course of the past months the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better . I wish they would change back to what it was before . The food now is inconsistent . This is the kind of place you d like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret . The setting is casual and romantic . Prices are very good . The food is excellent if you re daring try the balsamic vinegar over icecream it s wonderful Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers no matter what the reviews say . They were such a ripoff LRB $ for four small meat patties in steamed buns RRB and not worth trying . The rest of the dim sum though pricey by Chinatown standards is worth it . Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table . The wait here is long for dim sum but if you do n t like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig this is a sleek LRB for Chinatown RRB alternative . A few tips skip the turnip cake roast pork buns and egg custards . These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner . LRB RRB turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard . LRB RRB egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal . After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner . I was pleasantly suprised . The food was exceptional . The menu consisted of standard brassiere food better then places like Balthazar etc. . I choose to go with one of the special the braised lamb shank in red wine which was excellent . The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual . The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal . this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices . the pad se ew chicken was delicious however the pad thai was far too oily . i would just ask for no oil next time . Have eaten at Ginger House several times and it s always good . The fried dumplings are GREAT Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service . The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat ... but planning an event especially a small intimate one forget about it . They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place but also become hostile Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end not one person takes responsibility for anything . Terrible terrible management deserves to be shutdown . Never fails to please . delicious bagels especially when right out of the oven . Spreads and toppings are great though a bit pricey . Service is fast and friendly . Only drawback they wo n t toast your bagel and they do n t make eggs for the bagel . But that is highly forgivable . Been there done that and New York it s not that big a deal . The food is decent at best and the ambience well it s a matter of opinion some may consider it to be a sweet thing I thought it was just annoying . If celebrities make you sweat then your in for a ride but if your like most around these parts then you ll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype . Rao is a good restaurant but it s nothing special . I ve eaten at many different Indian restaurants . But after last night Spice Grill is the only place I m eating indian cuisine . You must try the shrimp appetizers . Even my Indian friend could n t believe how good and tasty everything was . This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time . Great food great prices great service . If you are looking for a good quality cheap eats this is the place . it s a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food . I really loved the different and inovated touch that s the cheff gives to the food . also it s great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place the service it s just perfect ... they re so frendly that we never want to live the place I love Essabagel but I live on the west side so I often go to Murray s for convenience . Their bagels are fine but they are a little overcooked and not really a ` special bagel experience . Better than the bagel shop on the corner but not worth going out of your way for in my opinion . Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place . Great bagels made the oldfashioned way . The appetizing is excellent just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price LRB if bought by the pound RRB . Drawbacks service is slow and they do n t toast The food was absolutely amazing The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we ve ever had The lamb was tender so full of flavor the dessert was divine The waiter was attentive . The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening . Downtown Dinner Prixe fix Appetizers were ok waiter gave me poor suggestion ... try the potato stuff kanish best one . Small servings for main entree i had salmon LRB wasnt impressed RRB girlfriend had chicken it was good . Dessert is a joke ... dont bother . Volare virgins or weekly regulars everyone gets treated the same and you ca n t ask for more than that when the service is this friendly . The restaurant has a Family feel not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have singlehandedly solved third world famine . The antipasta was excellent especially the calamari as were the filling pasta mains . The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal . Still any quibbles about the bill were offset by the pouryourown measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ... . Fantastic place . Cute and decorative . A pleasant surprise . Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else . Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat . Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously but it should n t . Great food great decor great service . I recommend it Just ignore the trendy wannabes . This is the perfect spot for meeting friends having lunch dinner pretheatre or aftertheatre drinks LRB Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer Guaranteed to be a tasty experience RRB Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with coworkers or friends that you have n t seen in a while . I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends Go there once and oh yes ... you will go back ... you will ... . What a great place Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant . A cool bar with great food and tons of excellent beer . And even with it s Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too Loved it Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens this is among the best . The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful . It is expensive but well worth the money . If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n t seem to find a great Italian restaurant drive to Corona . The only thing more wonderful than the food LRB which is exceptional RRB is the service . The only thing the waiters do n t do for you is wipe your chin when you leave . Wonderful at holiday time . Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around tables at most . Service was very prompt but slightly rushed . Food was very good but not what I would consider out of this world . Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience . My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian . Too bad the food was n t of the same heritage . The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless so was the seafood tagliatelle . A real dissapointment . But that was n t the icing on the cake a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had . They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chipsgood but a far cry from what the name implies . Priced at upper intermediate range . I really liked this place . Everything I had was good and I m a eater . It was pretty inexpensive too . This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city . I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee LRB rice porridge RRB . It s great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend . It s definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone . However if you want great food at a great price and do n t mind the decor you ca n t beat this place . Quick and friendly service . This is one of the best comfort food places in the city . It s somewhere you can eat and be happy . When I m feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office I head for Cafe St. Bart s . When you re sitting in their main dining room LRB which has a spectacular handpainted high ceiling RRB you d never know there was a world outside . The food is wonderful tasty and filling and the service is professional and friendly . I ca n t wait for summer when they serve outside on their gigantic patio . Ahhh ... . I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great . This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money . The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals . I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood . They all know you . Good food . Good drink . How do you rate home I have never had cheescake like this . I thought I had died and gone to heaven . Great spot whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner . Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months . The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices . Have been several times and it never dissapoints . After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant and passing by it on a daily basis we decided to try . We were less than impressed . While the ambiance and atmosphere were great the food and service could have been a lot better . We ordered the chicken casserole but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken all dark meat and on the bone . Probably would not go again ... . i ve been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine if not good . stick with the chicken beef and lamb dishes . i do n t usually order wine with indian so i ca n t comment on their wine list or their wines . instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian . service is friendly and never had a problem walking in and getting a table . i would recommend reservations on weekends though . skip dessert . Best Reuben sandwich ever A classic Do n t miss Bloom s on your next trip to Manhatten . It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York . Thanks Bloom s for a lovely trip . As a fan of Thai I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst . The food was not fresh the sauces were bland and very oily . It just was n t Thai . Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza LRB as I love La Pizza Fresca RRB . Was surprisingly disappointed . Pizza was a little soggy . Ravioli was good ... but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced . Not enough wines by the glass either . Service however was excellent ... and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot . Food was just average ... if they lowered the prices just a bit it would be a bigger draw . This place is a great bargain . Authentic Pakistani food . People are always friendly . Do n t waste money on decor . Just straight up cheap good food . Faan is sooo good . The best pad thai i ve ever had . The design and atmosphere is just as good . bottles of wine are cheap and good . What more could you want The food was actually aweful . I m not picky but it was actually gross . The mussles were the fishiest things I ve ever tasted the seabass was bland the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese the penne w / chicken had bones in it ... It was disgusting . Nice atmosphere the service was very pleasant and the desert was good . Would n t recomend it for dinner This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples . The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes . The food is amazing rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza . Best of all is the warm vibe the owner is super friendly and service is fast . If only they delivered they d make a mint go here for the drinks especially during happy hour enough said the drinks are amazing and half off till . Ask for Usha the nicest bartender in manhattan . My fav was the sassy lassi ... . This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls . I really recommend the very simple Unda LRB Egg RRB rolls . Delicate spices onions eggs and a kickass roti . Amazing Toons has recently been redone so it s now a very attractive space . The food s as good as ever . In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food this is one of the best spots . Went here last night nice decor good service but the food was surprisingly excellent . The portions are HUGE so it might be good to order three things to split LRB rather than one appetizer and entree per person RRB for two people . Among all of the new avenue restaurants this offers by far one of the best values for your money . Ca n t wait to go back . Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town Beef noodle soup is good as well . The service is good and the resturant is clean . Best Taiwanese food in NY I have been to Rao s probably times the past years and it keeps getting better . For those that go once and do n t enjoy it all I can say is that they just do n t get it . Rao s has the best service and atmosphere in NYC . Good luck getting a table . My roommate and I LOVE this place . We recently decided to try this location and to our delight they have outdoor seating perfect since I had my yorkie with me . Indoor was very cozy and cute . The portion sizes here are huge and the sushi is good . While it s not Nobu it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full . Staff is very accomodating . Excellent dumplings served amid clean chic decor . I got the $ dim sum combo every bite of which was great . But $ for each small piece Not worth it . I wo n t go back unless someone else is footing the bill . I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend . The decor is very simple but comfortable . The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach . The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that . You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert . The staff there is very attentive and down to earth . I loved it and would go again . Great Indian food and the service is incredible . The owner truly caters to all your needs . When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets and then ordered for them . Everyone was more then happy with his choices . Great food and the prices are very reasonable . Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong it actually means Great Prosperity . The food here does a great service to the name LRB Cantonese that is ... RRB . I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork . This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it . Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh a delicious and sweet tasting bread . Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices ... . Service is not what you are coming here for ... . Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that s all the service I need ... . Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach . this place ... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend . whoever the jazz duo was they were on POINT . good music great food speedy service affordable prices . even the wine by the glass was good . its a little out of the way if you do n t live in the neighborhood but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are . Consistently good Japanese Tapas . Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon which is just down the street on St. Marks and Ave. . Always good drinks and service is pretty good ; . Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too ... . A great place to meet up for some food and drinks ... . Yakitori LRB bbq meats RRB is tasty too . It s also attached to Angel s Share which is a cool more romantic bar ... . Just moved to the neighborhood and we ve been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants . If you do n t mind presliced low quality fish unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place . Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit . Was n t going to share but I feel obligated ... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing . No thanks This place which is only a few months old is perhaps Queens biggest secret Fabulous decor makes you feel like you re in a trendy Manhattan restaurant very very good food cheaplypriced generally friendly staff and if you re a Manhattanite or spend most of your time in Manhattan Rice Avenue will make you feel at home ... very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ... all on Roosevelt Avenue We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date . We were then shooed inside . One would think we d get an apology or complimentary drinks instead we got a snobby waiter would n t even take our order for minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so . We left never to return . With so many good restaurants on the UWS I do n t need overpriced food absurdly arrogant waitstaff who do n t recognize they work at a glorified diner clumsy service and management that does n t care . I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side . If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on street which is blocks away on Ave. . Great bagels spreads and a good place to hang out in . You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town . However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town . The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre . You ca n t say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown . They re are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing Queens . Baluchi s has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices . The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent . He offers subpar service and has no personality . In fact it appears he is going to go postal at any moment . Skip this location and go to the one in Soho . There is no excuse for such lousy service I have never before eaten pieces of relatively good nigiri . Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing . You can do it here . $ for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten . I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends and spent three enjoyable hours there . The restaurant was packed at first so we waited at the bar for about minutes before we were seated . Most of the servers are very attentive friendly and quite attractive . The atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd but there were a few groups of mid s / year olds also . The vibe is very relaxed and cozy service was great and the food was excellent Me and my girls will definitely go back . Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went . I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window . Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat . I ve eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times but more often I order delivery . The food is great . Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights . I heartily recommend . There is a downside if you re ordering in the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude . Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys LRB a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup RRB who always seem disappointed with their tips . Hey I think $ for a block walk ai n t bad . Love the scene first off the place has a character and nice light to it ... very fortunate location wise . The pizza was pretty good and huge . The price very reasonable . We were and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally . We got most of it back at home with us . I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n t not mention or undermine . The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery creamy which means a big task to diggest ... tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and to count penne ... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed ... lol . No really . I have eaten a lot of pizza here . La Rosa waltzes in and I think they are doing it the best . Interesting selection good wines service fine fun decor . I have been twice to this restaurant . I love it . I plan on stopping by next week as well . I found it on a cold night the perfect spot to warm up . I recieved prompt service with a smile . To me it exemplifies Soho cute artsy interesting . Definately check it out This place blew me away ... by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side . The wine list is extensive and impressive . LOVE the atmosphere felt like I was in Paris . The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert ... definitely going to be back very soon . I just read Mocaramel s review and felt compelled to respond . I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna . Over the years the host Vittorio and his crew have always treated me as family although with all the business this notsolittle gem does it amazing he s even able to remember a consistent but notsofrequent visitor . I ve also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years A new Jazz Bar the most fantastic Dining Garden the Best Thin Crust Pizzas and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for LRB these are not your average lasagnas RRB I lOVE THIS PLACE Keep up the good work guys My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night . I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here . We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu . Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon Sea Bass and Crispy Duck . We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n t that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about Love Al Di La . I recommend this place to everyone . Great food . One of my favorite places in Brooklyn . The pastas are incredible the risottos LRB particularly the sepia RRB are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing . Overpriced and not tasty . The food here was mediocre at best . It was totally overpriced fish and chips was about $ ... . There are so many other great places to go to eat and drink ... this place is not worth it ... . Tasty Dog An awesome organic dog and a conscious eco friendly establishment . One of the best hot dogs I have ever eaten . Ca n t wait to go back . The Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it . But the best pork souvlaki I ever had is the main thing . Trust me . Run do n t walk . Super YUMMY Pizza I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant . I LOOOVE their eggplant pizza as well as their pastas We had half/half pizza mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza We had fun eating in there we were there like around a.m. in the morning Will comeback for sure wish they have it here in LA. . Excellent food although the interior could use some help . The space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting without it trying to be that . I paid just about $ for a good meal though RRB . Great sake Reliable Fresh Sushi . My husband and I take out from here times a month . The sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious . Have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once . Delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week . Delivery guy sometimes get upset if you do n t tip more than . We ve found it to be better and fresher than Kiku which is comparable in price . Best ... Sushi ... Ever . This place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi . Creative consistent fresh . Excellent sashimi and the millennium roll is beyond delicious . Not cheap but very yummy . Love it . Very very nice . The place is a bit hidden away but once you get there it s all worth it . not only is the food . Loved It . My wife and I went to Water s Edge for a romantic dinner . We had a very nice time . The waiter was attentive the food was delicious and the views of the city were great . I d definitely go back again . Great place to relax and enjoy your dinner . There is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week . Place is open till late no dress code . Good food my favorite is the seafood spaghetti . Highly recommended Excellent food for great prices . My husband and I have been sold on this from the first visit . The wait staff is very courteous and accomodating . The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to minutes hour but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indochinese food . There are no negatives to speak of . the bestt my favorite place lol . i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good . its alright . im not necessarily fanatical about this place but it was a fun time for low pirces . lobster was good nothing spectacular . its just a fun place to go not a five star restaraunt . Way below average . I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked . Had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive . Would NEVER go back . I love this place . I was n t here for the pizza so I ca n t comment on that yet but what I had was very good . The service was quick and friendly . Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome . I thought the restaurant was nice and clean . I ordered the vitello alla marsala and I was pretty impressed . The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly . The potato balls were not dry at all ... in fact it was buttery . The only downside ... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time . I ll be back for sure . WORST PLACE ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN . Very immature bartender didnt know how to make specific drinks service was so slowwwww the food was not fresh or warm waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers . I would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner . awesome . the food is always fresh ... . overpriced japanese food with mediocre service . Went here on sat and was disappointed . Chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top food was luke warm . The waitress was not attentive at all . I was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have . Too many other good places to have to settle . Not because you are `` The Four Seasons ... you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner . The food was excellent as well as service however I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed . I do not think dinner in Manhattan should cost $ where I am not swept off my feet . Red Dragon Roll my favorite thing to eat of any food group hands down . Just go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll . If you do n t like it I do n t know what to tell you . The Seafood Dynamite is also otherworldly . I m not even going to bother to describe it ; it speaks for itself . Favorite Sushi in NYC . I have eaten at some of the ` best sushi joints in NYC LRB Nobu Bond Street JewelBako etc RRB and Yamato is my favorite . An unpretentious spot in Park Slope the sushi is consistently good the service is pleasant effective and unassuming . In the summer months the back garden area is really nice . The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food . The Dancing White River and Millenium rolls are musts . SO GOOD . I CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE ... RRB . Gross food Wow . I ca n t remember the last time I had such gross food in New York . My quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a threeyear old with no sense of proportion or flavor . And $ for a plate of bland guacamole Come on . Do n t get me started on the margaritas either . Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila . Really I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds this in the city of a million restaurants at least of which are way better than this one . Save your money and your time and go somewhere else . Oh and I never write reviews I just was so moved by how bad this place was I felt it was my duty to spread the word . Great Indian Food This place was reccomended to me by a friend . When I got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly . The food was good the place was clean and affordable . I noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place This is one of my favorite spot very relaxing the food is great all the times celebrated my engagement and my wedding here it was very well organized . The staff is very good . Love their drink menu . I highly recommend this beautiful place . Nice for one time special occasion . Went for Mom s birthday brunch/lunch . They honored reservation on Sunday afternoon very well . Be aware . We were offered water for the table but were not told the Voss bottles of water were $ a piece . Food was OK . Nice view of river and NYC . I come here enjoy very much with husband . Remind me of home . Great survice . MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm so delicious . A beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night . Watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that s more lemony than smoky . Oh and there s hookah . Raymond the bartender rocks Pacifico is a great place to casually hang out . The drinks are great especially when made by Raymond . The omlette for brunch is great ... . the spinach is fresh definately not frozen ... . quacamole at pacifico is yummy as are the wings with chimmichuri . A weakness is the chicken in the salads . It s just average just shredded no seasoning on it . Also I personally was n t a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole . Overall decent food at a good price with friendly people . Best Indian Restaurant in the City . Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York . Small bright and clean BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints both in Astoria and out . What really makes it shine is the food which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices and all made inhouse LRB even the gyro meat and sausages RRB and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected . All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent but the gyro is the reason to come if you do n t eat one your trip was wasted . Best restaurant in Brooklyn . The best Great food amazing service this place is a class act . The veal was incredible last night . Fresh mind blowing flavors . This place is a must visit You want to have a real hot dog in Brooklyn Skip Nathan s ... you can get that at the mall ... go to Bark . Delicious creative and fun . Got a date ... Go here Every time I have a special occasion with my boyfriend I have a hard time going anywhere else . It is so romantic . Its dark and cozy ... there is always jazz music playing when we go . Most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like ` that couple . The food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together . I ve enjoyed of the dishes we ve ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional tooauthenticforme dish LRB I m a daring eater but not THAT daring RRB . Once you try it for a special occasion beware ... you ca n t stop You ll be ther for every anniversary birthday valentines day ... . For a Fabulous Wedding My daughter s wedding reception at Water s Edge received the highest compliments from our guests . Everyone raved about the atmosphere LRB elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views RRB and the fabulous food Service was wonderful ; . everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful . Paul the maitre d was totally professional and always on top of things . Thank you everyone at Water s Edge . Ruth mother of the Bride . would NOT go back . Service ok but unfriendly filthy bathroom . The high prices you re going to pay is for the view not for the food . The bar drinks were Eh ok to say the least . The stuff tilapia was horrid ... tasted like cardboard . We thought the dessert would be better Wrong $ down the toilet ... . oh speaking of bathroom the mens bathroom was disgusting . The floor was wet the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor no soap and no hand towels left . Go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead . Good Experience . During our trip to NYC we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the Four Seasons for their pretheater menu LRB offering a modified menu for $ pp RRB . The wine list was extensive though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings . The bread we received was horrible rock hard and cold and the `` free appetizer of olives was disappointing . However our main course was wonderful . I had fish and my husband had the filet both of which exceeded our expectations . The dessert LRB we had a pear torte RRB was good but once again the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions . When we inquired about ports the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost . Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location . All in all I would return as it was a beautiful restaurant but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future . short and sweet seating is great it s romantic cozy and private . The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they re perfect for people . The service was extremely fast and attentive LRB thanks to the service button on your table RRB but I barely understood word when the waiter took our order . The food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy . over . Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals . So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food . Will probably not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once . Impressed ... . Subtle food and service . Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy . Servers are all different Greg is my favorite . Sometimes tables do n t understand his sense of humor but it s refreshing to have a server who has personality professionalism and respects the privacy of your dinner . This is the first place I ve been that a runner remembers my order ... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant . Prices are fair across the board for both food and bev . I go out to eat and like my courses servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink . Restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place . amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings this place had ALL the trimmings and i mean all . peppers onions relish chilli cheeses you NAME it . amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE Stepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had The have a great cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for Food took some time to prepare all worth waiting for . We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd . I never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending Great find in the West Village Maggot in the food I ve been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table . The menu looked great and the waiter was very nice but when the food came it was average . Nevertheless I finished my plate and that s when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom . I showed it to the manager and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts LRB but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for RRB . When the bill came nothing was comped so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine but I did n t think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it . Yes I ate the food but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach . The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine LRB which cost less than the food RRB and made it seem like a big concession . We paid and left because we did n t feel like arguing any more . I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food . For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service . A fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes Flatbush Farm is n t in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world but it s pretty good albeit with a somewhat dismal setting . Unhygienic . I do not recommend . I went there . I got hair in my food times of then Great place great value . The food is flavorful plentiful and reasonably priced . The atmosphere is relaxed and casual . It s a great place to order from or sitin . Awesome . Inexpensive unassuming great time Sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance . Try it Very pleased . Good creative rolls Yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much . They have great rolls the triple color and norwegetan rolls are awesome and filling . One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up but save room for dessert They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert as well as a great green tea tempura . The appetizers are also delicious Amazing food . Mazing interior . Great food I ve had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers . The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors . If you re into being lost when you re just five feet from your table then hey that s a good thing . Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my goto for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future . Another review here claimed the prefix was $ person including sake but it is $ per person not including sake . Indo Chinese food pretty good ... . Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food . The chicken lollipop is my favorite most of the dishes LRB I have to agree with a previous reviewer RRB are quite oily and very spicy espeically the Chilli Chicken . My mom originally introduced me to this place but even she LRB being Indian RRB feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily . Still we keep going back RRB . I was speechless by the horrible food . I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant and the food was majorly disappointing . Rather than eating the meat entree being offered I requested a vegetarian dish . Rather than preparing vegetarian dish the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables LRB minus sauce seasoning or any form or aesthetic presentation RRB . I was so stunned and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing . This place survives on reputation alone . I will NEVER return . Best In ALL of NYC . This is the MOST wonderful restaurant in all of New York City not just Brooklyn ... . for years they have put out the most tasty most delicious food and kept it that way ... . never swaying never a bad meal never bad service ... . I m telling you ... . you should travel from the Bronx to try it ... . great food great wine list great service in a great neighborhood ... . so delicious Patsy s Pizza = true love . Hands down the best pizza on the planet . My bf and I go to the walkup counter and order a pie . In about minutes the thing is gone . Need I say more great hot dogs ... . the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside . great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost great taste . Great original taste . For me dishes a little oily but overall dining experience good . Helpful service and average price per dish $ . The only thing that strikes you is the decor LRB not very pleasant RRB . great food . This place has great indian chinese food . The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal . Be prepared to wait because the place is pretty tiny . Also they do not take credit card so come with cash Even though the place is not beautiful the food speaks for itself . Best Indian Chinese in the city by far AMAZING MY FAVORITE I have been living in NYC for bit now and I have to say I love to go out and explore the scene . I came across Village Underground by accident now I go there all the time . The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced . THE SERVICE IS AMAZING i ve had different waiters and they were all nice which is a rare thing in NYC . The DJ is awesome I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back . You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they do n t make you by bottles . Which lets face it ... at times it s a good thing . In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME Highly recommended One of the best if not THE best restaurants in Park Slope LRB and NY in general RRB . Everything on the menu is great . This establishment is the real deal . Wish NY had more of these kind of places intimate superb food homey top notch all the way around certainly worth the wait . There is `` Expensivebutworthit and there is `` ExpensiveandWTF This is a twentysomething guy that does n t mind laying down $ for a fine and delicious meal for on special occassions . But $ for a dinner for two that did n t include Wine Are you freaking kidding me Look the appetizers were really good . The entree was also very good . Ca n t argue about that but they are clearly over priced . What you are paying for is the environment and the name . Yes the place is classy and beautiful but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while . $ included . Drinks glasses of Dom Perignon at $ each . Starters Kobe Beef Sashimi . Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef . Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe . A beef Consomme . Entrees Vanison steak and Bison Steak . Vanison was good but not amazing . Bison was quite excellent however . Dessert pure disaster . Just not good at all . Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all . I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself but may be it is worth it . I was wrong . The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants but trust me they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say `` I ve been to the four seasons restaurant . I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it . All in all the food was great LRB except for the dessserts RRB . The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts . If you are going for the food it will not be worth it . Yes it is good but I ve had better for cheaper . You would think they would make up for it with service sadly no . Service was just ok it is not what you d expect for $ . Terrible Waste of money ... scammers . I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience BUT not in a good way . I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience . I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time . We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different . Our visit their to say the least was an unpleasant and costly experience And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience . We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table . Although we were told minutes and it was more like minutes . We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited . The place is beautiful The hostess was very pleasant . However our $ drinks were were horrible Once we finally got a table despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed Since we were already waiting so long we felt we had no other choice but to accept it . Our experience did not ever get any better . For each course we waited over hour to minutes and were never offered a drink . We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka . After the time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner . We asked for beverages and never received them . We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order . My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin . I would not expect this for a $ dinner . By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka What we did do was waste hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka ... some of which we never received The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses To top it all off ... the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant . By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused and wasted my hard earned money . MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly I wish I COULD be refunded Do n t go with a larger group than I went here for a family birthday dinner . Five of us walked in at approximately on a Thursday evening . The hostess said `` Wow that s a large group unless you are n t together to which I replied `` no we are and there will be one more so a table for six please . At first we were a little taken aback as this seemed to present a problem although the restaurant looked fairly empty but they hastily put the table together for us . The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions . There was no tap beer that evening which was a disappointment . Not much of a selection of bottled beer either we went with Brahma . The appetizers we ordered were served quickly an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion LRB maybe of each RRB . The lobster knuckles LRB special of the day RRB were ok but pretty tasteless . I believe there were shrimp in the `` salt encrusted shrimp appetizer . After we ate our appetizers LRB which took all of minutes RRB we ordered another round of Brahma s and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member . The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order . We replied that we would like to wait more minutes if that was okay . She replied `` well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now since you are a larger party and it might get crowded . We called the other person who was very close by and she told us to order for her so we did . The food arrived in about minutes . I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass ... which was very good . Everyone seemed generally happy with their food except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice I heard the lobster roll was excellent . They seemed to continue to rush us along taking plates without asking if we were done LRB my sister still had her fork in hand RRB . All in all the food was good a little on the expensive side but fresh . Service not the friendliest to our `` large party Probably would not go back here . Great Indian food . I lived on st and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out . Food was amazing I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly but I can say this is one of the best I ve had . Very `` normal Indian food but done really well . I have it a instead of because of the price LRB just chicken tikka masala no bread of rice is $ RRB which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does n t have an upscale feel . Also waiters try to push more food on you like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ . I do n t appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron s knowledge so that was a huge turnoff LRB more than the price RRB . But if you re prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary then this is the place to go for Indian food . One of the BEST . Bukhara Grill the tagline says it all ... `` INDIAN SPICE RAVE . My GF and I dine at Bukhara often as she lives near it . The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it . We go often for lunch and the place is packed . We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given . Bukhara is on my top Indian places in NYC . Wretched and retching . This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life . They have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant . I have never been so disgusted by both food an service . For starters they delivered us someone else s order . Fine I wont hang you for that . However once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair LRB sometimes you have to settle when it s your only option RRB I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting slimy clearly bad piece of fish skin . Not one to jump to complaints LRB hence my lack of previous online reviewing RRB I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations . My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation . None was made so i hung up . Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet . My girlfriend being slightly more aggressive and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant . Not only have I worked in restaurants for many years I am now in culinary school I am a huge lover of oysters and fish and my girlfriend is half Korean We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish . It was n t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand but now it s simply repulsive . Eat at your own risk . Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner . I took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night . I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot . The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date . More Williamsburg Garbage . My wife and I visited Dokebi tonight . We ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgibokum . The dishes came out around minutes apart . The bibimbap was average but the stone bowl was n t even close to sizzling . Too bad I had paid an extra $ for the stone bowl . The nakgibokum was horrible . Easily the worst stirfried squid I ve ever tasted . The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean . The side dishes were passable and I did get a refill upon request . The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service . I mentioned the squid dish was n t very good when the waitress visited . She just nodded and walked off . There were no communications issues either as she spoke perfect English . As to my comment about the food no apology or acknowledgment was made . My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish . We were charged full price . If you ware looking for Korean fusion I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village . Authentic Korean food lovers should visit Street of course . Lives up to the hype . We ve lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there . We ve tried before but it always packed and does n t take reservations . It was well worth the wait . The wife had the risotto which was amazing . It does n t look appetizing as it s covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black but the taste was phenomenal . The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty . i love margherita pizza i looove east village pizza . Love this place every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go . A quintessential slice of NYC pizza . The crust has a great bite and a good chew the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it the salt from the cheese is great really heightens the flavor of all the other components . Personally I like the margherita pizza better but they are all good . Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City . This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie LRB that do n t serve sushi RRB and in my opinion one of the most romantic restaurants in the city Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot once you enter the unmarked wooden doors the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you re no longer in the city . If you re planning to come here make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching LRB choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky RRB It s just you and your date and an occasional cute ` excuse me before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth My party had the BBE $ fixe prix menu which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it . We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche . Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce . I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better . The entrees were served with miso soup and rice . The sake s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world . For desserts we tried the frozen black sesame mousse LRB interesting but not extraordinary RRB and matcha LRB powdered green tea RRB and blueberry cheesecake which was phenomenal . Maybe it was the great company LRB I had friends visiting from Philly yes it was not a date this time RRB or the super reasonable price point but I just ca n t say enough good things about this brasserie . I do n t usually visit the same establishment more than once what more twice but I ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet unhurried and memorable dinner . Terrible would be a compliment The service leaves much to be desired from feeling like you are rushed the place your order to being ignored the rest of the night . We were people celebrtating a birthday we sat in the tent . We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing We never ate because by close to in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating . They are extremely rude not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ for some drinks adn their pita bread Stay away . Great Shabu Shabu . I go here at least once every other week particularly when it s cold I love it . To be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu . I tried a couple other dishes but was n t too impressed . But for the Shabu Shabu you wo n t find much better in NY . In fact there is only one I ve tried that even compares LRB shabu Tatsu RRB and even then I prefer Dokebi . The meat is fresh the sauces are great you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too . Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right onetwo punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos . The hot dogs are good yes but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich perfect on its supermarket squishy bun . Restaurant with a view . Celebrated my fathers birthday here . The food tasted very good . The family seafood entree was very good . The main entree was also very good . We order a bit of everything on the menu . Price is high but the food is good so I would come back again . This place does n t make any sense . Just want to warn you all do n t waste your time and money . This place has totally weird decor stairs going up with mirrored walls I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ... . This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird . The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n t work . The food they serve is not comforting not appetizing and uncooked . Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake . Good Food . I went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary . The food was great and tasty but the sitting space was too small I do n t like being cramp in a corner . Over all it was a very nice romantic place . I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation LRB if possible RRB . Loved it . A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it . The atmosphere was great . The food we ordered was excellent although I would n t say the margaritas were anything to write home about . Our waitress was n t mean but not especially warm or attentive either . I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year though . Maybe it has improved since then Regardless we ll be back and ca n t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio . Dumbfoundingly Poor . This was from start to finish a mindbogglingly uncomfortable experience . Lexicographers take note a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn . The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention . Polite acknowledgement is out ; . supercilious scorn is in . And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent A different server enhanced the fun dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer LRB which was delicious RRB . Overall the food quality was pretty good though I hear the salmon is much better when it has n t sat cooling in front of the guest . The place has a nice fitout some attractive furnishings and from what I could tell a reasonable wine list LRB I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins RRB . At $ for two people however this in no way represents value unless you re looking to pay by the hour for passiveaggressive torture . On that scale it s a worldbeater . How is this palce still open I honestly do n t even know where to begin . My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms . We arrived and were seated immediately which made us both happy . We ordered our appetizers I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon . Everything was going good until we got our meals . I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled . It was served with skin over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes . My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead while he deskinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat . I took one bite from the $ salmon and I have never in the years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy as dry and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms . At this point the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n t say anything and guess what the waitress WALKED away . So I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it . I could n t even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . I ve had better chicken at BBQs So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible . Guess what I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did she says `` oh well I wish you would have said something earlier No apology nothing . After that she simply took our plates walked away came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it No desert menu no apology nothing I was literally going to explode but instead my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager . This is where it really really gets bad the manager said there is absolutely nothing we can do it s a matter of taste that she did n t like it and I can not comp it . Again no apology no is there anything else I can get you no can I get you a drink to make up for it nothing We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore . The level of rudeness was preposterous . The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want so we paid for what we did enjoy the drinks and appetizers and walked out . I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE . THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED . cirspy crust margherita pizza . we have been there times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes . it was really good pizza . the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded RRB RRB RRB . you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review . Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan . I ll being with a couple of positives cool decor good pita and hummus and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty . Moving on . If I could give stars I would do so for this place . Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian . The reason there are different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews . Well ... they can run but they ca n t hide . I live in the West Village and I ve been to a lot of restaurants . Sometimes you pay a lot and do n t get much in return it s manhattan things are expensive . However most of them are at least prompt and pleasant . This place ... god where do i begin . It is quite a spectacular scene i ll give them that . The decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n t notice that you just payed bucks for some cold eggplant that took FRICKIN HOURS TO COME How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy or any other for that matter is beyond me . Great Hot Dogs I ve made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby LRB I live on UWS RRB . Though it s been crowded most times I ve gone here Bark always delivers on their food . The hot dogs are top notch and they re Slamwich is amazing Going to Bark is always worth the train ride and will make your tongue and belly very happy Only complaint is the pricing I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu . But nonetheless great spot great food . Fabulous food if the front of house staff do n t put you off . We live nearby BFC . It s a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions but we ve eaten there times in the last years . Each time we ve been the front of house staff LRB not the waiters they re fantastic but the people who greet and seat you RRB has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return . As BFC does n t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated which can be over an hour later The frizzy retro girl LRB with winged / Dame Edna glasses RRB will yell at you if you try to order a drink . I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at on a Friday night because she `` had a BBQ to go to that night WTF I d be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely There s another girl who I ca n t describe she is about with brown hair who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in except she only hears the last part of what you said so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you re * really * talking about . I m a friendly person so I would n t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal . Again I d be super upset if that were my employee . Considering you will spend at least $ a head I expect better service . So if you re walking by and thinking about dining you might want to see who s going to be seating you first ... . MaitreD `` Eat and get out . My family ate here last weekend . The food and service were fine however the maitreD was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant . While finishing our meals which included a highend bottle of wine our son s fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert . This guy refused to seat her and she left followed shortly by the four of us but not before I told him that in my years of world travel including Paris that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant . His response was smug arrogant and condescending totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening . A word to the wise you ca n t dine here and disturb the maitreD s sense of table turnover as whacked as it is or else . If you go here do it on his offnight . Best meal in a long time Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening . I had the Lamb special which was perfect . My father had the flank steak which was very good and my mother had the swordfish . The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience . The food is great and the environment is even better . Everyone must come here at least once . Highly recommend it Taking Hot Dogs to the next level . At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint but at Bark you do n t just get your average hot dog . Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available . Great Atmosphere . Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal . I highly recommend the fish tacos everything else was ok . Cool atmosphere the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night . Poor service and management . Do n t go to this place Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner . Appetizers took nearly an hour . When the main course finally arrived LRB another RRB half of our order was missing . Never got an explanation as to what was going on . The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly . When we threatened to leave we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing . On the way out we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues . Ca n t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients . What a hassle The food is very good but not outstanding . There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table . On our last visit they skipped over our name on the list leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table . Mistakes happen but they are usually accompanied by an apology perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff . Without the wait or attitude I would probably go back but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and do n t make me jump through hoops . Expensive . I went there after hearing how great it was . Wow . The bread was stale the salad was overpriced and empty . The pasta was well cooked did n t have enough sauce though or flavor . I though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far . So rude I went with JWILS . Her review is above . I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience . My friend is right in the experience we had . The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us . The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared . I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane . I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said `` can I help you and `` how many are in your party . What The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were . We did n t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem . Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and nonexistent customer service . bad staff . I generally like this place . The food is good . The design of the space is good . But the service is HORRID I was there for brunch recently and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter . The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand . I ca n t believe that it was but please put the bag down before delivering food The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating LRB a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere so I try to ignore it RRB . I could n t ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends who was in mid bite to clear the table . She then put the check down without asking if we were done and came to check on the bill every two minutes even though we were one of three occupied tables . I wish I could like this place more and I wish someone would retrain the staff . Yum Serves really good sushi . Not the biggest portions but adequate . Green Tea creme brulee is a must Do n t leave the restaurant without it . No Comparison . I ca n t say enough about this place . It has great sushi and even better service . The entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need . I ve been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date . Snotty Attitude . We were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast . The owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint . Good food We love breakfast food . This is a great place to get a delicious meal . We never had to wait more than minutes . The staff is pretty friendly . The onion rings are great They are not greasy or anything . Overrated . I was highly disappointed in the food at Pagoda . The lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns the few they actually give you ... were not good . The prices are outrageous especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood Chinese establishments . Nice ambience but highly overrated place . I will not go back . Worst Service I Ever Had . A group of of us went there for Sunday brunch and sat outside . Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received . Our waiter was nonexistent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered we were not given any water or utensils . I complained to the manager but he was not even apologetic . I will never return again . Fabulous Italian Food I highly recommend Mioposto . I am so happy to have a wonderful Italian restaurant in my neighborhood . The wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to Italy . I love this restaurant . I will never forget the amazing meal service and ambiance I experience at this restaurant . It was absolutely amazing . The wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice good at their jobs and cultured . I have not a bad thing to say about this place . AMAZING . I can not wait to go back again this coming weekend Mmm ... good Went there last night with a friend . She had heard from a coworker about this place . The food was great It s * very * reasonably priced esp for the quality of the food . I had the Kafta plate and it was perfect . We re going back D . Finally a meal that you will remember for a long time In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants its nice to see a place that bucks that trend and just plain delivers high quality food and good service period . This is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer . Caution its real food for people who love the best . Some of the food is clearly oriented toward foodies LRB like me RRB so if your not a foodie LRB nothing wrong with that RRB head over to McDonalds or some Ruby Tuesday and have at it If your looking for real quality LRB not the BS that is seen on yelp ratings which allegedly recently got in trouble for `` adjusting ratings RRB you need to get in here Very Disappointing . I took my parents here for their anniversaryvery very disappointed I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price . I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it . Rice is too dry tuna was n t so fresh either . Nothing really came across as outstanding . Very disappointed . I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent . However the value and service are both severely lacking . Portions contain less fish than one would expect particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in NYC LRB Masa excluded of course RRB . Furthermore while the fish is unquestionably fresh rolls tend to be inexplicably bland . The service ranges from mediocre to offensive . On a recent trip our waiter was extremely dismissive while no less than three staff members waited handandfoot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby . We were then charged for their most expensive sake LRB $ per serving RRB when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price . But Im sure this was just an honest mistake ... . Freshest sushi I love this restaurant . They pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls . The sashimi was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted . Their apps are all delicious . The only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side . But the space is small and lovely and the service is helpful . You are bound to have a very charming time . Not recommanded The food was not great & the waiters were rude . It is not worth going at all and spend your money there great service . Pretty cheap for sit down Mexican AND downtown . my service was stellar the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me . food was fine with a some littletastierthannormal salsa . If you re in the area you should n t be disappointed . Ok ... Maybe I went in on someone s bad day ... . the food was great the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me . Took forever to get our order taken water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention . I do n t know if I ll be back ... . Mama Mia I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place . the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it s edible even when you order ahead . BUt once done it s not too much dough not too much cheese not too much sauce . Best Sushi in town . Have gone to all the top places . Everything you want and more very fresh . Its worth the wait especially since they ll give you a call when the table is ready . The best calamari in Seattle ... and the best summertime deck experience they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather . A perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year . Endless fun awesome music great staff By far the best bar in the east village ... . I went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast Every time `` is called the bartender buys everyone drinks Been there lots since and its always a good time . Great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks . Definitely has one of the best jukebox s i ve seen in a long long time . I FOUND A NEW HOME ON SECOND AVENUE Where can I begin . I ca n t Just go there and see for yourself . The food is great the bartenders go that extra mile . You need to watch your game they will have it on for you . The owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for . And the upstairs is a great place to hang out . Not alot of smoking places left in New York but I have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city . Kudos to these guys . I found a new home and just moved with a long lease . Thank you . Go Beyond the California Rolls ... . The sushi here is delicious They have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from ; Atlantic or Pacific . I ve had the Jellyfish Horse Mackerel Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others and they were all good . My only negative comment is that I wish the pieces were a little bigger . The decor is rustic traditional Japanese . The crowd is mixed yuppies young and old . The service was courteous and attentive . Mediocre food . We ate on the outside patio area for dinner on a Saturday night . The outside patio area has an abbreviated menu . We ordered the marinated grapes buffalo style chicken wings and the turkey sandwich . My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price . We are locals and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably onetime customer tourists . Service was decent . Drinks were good . Unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks I would n t recommend going here . You are likely to be disappointed . Excellent food nice ambience fairly expensive . I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi LRB big ones to a plate instead of or so little gnocchis RRB and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes . The ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney . It was romantic and even nice even with my sister reminded me of Italy and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa . I recommend it for a night when you want to splurge LRB it was a bit expensive RRB Best Indian food in L.A. . I ve been to over a dozen Indian places in L.A. and this is still my favorite . The best thing is the prices are also quite reasonable . The chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes . The chana masala LRB garbanzo beans RRB are also excellent . It s located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center not the greatest location but the food keeps me coming back for more . hidden little jem . tucked away over by the Beverly Center . Never too crowded and always great service . I think I have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent . I can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma . You routinely see Indian families and friends dining there which is always a good sign . I appreciate their delivery too . Nice food but no spice I really enjoyed my meal here . I had yummy lamb korma saag paneer samosas naan etc. . The food was all good but it was way too mild . Normally places ask how hot you want it but they did n t . I should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild . I will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches . The naan was some of the best I ve had and I really enjoyed the bhartha not too tomatoey . Even the chickpeas which I normally find too dry were good . And they packaged everything nicely so it did n t spill . awesome find . I do n t understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long ... the fajita salad the colorado the fajitas EVERYTHING is delicious . I love the warm & cosy environment . I just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party ca n t wait to celebrate my next birthday there . best restaurant in the world great decor great customer service friendly manager . first of all henrymillionare you dont know a thing about middle eastern food so dont talk . Cry me a river stop complaining you obviously you have no taste in food . i am never disappointed with there food . the atmosphere is great . and all you other people that have a problem get some help . great lunch spot . Great financial district mexican spot . Always busy but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service . Everything I ve had here is good taco salads burritos enchiladas i love this place . Also have great margaritas You can order to go if you have to get back to the office too Lebanese Food Yum I ve been to Open Sesame only once but I m still reeling from the experience The food is simply unforgettable I had the beef kabobs with a side of cucumber yogurt . The presentation of the food was an added bonus it looked just as great as it tasted My best friend had the chicken shawarma and she STILL raves about it being the best anywhere Her sister had the baklava for dessert What a tastly flaky treat The staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful . GO TO OPEN SESAME Holy Hummus The food is here is incredible though the quality is inconsistent during lunch . Dinners have always been excellent in terms of food quality . The open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given . The side of potatoes is to die for as is the labne LRB yogurt dip RRB . Also they serve THE best hummus in America with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil LRB which I believe is the traditional way RRB The only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service . There have been several occasions when we ve just not gotten some side dishes we ve ordered . However this place is a gem and I wo n t stop going back . great beer . My first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible We waited over minutes for our drinks and over hours for our food . I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal . HOWEVER one Sunday afternoon my husband and I did go LRB although with my loud protests RRB and were pleasantly surprised . The band was very good and the service was attentive . Outside in the area between the restaurant and the park children were running around while their parents sipped wine . We ordered a selection of the small plates and the shoe string onions goat cheese pizza grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good . It was like dining at a completely different restaurant . We have since returned and also had a great experience sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer LRB cold and good RRB . We did have the same waiter the second time so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good . Sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun . Seattle s BEST Winelist . Ray s LRB suprisingly RRB has the city s BEST & most diverse wine list . The sommelier is fantastic downtoearth & extremely knowlegable . I would go back for the wine experience alone . Nice job NOT THE PLACE IT ONCE WAS . It is sad to see a place that was once `` THE place to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch now be the place that is a big `` DONT BOTHER . The food is not what it once was LRB potions have seriously seen downsizing RRB prices have gone up and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere LRB including mainland Europe RRB . What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment . This establishment really made a marked decline after LRB and this is recurring story RRB the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS `` DINERS DRIVEINS AND DIVES hosted by Guy Fieri in which Schooner or Later was subject of . Perhaps now Scooner or Later falls into the `` Dive category . This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat . I hope one day Scooner or Later returns to what it once was . Untill this happens my advice is to STAY AWAY . Open & Cool Place with the Best Pizza and Coffee . Mioposto has a very creative & delicious pizza menu . The coffe is very good too . Great open and friendly ambience . This place is charming and relaxing . The servers behind the counter are always friendly and helpful . It reminds me of those great little restaurants in San Francisco . It s a great place to enjoy food and meet friends . Old Reliable . After years in Seattle Ray s rates as the place we always go back to . Great food spectacular location and friendly service keep us coming back year after year . Enjoyed the food . First of all I am not from Long Beach . I was visiting SoCal a couple of months ago when the friend I was visiting decided to take me to this restaurant . LRB She was actually going to take me to another mediterranean restaurant right across the street but they were not open yet even though it was a few minutes past their opening time . RRB I liked it . Food was good and cheap . I had the kafta plate and I enjoyed it . It was so much though that I could barely finish but I did since it was delicious . Atmosphere was nice . Service was kind of slow our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it was n t that busy . Still I would recommend this place . BTW I really like Long Beach . It was one of the few places in SoCal where you would actually walk around and not have to take a car . WOW IT CANT GET ANY BETTER WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY NICE PEOPLE AMAZING FOOD WOW . Great food with an awesome atmosphere Eggs pancakes potatoes fresh fruit and yogurt everything they serve is delicious . The best place for a leisure Sunday breakfast amidst yachts then take a stroll through the nearby Farmer s Market . great meal the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi this fish was perfect plus i am allergic to rice and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating did n t even bat an eye and the waiter suggested a perfect sake absolutely fabulous Unbeatable sushi Two thumbs up I love sushi and I have eaten it all over the world . This is right up there with places in Tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned . Melt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi and very tasty rolls too . Be sure to try the oyster roll . splendid . How to describe the best sushi in NYC hmmmm delicious amazing fantastic suculent perfect nah all of the above . I ca n t saybenough good things about this restaurant and I ca n t wait for my next several visits . The best Chuwam Mushi I have ever had . Perfect on a cold day . $ with tip . Perfection . Good Sushi High Price . One of the best Sushi place in town . The house special roll is really good . On weekends you might have to wait for couple hours . However they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone . A cozy spot for . I ca n t believe Murphy s has been around for over years amazing . That s a huge compliment especially in the fickled restaurant business ... enough already Brunch at Murphy s is to die for my specialty ... egg white omelet the food is always freshly prepared . It s the perfect spot for a romantic date for or a secret rendezvous Save room for scrumptious desserts . The restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you wo n t forget I guarantee you wo n t be disappointed there s also valet parking . Addicting Best Mexican place for lunch in the financial district . Love the enchiladas and chicken soup and be sure to check out their specials . The cooks have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes . Can get busy on Fridays for a table but once seated the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly . I went there with a friend from out of town ... and we were both very impressed Went on a Monday night so there was no wait for a table . The sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick . The price was right too . The atmosphere was just okay . Space was limited but the food made up for it . I d go back there in a heartbeat . Should have gone to Trader Joe s and had frozen pizza LRB . My family went on a midweek evening to have dinner . The restaurant was full and there was a sign posted `` wait to be seated . Well I guess it s hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff . We stood there for minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us . Finally my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked `` Are you waiting for a table Once seated it took about minutes to finally get the meal . The prior reviews said Kid friendly ... give me a break with two young children that is light years . The Caesar salad I ordered had so much lemon I could n t eat it . The pizza was slightly reminescent of Baker s Beach pizza which occupied the the space years ago LRB a distant second RRB . It was decent but nothing exceptional . This establishment is consistent with my feelings of the rest of Chow Foods group . We used to frequent most of their restaurants but over the years each one has really been disapointing . I m a born and bred Southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening . Well I guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management to pay a visit to Tutta Bella in Columbia City for some tips . Great food better Margaritas This is one of my top lunch spots huge portions fast service and amazing margaritas it gets really busy so get there on the early side so you can grab a seat if you do have to wait its not bad because the service is quick Check out the art on the walls very colorful i love this place i have been eating at this place for over years now and i have never had one bad meal . i highly recommend this place to all that want to try indain food for the first time . The lunch menu is an awesome deal plenty of food trust me . Fresh ingrediants and super tasty . The place is the next best thing to my Moms cooking . Best food phenominal service . For the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best NYC has to offer the fish is the freshest and the service is superb . Not only can the selection be innovative but there s a nice balance of traditional sushi as well . The nicest waiters in town . WAY OVERRATED This place is unbelievably overrated . If I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average brunch food then I would put Murphy s at the top of the list . The regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive . Your a sushi fan you love expertly cut fish great sake a killer SOHO location and of course Salmon Tuna Fluke Yellow Tail Cod Mackeral Jellyfish Sea Urchin Shrimp Lobster Sea Bream Trout Milk Fish Blue Fin Tuna Eel Crab Sardine Monk Fish Roe Scallop Oysters and a varity of Toro . There is only one place on the east coast that has it all plus a lot more . Better than nobu tomoe taka yama sugiyama and the rest . Bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world BLUE RIBBON SUSHI . Believe it baby Cut to the chase this is amazing It s unpretentious and underground . It s fresh welcoming delicious and relaxing . Hands down the best tuna I have ever had . Blue Ribbon lives up to it s fantastic reputation . I went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again . What a find Well worth it . Great value sushi with high quality & nice setting . Good for late night dining LRB last minute planning RRB without reservations . Try the Chef s Choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty . Poor customer service / poor pizza . As with most restaurants in Seattle Mioposto s service was bad and the food was overpriced . I know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places but Mioposto s pizza lacks quality and good taste . To be honest I ve had better frozen pizza . I m not kidding . The only positive thing about Mioposto is the nice location . Love it every time . I was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews this place is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way and we ve eaten here more than times . People complain about the dim lighting but that is one what I love about this place if you want to stare at your food in bright light go to McDonalds . The food is fantastic and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we ve been there . The only problem would be the wait but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting . Never had one single problem there . Seafood Plus . This was great dining experience . If you re going to see Danny Gans or just staying at the Mirage do n t miss this one . The appetizer of oysters lobster crab LRB small size RRB made a perfect entre for my wife . Seabass on lobster risotto was the best . Caesar salad was superb . Great bottle of wine . Leave room for dessert . COMPLETELY OVER RATED I will have to do more research before checking out new places based on Diners driveins and dives reviews . I noice most reviews mention the bad service . The food was ok but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served . Even then the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items . We had a very hard time getting the waitress attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager . As it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token discount on our bill . When the bill came he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks . It was clear he did n t really care . With so many great breakfast/lunch places in So Cal this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit . AVOID THE PLACE . Save yourself the waste of time & DO NOT visit . I made my trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online . When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible I waited for minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again . After sitting there with my empty glass for over minutes I left . I went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that does n t work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link . I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago . After telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar . After sitting at the bar for over minutes the bar keep had made only drinks & kept telling us she d be right with us . We left without ever getting service . As of writing this I just tried their give away a link again & it still does n t work . There are so many better places to visit Best Crab Cakes in Town . Thats a big statement considering I ve been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since I was about seven but something about these little devils gets better every time . If you can come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening . Great seasonal fish and seafood with a classy waterfront setting . Always a winner . Great Pizza Poor Service . Love their pizza especially the mushroom pizza . Also love their caeser salad . Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I do n t like the servers one young woman in particular . She does n t make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance . But she is very friendly with certain people making it even more annoying . Management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners . Many people talk about the great pizza and poor service so it ca n t just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers . It s a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n t so impersonal and corporatelike . Great Breakfast . This place is famous for their breakfast . They have been featured on the food network and they deserve it . The food is great and they make a mean bloody mary . I love breakfast here . Their crab eggs benedict is addicting . All their menu items are a hit and they serve mimosas . Does n t get any better than that . best chinese food i have tasted in a long time . we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night . there was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area . You can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing . the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning . not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up . the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese . we ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food . First off the food came fast and all together RRB i like that ... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other . so about the prawns they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty . yummy . best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted . next one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli . the brocollis were so fresh and tasty . i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time every piece was as eventful as the first one ... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked . not chewy at all . for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee ... oh la la yummy melt in your mouth . we are for sure coming back to this restaurant . every month if possible . it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel ... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss esp if your in downtown san jose . Chintzy portions . The sushi here is perfectly good but for $ a piece either the slices of fish should be larger or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant LRB even for NYC RRB . We easily spent more than $ per person LRB not including alcohol RRB and were still hungry . I m astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ . Terrible service food ok pricey . This past weekend had great weather for San Francisco standards . So for the ` after beach excursion we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to Park Chalet . The restaurant was busy however there were a few tables open . We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it d be a minute wait . So here we are my wife year old daughter and I trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building LRB where the murals and artifacts are RRB . minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off . We went back to the restaurant and low and behold we were seated at one of the tables that was available minutes ago Logic behind that None that I can think of . We put in our order and although we ordered appetizers the food did n t arrive until minutes later ... WITH OUR MAIN COURSE . Um so now what are appetizers for Oh I forgot to mention that they do n t have bread service . Its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag . My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water LRB she had a sore throat RRB and I guess that since it was only water it was n t a priority for them to actually bring it . In other words if they are n t making $ $ off of you then you do n t rate high on their ` service scale . Food wise its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n t a fancy place . The upside of the restaurant If I needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or Golden Gate park . Its great if you spent the day there and did n t want to drive to eat . Parking is reasonably good they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby . Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides . I d hate for tourists to go to Park Chalet and think that this is how all San Francisco restaurants are like . Always good . A sushifiend friend recently visited and our group of three just had to come for dinner . on a Sat before a Broadway play and we were quickly seated and served . Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi LRB that eel with avodcao um um um RRB . As usual the omikase did n t disappoint in freshness although it scored low on creativity and selection . Their specialty rolls are impressive though I ca n t remember what we had . Great selection of sakes . Green tea creme brulee gets better each time I have it . It is n t the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time . Very poor customer service . Schooner or Later s charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not unfortunately compensate for its very poor customer service . While this diner had reasonably good food the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service . As part of a small party of four our food was dropped off without comment ; . any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table . When we finally were able to flag someone down it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food who was also not the same person who had taken our order . After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant . A brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment to say we had been `` blown off would be an understatement . The manager continually interrupted with `` Is there anything else I can do for you a strange comment because she had hardly listened let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience . She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage but we could hardly take her promise seriously seeing as she had n t bothered to get the waitresses name . In short Schooner or Later could n t have cared less about our being at their establishment . Next time we will go somewhere else or try other restaurants close by like Mimi s Cafe and Claim Jumper . o clock in the morning . you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi ... then this might be the place . the fish was fresh though it was cut very thin . great service . good sake selection . Dungeness crabs here Ray s is THE place to go for high quality seafood dinners . And they give good quantity for the price . We were only in Seattle for one night and I m so glad we picked Rays for dinner I love Dungeness crabs and at Ray s you can get them served in about different ways We shared the family platter and I especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu . I ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting ... yummy And the service was simply spendid quite a delight . Great Breakfast . Great drinks corn beef hash coffee B Fast burritos Gluten Free menu . The service is fantastic at this fun place . If there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a place is open you know it is great . This is the case at this gem . Best Neighborhood Standby . You Ca n t Go Wrong Here . Every neighborhood has a few great local bars that are the best secrets . In Grammercy/Union Square/East Village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot . The music is great no night better or worse the bar tenders are generous with the pouring and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits . Seriously you ca n t go wrong if it is unpretentious local fun you seek . Oh and the cheese fries are awesome Good Food Great Service Average Prices LRB For the Strip RRB . I decided to eat at Stack because of their price fixed preshow dinner . When I walked in I was taken aback by their incredible wood decor . The music playing was very hip something pop music but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat which became annoying midway through dinner . We were quickly seated and requested the special dinner which came with RRB Shellfish and Shrimp appetizer or Caesar Salad RRB oz steak LRB with a single potato chip RRB and RRB homemade donut holes . I got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright . It was n t the freshest seafood ever but the taste and presentation was OK . Before the steak came the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested I pick something from the menu . I picked the asparagus which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared . It was steamed and tossed with garlic . The oz steak came next and it tasted great at least initially . The steak was done to my exact liking LRB medium rare RRB and was nice and juicy . It s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction though both were indistinguishable in taste . Though one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak . My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ... MSG ... taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant . Finally the homemade donut holes were served for desert . They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and nottoosweet . The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner . The dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip almost $ after tax and tip LRB about average RRB . But the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly . Overall I would go back and eat at the restaurant again . Just remember to dress a little urbanchic so you don t look too far out of place . good sake good food i honestly do n t know much about japanese food at all . In the past sake usuallly just tasted kind of like salty water to me . Server made several sake suggestions which were very good . had many dishes but the BEST was the lobster ways . VERY GOOD Overpriced . We dined at the Colorado location today . Waited minutes for a table for which was ok for such a big crowd . The waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded . Also there was only one bathroom stall probably need more for such big crowds . Most importantly we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu . At best the food was good and definately overpriced . For the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower . Not sure if I would go back . My favortie pizza joint in Seattle . This is my `` must bring out of town guests to restaurant and they always enjoy and rave about it . In fact many want to return a second time during their visit . The pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic . I ve always found the wait staff and if you sit at the bar the cooks very friendly . They are n t the most talkative but everytime I ve been there they have been very busy which probably accounts for the lack of conversation . I also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant . It s just the right size for the menu . Excellent . My husband and I love eating at Mioposto Café . We re ca n t say enough about their delicious gourmet pizza s You wo n t be disappointed by their menu . The pizza s are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings . You never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there . The pizza s are light and scrumptious . Try the Pizza Ensalata It s a salad on top of pizza crust . Absolutely delicious . The pizza s are not huge and the crust is thin ... keep that in mind when you re ordering . Worth the wait . Had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning but it was so worth it . The food is sinful . The staff was really friendly . The atmosphere was great . The specialty here is decadent pancakes but I ve been back now four times and I ve been wowed every time . Nothing on the menu is less than amazing . Go with some friends wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe and enjoy more than your average breakfast . Good eats . Whose writing all the great reviews Why is it that LRB almost RRB every good review is by `` anonymous I do n t know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place . I have been to this place folks and it is BAD . Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that s halfway decent . I have been here spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment . Fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $ dollar plate and NOT ONE was eatable . DONOT GO Delicious . The atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate . The best dish are the honwy walnut prawns just outstanding . The service is really attentive and charming . Locations . they have locations . the listed and then one in Southglenn mall parking lot which is reviewed here and one in Ft Collins . We waited for an hour to be seated . The service was excellent the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding . It was worth the wait . Plan on waiting minutes . Will definitely be back . Southglenn is largest location . Delicious ... I recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful restaurant on street and wow what a great evening we had . The food is fantastic authentic delicious and very very affordable . The decor was beautiful and unique . There was a really nice vibe about the place ... good music atmosphere and happy looking people . Our server was very professional and friendly . To the owners of Open Sesame ... Bravo ... I ca n t wait to come back to dine at your restaurant Delectable . It s a tiny place so if you get there before on a weekend LRB Thurs Sun RRB you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar . Once you re inside the real experience begins . Everything and I mean everything on the menu is delectable . The waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa . The sushi is as fresh as it comes you d think ocean was in their backyard no joke If you re interested in good tasting LRB without the fish taste or smell RRB large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place ... . big thick pepperoni . The pepperoni s cut real thick Yum . The pizza itself is not exactly the best I ve had EVER but still pretty good . I probably would n t go back though ` cuz I do n t know if it s worth it . Maybe I ll go back once more many years from now when I ve forgotten I went there already . Sit in the Balcony . Not bad . Food was good and appetizing . Portions was just enough for me but may not be for a big eater . Fair menu selection . The appetizer was interesting but the Creme Brulee was very savory and delicious . Indoor ambience was modern . If it s nice outside request for a table in the balcony . It s a great place to people watch . Although the service could be improved considering the money you put in . Our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times . Should checkup on us more frequently do n t you think Late night dinning with exeptional food . I did n t want to go there because of the reviews and prices I saw on the internet . That was the last night in Vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing so we walked in the check the place . We were seated right away the table was private and nice . The service was exceptional sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters . The food was very good filet mignon was probably the best I ve ever try . The portions are big though so do not order too much . Groovy music made the dinner casual . The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places . I have a but here there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd . The bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser . There were bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink . I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom . This place rocks Mercedes restaurant is so tasty the service is undeniably awesome The chips and salsa are so yummy and the prices are fabulous . The atmosphere is aspiring and the decor is festive and amazing . The catering is out of this world and Raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world Drinks are suberb and I feel like I am in a Third World country when I walk in the door . Insultingly Overpriced . Mediocre Service/Quality . This review is for the Southglen location which is not listed in Citysearch I wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but Snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service so this review as well as the other negative ones for their Larimer location will go unaddressed . The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu . To start off approximately oz of orange juice will cost you $ . They serve it in a tall skinny hourglass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket . I should have just asked for the check when I saw that ; but their menu was so unique that I continued . The pancakes were certainly inventive but $ for pancakes LRB one of them was more like RRB in the pancake flight LRB sample of different pancakes RRB is well overpriced . The pancakes should be larger LRB at least RRB to justify the expense even with the unique offerings . The flavors were good but I have had far better pancakes at a German pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger . On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking and would have had to send them back again if I had n t rejected the meal all together . I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue . To their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was . In the end our check came to $ for small pancakes a breakfast burrito an orange juice and an iced tea LRB I had water RRB . This was times what the same meal would have cost at Le Peep . Snooze provided an inventive pancake offering but Le Peep would have provided better service and quality . Much more than just a great view I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray s Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations . Ray s is something of a Seattle institution but given its gorgeous Sound views I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service . Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the thirdbest thing about Ray s To start things off our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order . My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns smoked albacore tuna Ray s fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill scallops in a tasty soy dressing and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce . For my entr&eacute;e I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard artichoke hearts fennel and pecorino toscano . The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique LRB not to mention tasty RRB . My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans . I had a taste of all three items on her plate and they were superb . Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night but I did remain puzzled by one issue Who thinks that Ray s is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner ... they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table . Given that Ray s is a seafood restaurant ... well you get the idea ... . All considered I have to say that Ray s Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution . While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one . Oh yeah ... the view was good too . This computer is absolutely AMAZING plus hours of battery... super fast processor and really nice graphics card.. and plenty of storage with gb though I will upgrade this and the ram.. This computer is really fast and I m shocked as to how easy it is to get used to... I ve only had mine a day but I m already used to it... GET THIS COMPUTER FOR PORTABILITY AND FAST PROCESSING the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run. i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it. and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it. As a computer science student in college I find that the portability longevity and ease of use of this computer make me shockingly want to do homework more; without a big ol clunky machine in my backpack I feel like I can do programming homework anywhere. I highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college. A great feature is the spotlight search one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document. Oh my goodnessI am not a happy camper. My HP is very heavy. Not easy to carry. The battery has never worked well. The battery gets so HOT it is scary. Yet HP won t do anything about the problem. I returned the computer to HP and they kept it for months. When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem. So you can imagine how unhappy I am with this item. Currently if I use the laptop I can t sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs. Well they don t care a bunch. But at the same time they the company would not and could not do anything about my problem. I would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful. And if you are going to deal with HP be careful. In my house HP is a nasty word. Since I purchased my Toshiba netbook I have been very pleased with it I have a laptob and a desktop. The netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me. The screen takes some getting use to because it is smaller than the laptop. I have not have any problems. The Notebook PC Toshiba Qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me. He gave me this PC about years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it. Its still going. It is in the best condition and has a really high quality. This is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone. You will not regret buying such a great thing like this It can t get any better. Waited on getting this computer but it has been a great change. Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac. This laptop meets every expectation and Windows is great It s fast it s easy easy easy to set up easy to hook to my wireless network. It s even easy to hook up to other wireless networks. The battery doesn t last long but I m sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem. I don t use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it s perfect for me. Most everything is fine with this machine speed capacity build. The only thing I don t understand is that the resolution of the screen isn t high enough for some pages such as Yahoo Mail. I bought it for really cheap also and it s AMAZING. Recommended to people as their first laptop. Plain and simple it laptop runs great and loads fast. Easy to carry can be taken anywhere can be hooked up to printers headsets. I m already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown. Being a PC user my whole life it s taking a bit of time to adapt to the OS of a Mac but I m finding my way around. The unibody design is edgy and durable. The LED backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more. I m learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages. A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect. They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I m looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular. I m excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same. It s more expensive but well worth it in the long run. Great product very easy to use and great graphics. One drawback I wish the keys were backlit. I m glad I bought this laptop it was worth the few extra dollars. It had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted to replace my desktop machine. I wasn t really as concerned about portability it s a very large laptop but it s not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise. I m very happy with this machine I love the size keyboard the functions. I don t really have a complaint. It is easy to use good quality and good price. Perfect trifecta I would recommend this product. The salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it. This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it The DVD burner broke after burning DVD d during that time They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later. If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before I spoke to different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a person Needless to say I told them No and have a nice day and hung up I can guarantee this will be the last Dell I will ever purchase Breaking within year of purchase and speaking to people to report the damaged part will be returned late I do not recommend this company or their products So far a great product. High price tag however. Still trying to learn how to use it. it is the worst computer dell ever made. it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one. breaks easily. only good thing is the graphics quality. There are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new MacBook No Viruses This laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials. I am loyal to Apple. I am very Happy This just keeps having it s hard drive replaced Acer won t replace the laptop. the manufacturer s warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts. This thing is a lemon. This MacBook is an outstanding product with great value. Its ease of use and the top service from Apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar cannot be beat. Suffice it to say my MacBook Pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed. It does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern. I have had nothing but problems since the day I took it out of the box My first problem was with the preloaded Norton Firewall/Security program. It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived. It took Toshiba tech support calls and different techs to correct the problem. Then just the other day my left mouse button snapped Being only months old I am not a happy camper Buyer Beware. this one in my opinion might be a lemon It rarely works and when it does it s incredibly slow. I have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses times and i have not even had it for more then months *IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD LAPTOP THIS IS NOT IT Like the price and operation. Some features arent friendly volume wheel sound quality etc. But for the cost this is a winner. I absolutely love my mac I can t imagine my life without it anymore I ve haven t had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off. Apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached. I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly. I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem. I think I might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion. I bought this laptop Was the worst Laptop I ve ever bought. I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare. And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare. They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn t work. And that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed. Its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop. So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it... I saved for this laptop for months and I can tell you personally it was worth the wait. The display on this computer is the best I ve seen in a very long time the battery life is very long and very convienent. A little pricey but it is well well worth it. It is amazing. In the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced. After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working months of use which was frustrating. Then after or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running. A tip for people looking into this computer DO NOT BUY IT save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last. Has a hour battery life. It is easy to use and lightweight. Was very much worth the price i paid. This netbook went bad on me after days. There is a blank lighted screen when I start and that is all. Three weeks after I bought the netbook the screen quit working. I baby my electronics so I know for a fact it was defective and not anything that I did to it. Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality had poor performance although it did have great battery life when it did work. Took the netbook on a vacation trip and I was able to do whatever I wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop. The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it Do not buy it It is the worst laptop ever The image is great and the soud is excelent. i love ths notebook. I love the glass touchpad. Easy learning curve. Also the display is exceptional I have loved this since i took it out of the box. The battery is really long. the features are great the only thing it needs is better speakers. Small and light weight. Speakers too small to be of any real use. Keyboard good sized and wasy to use. I like it Meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis. Needless to say not to happy with the product. This is a great machine The design is awesome quality is unprecedented. Apparently wellbuilt and gorgeous to look at the MacBook Pro is a winning combination of price and performance. It is by far one of the greatest investments I have ever made. Am very glad I bought it great netbook low price. Very good quality and well made. Great pick for portability and affordability. The black model also has a very nice seamless appearance one of the better looking notebooks I ve seen. The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions If you need an affordable entrylevel laptop this will fit the bill. I dislike the weight and size cubersome. I dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers. Overall it s ok. Laptop is advertised as a but the casing looks like that of a . This laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases. Peformance is good for the price. If you re not wanting to be mobile this is a good laptop to sit on a desk. Had to have this computer repaired twice in the first months after purchasing it. Not good for a person who gets online daily. May be better for the occasional web surfer. I just got this laptop for college and so far I am very happy with it. It is so much easier to use Good keyboard long battery life largest hard drive and windows And Toshiba is a quality supplier. I love this little one. The keyboard has a wonderful nature feel. great battery life. Keyboard is reasonable size. Small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel. Charger seems large for this class of computer. Great Laptop for the price works well with action pack games. The only thing that I have is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters would help if it was a little lighter then it is. but other then that I would give this product a in hafe stars. Good for every day computing and web browsing. A great computer for light home use and business use. Might not make the avid gamer happy but I don t really think that is what this computer is designed for. Crisp screen great battery life and plenty of storage. Very happy. He loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started. I would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school. MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG. THE PRODUCT KEY. IT WANT TAKE IT IT KEEP SAYING ERROR. HELP HELP OTHER THAN THAT GETS A GREAT LITTLE WONDER. It s fast and has excellent battery life. The screen shows great colors. I was surprised with the performance and quality of this HP Laptop. the speed is fine. But with A WAY Bigger Screen and IS able to connect to an HDMI. Love it. I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop and the battery life is amazing. I BOUGHT THIS LAP TOP AND THE CHARGE TIME DOSEN T LAST AS LONG AS THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE HOURS This computer is the ideal college companion. It s software and speed enable it to do amazing things. I am not happy at all with the product I purchased. A cheaper price should not equal a cheap product. It was over rated The Toshiba laptop was a great purchase. The price was very good and the product is top quality. The delivery was fast and I would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again. It has easy to use features and all the speed and power I could ask for. True quality at a great price I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great Toshiba is a great brand even though I haven t had it for a long time I am very happy with it The screen graphics and clarity and sharpness are great. I ve already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye d the computer when I took it out of my bag. I like the laptop overall. The only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time. Sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to work This is a great little computer for the price. Simple to use and great graphics. It has everything I would need for a home computer. I m very impressed. It was secure and easy to navigate. It is everything that I would want in a computer. Besides the great look it is a great machine. Once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts. I enjoy very much my new Toshiba purchased specifially for attending online schooling. I have found it very easy to use very imformative wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs. I have found also it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access; without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so. I also love the small convenient size of my laptop making it a perfect tool for my academic studies. I am very pleased with my purchase This laptop serves all my needs. Screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment. Price and purpose is awesome I have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop. The battery life seems to be very good and have had no issues with it. Great product. The laptop was very easy to set up. Everything was so easy. They were able to setup with labtops themselves within a few minutes. It works fine with our wireless and they ve had not problems. It s a great product for a great price Waited on getting this computer but it has been a great change. Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac. The service I received from Toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty. My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance picture quality and ease of use. It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere. Just what the doctor ordered. I cannot be happier with the service or product. power supply went bad after weeks after much effort and days ASUS replaced it The WiFi is very weak. Summary Spend your money elsewhere This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life. Love it so far. The Toshiba Net book operates very well. The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows system is a starter and charges for the upgrade. I bought this netbook for traveling and it s great light functional and meets my needs. The touchpad is extremely sensitive which is the only drawback. Otherwise I love it I wasn t really sure I wanted to spend that kind of money It Was a great deal after all. I LOVE it I should have bought one a long time ago. Not enough time for me to give it stars I ve had the MacBook Pro for about three weeks and it really is a great computer. I have only had PCs with Windows before so this takes a little getting use to. The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it s speed. It is fast booting up shutting down and connection with the internet. The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel. I think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive but I rather have a hard copy. If what you need is a machine to do some surfing email checking word processing and watching a movie or two this is the machine you want. It s priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box. Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents. the screen/video resolution won t increase to a higher resolution then x That being said it still runs video in full screen decently. The sound is a bit quiet if you re on a plane this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones. Bottom line I doubt you d be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine. Yes I thought the expese was a little much but I now realize you get what you pay for. I love my Apple it is quick and easy to use. I ve had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful english speaking from Vancouver techs that walked me through the processes to help me. I can t say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket. Money and time well spent Highly recommended The Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product. The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box all the functions works great. Speakers doesn t sound that great. Love the speed especially So glad I decided to upgrade I ve owned this labtop for less then two months already the mouse button has broke. Still under warrenty so called Toshiba no help at all. I m stuck w/ a broken computer. Will not buy another Toshiba this is my second not happy w/ either. I love its solid build light wt and excellent battery life for now . Excellent LED monitor and well equipped. I love the Apple products. The Toshiba Mini Notebook Model NB is a great little computer. It is easy to use its keyboard easily accommodates large hands and its weight is fantasic. Upgrading from Windows Starter thru Windows Home Premium to Windows Professional was a snap; both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary Product Key. Other installed features such as certain printer software are also most attractive. Ever since I bought this laptop so far I ve experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines. I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed. Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another and I am not kidding you I called different hours of the day and you ll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again since they make it sound like they don t have your history list of your calls right in front of them. It s a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them. And at one point they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop I bought the memory stick they recomended . Long story short since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one I didn t ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services they finally gave in. Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba I ll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba. Remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product. All I can say is WOW. This laptop is insane It s so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with. I bought a protector for my key pad and it works great This is definitely a computer worth the money; The mouse is a little bit different than what you re used to though it has one big flat panel and one full bar instead of two separate ones to click with but you get used to it quite quickly. AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer when they have a certain promotion/offer going of course Overall this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from. The Apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you Obviously this Macbook is PERFECT for me because it does exactly what I need in an easytofunction way. DEFINITELY recommended Not a bad laptop it s a bit slow but gets the job done. The lcd screen stopped working on mine after months. I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat. upon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had months left on the warranty. even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had months left on the warranty. Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture. English must have been his third or fourth language. His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test and it was failing. after trying to get some help he disconnected on me. After days being denied times and told off once I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt. Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me. After they found no other way they told me to courier it to them since they don t allow the use of the post office at my expense and sent me a page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn t be covered. I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me. They really do have the worlds very worst repair service. This computer gets very hot before shutting down. It is not ideal for children because of the temp. I Contacted HP about this situation and was given excuses without results. They didn t even try to assist me or even offer a replacement. I will never purchase a HP again ever. Let s just get this out of the way I love Apple But the Macbook is the best It is super easy to use. All you have to do is turn it on and it works. It is very durable I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet. I don t do any high tech stuff on it just write papers check mail and sometimes play games so I can t reccomend it if you are in the computer field. In the past four years I ve had it I have never once gotten a virus. I did have to replace the battery once but that was only a couple months ago and it s been working perfect ever since. I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use stylish fun awesome computer. Also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable easy to use computer. This laptop does everything I need it to very well. The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features. The screen is bright and the keyboard is nice; I find myself using the more than I thought I would. Battery is lasting about hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos. For those that care about noise this thing doesn t really make any; the processor doesn t seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on. I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it. I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff. Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in seconds. This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine; my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn t require a dedicated video card. Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase. Great quick laptop for the money. Right size and weight for portability. Battery life needs more life. Battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery. I love everything about it. The only downfall is the battery only last hrs when not plugged in. I would like at least a hr. battery life. Otherwise all other features are a This mac is great lightweight long battery life excellent transition from PC; THIS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE SINCE WE PURCHASED IT. I will NEVER buy Refurbished again I don t cae how cheap it is. Just don t waste your time and money on this. I tried giving it stars but I had to choose at least one but IMO NO STARS Summary Dont buy HP. If you buy pray you dont have major prolems. Runs Hot I thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an Apple product. After a little more than a year of owning my MacBook Pro the monitor has completely died. This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks and I am impressed with the intuition of the design the beauty of the product and the excellent technological advances associated with it. Then of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro. Now they are believers in the product. It is easy to use has great screen quality and every so light weight. This little netboook is helping me get work done I homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat. I am first time Mac Buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the Mac offers. I bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her it s very lightweight and the response for the computing she s doing Internet focused activity mail research etc. is excellent; The overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she d recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook. If you re looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphicsintensive game you d be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market. previous laptops were pc s still have them but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system. still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better but am very happy with the upgrade. Probably as good as you can get in a netbook does everything I ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses. Has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device. So far so good I ve been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory. I don t understand why only Windows Starter is included. Strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed This device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers. Enjoy that Toshib force and durability unparalleled Needs longer lasting battery More than to Hrs. Needs Power and Mouse Cable to Plug in back instead of side In the way of operating a mouse in small area. For the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop. Comfterbale to use light easy to transport. I love this product because it is Toshiba and its . It has no camera but I can always buy and install one easy. I had a USB connect but i can t use it because it is not compatible. That s the downside for me. But I would recommend this product. Satisfy what I paid for it. Good monitor and performed well. I am using the external speaker sound is good. Best thing is I can use existing bit old programs. I recommend for word processing and internet users. The games included are very good games. I would highly recommend this one to my friends I bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio. It works great for general internet use Microsoft Office apps home bookkeeping etc. It doesn t have a lot of frills but I didn t need any and being able to buy what I needed and not more than I needed was very important. This computer I used daily nice compact design. Excellent speed for processing data. And if you are a game player it works with World Of Warcraft wonderfully. All in all great item highly recommend it. i would have to say that overall its great Aside from the trial software and the short battery life lack of a webcam its great. Fast great visual Oh yea has no numeric pad on the side. Best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches to make less easier for people to hack into My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen. Great wifi too. The screen is a little glary and I hated the clicking buttons but I got used to them. Overall for the money this is a good deal. There is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer. The speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better. while the keyboard itself is alright the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons. I am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite I like the extra features I love the windows home premium. The battery life has not decreased since I bought it so i m thrilled with that. I also love the design the looks the feel and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull. I would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend. Couldnt not use it. Tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk. defective software. returned it to walmart. I would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front. I also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen. I went to Toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it. One of them seems to have worked. Its a good laptop for its value. use is easy. Features like the font are very blocklike and old school. Would like more trendy high tech features. The start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking. Keys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for days yet. Came fully loaded good. Seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ie Internet tabs programs etc simultaneously. I m really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer. Graphics are clean and sharp internet interfaces are seamless. Only issue is that it is a little slow and I m fixing that by adding more RAM. Sound card is limited though. The laptop is very lightweight can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight. It is small enough to fit in one of my purses Windows Starter is terrific no you can t change the background but I don t need to I use it just for school work. The battery life is amazing the versitility is outstanding. The ease of set up was terrific. I was even able to uninstall McAffe and install one of my Symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever. I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity because it is very sensitive. Keyboard is great very quiet for all the typing that I do. Screen is crystal clear yes it s small but it s a netbook Awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college. I couldn t believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge. I loaded windows via Bootcamp and it works flawlessly Simply amazing computer I really like the Mac Notebook but its very pricey. Love the graphics awesome programs including Garageband and really cool default background. But like I said before the only reason I don t currently have a Mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey. Waiting for the was well worth it great value for the price. Bigger HD better graphics card and a bid HD. There is nothing to complain about the system. I have used PC s and converting to this MacBook Pro was easy. If you have the money I suggest going for the I occassionaly use it for work via VPN and it has not given me any problems. The screen is nice and the images comes very clear the keyboard and the fit just feels right. I consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need. The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop. I ts nice to have the higherend laptops but this fits my budget and the features I need. I normally dont participate in reviews/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts... another satisfied customer. The apple MacBook is the best investment that I have ever made. The newer MacBook that I have purchased is one of the best computers. I am a college student and it has been very useful. It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer. It has a lot of memory and a great battery life. It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed. Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes. Iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites. The internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily. I have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me. The screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use very important for use quick typers. Overall this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase The graphics are stunning. It s wonderful for computer gaming. I would definitely suggest this laptop It is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all. It has many great programs such as ILife iPhotos and others. iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC. In addition all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations. This comes in very handy for me as an educator. iPhotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos. It allows you to automatically upload photos to your Facebook account with one click. In addition there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture. If you are looking for something reliable this is the laptop for you. This computer was awful I will never buy another computer from Dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how I was treated by the company. The computer first started malfunctioning months after purchasing it. It does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it. The system it comes with does not work properly so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all. When calling Dell for help reurn or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it. One year of trying to fix the computer by myself with help of friends and even help from computer experts I have given up on trying to fix it. This computer was awful I would never recomend it to another person. Those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall Yeah I wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire. That s how frustrating it was. It is so simple to use I use it more than my desktop. It is well worth the money it cost Very good investment. The new Macbook Pro inch is nothing short of amazing. The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied. BOUGHT FROM WALMART I BELIEVE THAT THIS LAPTOP WAS A REPAIRED ITEM. THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USEBROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY. NOW AM VERY APREHENSIVE ABOUT TOSHIBA LAPTOPS. WILL NOT EVERY BUY ANOTHERLOU This is a great value for the money. This is a great computer. We haven t had any problems with it at all. The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up. Overall though for the money spent it s a great deal. But let me tell you the mac book pro is so professional. Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer. For example when my husband turns the light out while I m on the computer. the screen brightness automatically adjusts. It is VERY easy to type on and feels great besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted. Oh it is such a great piece of equipment. Its Office compatible but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs. I get a ton of compliments on its size and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you re restricted to the width of your body for computing room. Very longlife battery up to hours depending on how you configure power level settings . I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows Starter to Win Home and it runs just fine. I play a lot of casual games online and the touchpad is very responsive. I wouldn t play a firstperson shooter with this mind but if you wanted to run MS Office email chat download a video listen to music from a certain fruitnamed music store and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in I d highly recommend checking this out. The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook screen size is not something I d stare at for the entire hours of battery life five days a week. Additional caveat the base installation comes with some Toshibaspecific software that may or may not be to a user s liking. Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT It really is perfect for work and play. I am able to play and media files just fine with it. Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome. The only thing that isn t perfect about this netbook is the speakers they are not loud at all but I expected that. I upgraded it s RAM to I am very happy with it. lots of preloaded software. the only problem is that i had to add gb RAM the computer was kinda slow. tosiba has a good reputation my llast computer was an acer. this is starting off good. What a great little laptop. Maybe not the cutting edge Satellite but it is a workhorse. I bought it to use in college and it is perfect. I dual boot with Linux and that other securityprone OS and it performs flawlessly. I made a perfect decision when I bought the Toshiba Excellent product for the money. No problems no lock ups no disappointments. Not super fancy but not super expensive either. Highly recommend for daily use. The Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks. I have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed. Toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done. I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in. This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions. As well as having the plug in the computer come loose. So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good. It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there. The Mac Book Pro performs flawlessly. Never had a single problem and don t have to worry about viruses. While I mostly use it for email internet and gaming I m confident all other applications live up to the high standard I ve come to appreciate from Mac laptops. Worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment. Right out of the box this little netbook did everything I asked of it including streaming the everyday video you re bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously . It even has a great webcam and Skype works very well. The fact that you can spend over on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine. The Windows Starter is in my opinion a great way to think about using your netbook basics basics basics. I wiped nearly everything off of it installed OpenOffice and Firefox and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price. This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop my wife and I have another laptop or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks. I use this for my tutoring business and since I m always bouncing from student to student it is ideal for portability and battery life yes it gets the hours as advertised . ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them. little short on RAM but you get what you pay for. the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer left right and front. the headphone and mic jack are in front of touchpad making the touchpad hard to use when using headphones/mic not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person. Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction. I love windows but i can t give Toshiba any credit for that unless y all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time. I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty. The computer was shipped to their repair depot on june and returned on July seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned. They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place. The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba. The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue. Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some miles by air to Louisville Ky. And Toshiba is totally unconcerned. The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter. We don t Mind and You don t Matter. I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter. When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you don t matter. Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service. I ve tried going back to XL but there still problems. The technical service for dell is so world it might as well not even bother. Just a bunch of idiots who s English as a language is forced at best. I m all for saving money but Dell needs to step it up. Good price. Basic computer. Didn t work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop same make/model . It has worked fine. Handles all my basic media needs easily. Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display. It is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not. It s a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs. It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part. The GB of RAM is plenty able to run Windows and at least or other programs with next to no slowdown. My one complaint with this laptop is that I ve noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in. This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components and I m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator but I still expected better product quality for this price range. Other than that I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semidecent gaming capabilities. Let me start with the good So awesome. Great OS fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port. This one has had the same effect. The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual but substantive. The Unibody construction is solid sleek and beautiful. It is everything I d hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint but somehow a bit more sturdy. For the not so good I got the stock screen which is VERY glossy. It s still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook. The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlledlighting environment like me I prefer it dark or if you can crank up the brightness. The statement of hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration it s a lie. I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than hrs out of it. The first full charge of this battery got me only about full hours. Enabling the battery timer is useless. The Time remaining goes from hours plus to less than hours over the span of about minutes. It s so bad that I m thinking I only got half a battery or something. I know what hrs of battery looks like. My only other complaint is that it gets really hot. If you buy this don t go into it expecting hrs of battery life and you ll be perfectly satisfied. The pro is a great product I wish that the inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge the edges hurt my wrists . Other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more. Great product by Apple with the new great looking design. I actually had the hard drive replaced twice the mother board once the dvd drive twice then they FINALLY agreed to replace it ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN YEARS only to get another HP/Compaq piece of crap. It was slow locked up and also had hardware replaced after only months So buyers beware It is made better thicker and all out tough I droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and IT is still working with NO issues I love the easy to see screen and It works well for work persoal or just play. I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba. My friends or children use that when they need to borrow the Net = When I out grow this Meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one ANd I will be buying only TOSHIBA I just love this lap top I just wish it were all silver or they had all black. That is my only complaint LOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET WOULD PAY MORE FOR IT IF I HAD TOO I recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it It meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling. I am totally satisfied with my little toshie From the moment I opened the box to the present it has been a great joy. It is always reliable never bugged and responds well. I love the operating system and the preloaded software. This machine delivers. It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine. It is a bit heavy. It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required. Had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in. This is an oversized laptop. It wouldn t fit in most bags. I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard doesn t light up on this model. It also does not have bluetooth. You ll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them. I was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing I took it for granted that these features were standard. Overall still a very nice machine. Boots up fast and runs great I m pleased. The acer one compuer is a great computer. I didn t want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice. Its fast has High definition quality in the videos. The pictures are clear as can be. If I had to buy another computer I would most definetly buy an acer one computer. Heck if I had enough money I would but it as a gift for someone. Im glad that it has such great features in it. It also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home. Clear picture on it and everything. The one down side to it is that when I play a certin game on here it tends to freeze up sometimes but thats the only bad thing about this computer. The acer one computer that I bought is ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it but I like the big screen on it. Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies. Im very happy with this computer It s solid. Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system. The only downfall is a lot of the software I have won t work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it. It seems to be incompatible with everything else. But the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X. i love to use it it is esay and light. this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with. i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria. this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures. i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing. the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm. i can use it for all of my needs. i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me. if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again. i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go. From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly. The track pad to me is what really stands out though you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad awesome thinking Apple The OS is also very user friendly even for those that switch from a PC with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS Apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience From the start when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine. The ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it. The screen is bright and clear the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice. Fast fast and fast the web pages just fly by. I had my IWORKS Itunes Email MS Office network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour. That includes transferring my music and movies. Good bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too. If your time is worth anything to you if you are tired of rebooting reformatting reinstalling trying to find drivers if you want a computer to work for you for a change make the change to this computer. It is light and the battery last a very long time. Very fast boot up and shut down. Let me tell you this machine is great. Purchased for development purposes but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing email etc. I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC. The most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing. The only time I have restarted is during system updates. great machine if you want to drop the cash for one. Ok this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple. The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum. The processor screams and because of the unique way that Apple OSX functions most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software. I have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one. I like it so much I bought another just for my wife. Took it back as it was defective. Page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something. Couldn t keep a page up you were working on was a great deal i will give that. the laptop preformed pretty well. it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once. it has times were it freezes for seconds and then starts again. the mouse on the pad the left button always sticks. the mouse is way way way to sensitve. i tried turning it done but it did nothing. the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too. its not bad just VERY VERY annoying. think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop. I am very happy with this laptop. For the price and what I get out of it has exceeded my expectations. I always have used a tower home PC and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance. Amazing Quality Plus stylish. The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies pictures and etc The flaws are this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X. Mac is not made for gaming. BUT there s this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows. Second it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated Was not happy with one of the programs on it. It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer was a six month trial. Also the extended warranty was a problem. The extended warranty for the and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu. Overall the computer is very easy to use the screen is perfect great computer my daughter loves. I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it. I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased. So I m disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority. I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I won t have to worry about a crash. I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly dissatisfied with it. The Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning. It freezes and it always shows that there is an error so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it. I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem. Well I started using Google Chrome which is a little better but it freezes too sometimes. This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update so if you don t save your files and information everything will be lost. Another issue I have with it is the battery. Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden. There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle and when I click on it it says Consider replacing your battery and it does not hold full charge. It is not even a year old yet so I would definitely not recommend it to anyone. Don t waste your money The laptop is gorgeous. It is sleek smooth and lightweight. It is easily portable and I take it everywhere I go and might require internet access. The screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution. The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications. It is quiet and a real joy to watch work. I love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky Overall this laptop is great. It has plenty of memory lots of hard drive and great graphics. It runs very quiet too which is a plus. The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible. They only stay charged a little over an hour. Laptops are usually used on the go so why not give you a better battery The processor a AMD Semprom at ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing. The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a Svideo port that would enable one to hook it to a TV. It is a cheap throw together. Save your money and go for a better device. This laptop is a great price and has a sleek look. Runs smooth and quick. I wish it had a webcam though then it would be perfect I Love my new computer Its fast and another thing I like is that it has three USB ports. I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both Thank you for your great product Everything about this computer is easy to use. wonderful features. The only thing is that the battery won t last more than an hour. It discharges too quickly. Kind of annoying but I still love the laptop. It has good speed and plenty of hard drive space. The only downfall is the volume control. The wheel that turns the volume up and down doesn t work in real time. I have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute. I bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since. I love it so much. It has come into good use for my finances scheduling my parents business expenses and it is definitely amazing for gaming. The best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once it never slows down. It s just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open. It works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box. GREAT INVESTMENT The price and features more than met my needs. The feature are good enough for what I need. I love my macbook pro My laptop is almost old and I have never had any problems with it. If you are a PC user looking to convert I would HIGHLY recommend it It may take a little getting used to but you don t have to worry about viruses or other headaches. Not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs. I am ADDICTED to photo booth It is SO much fun to play with. I work with kids and they love making short videos on there. I am able to organize my pics music and files easily. If you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac I love the keyboard. The display is awesome. Only thing I would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive. But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers. I think this computer is super lame. I dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing. I decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it. It doesnt work worth a damn. The display is beyond horrible. I can not even read what I am writing half of the time. There are so many things wrong with this product it just makes me want to set my self on fire I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage. Not to mention it has shit gigs. I could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage. Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop. I bought this last week and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touchmouse stopped responding. got another and same issue. I am taking back today. Don t waste your money or time. Very dissappointed becase I have had toshibas for years and never a issue. STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my oneyear warranty was up. Toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it. Apparently there is a manufacturing defect something with the amount of thermal paste. TOSHIBA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM. When I called Toshiba they would not do anything and even tried to charge me for the phone call even though they didn t offer any technical support. I loved the netbook minus the fact that it was windows OS until this started happening. But if you can t make your product last more than a year you will not get my business again. I ve had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it In those three years I ve had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily. My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan. In the three years I ve had my MacBook Pro I have never had a virus on my computer and I do a lot of work on the internet. The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product. I highly recommend this product Needs constant repair. First the screen goes completely out. Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up not able to connect. Now the screen is going darker darker darker. HP is more interested in selling extended warranties which cost more than the netbook new then they are in helping or fixing. Oh yeah don t forget the expensive shipping to and from HP. I v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook of course a different brand. So far so good with this laptop. Fan vents to the side so no cooling pad needed great feature Screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive. Memory is upgradable. The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys. They click. sounds like a typewriter but if you can get past that this is a great laptop for a little money I HATE this one. Vista is a nightmare. No tutorials on the display. The book is useless. The machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your HDTV. Thinking about returning it The Macbook is a fantastic laptop. You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it. The macbook rarely requires a hard reboot. It just works flawlessly Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action. I honestly love my mac thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict. This was purchased for my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised. It had the full sized touch pad with buttons instead of just one. It made the computer much easier to use and navigate. Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel. This system came loaded with Windows Starter. So far so good. When I got this laptop in to help me with school I had a hard time from beginning. I feel that it was poorly put together because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it. Quite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned. For me five stars is not enough. I love the MacBook Pro. My parents bought it for me as a graduation gift and i m totally almost kind of maybe definitely obsessed with it. It was very easy to just pick up and use It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS. I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for Internet artwork and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable. There are several programs for school or office use Pages Numbers Keynote etc. music Garageband photo management Photo Booth iPhoto videoediting or moviemaking iMovie etc. The builtin webcam is great for Skype and similar videochat services. iTunes is a handy musicmanagement program and it is essential for anyone with an iPod. Allinall I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone. I love it They definitely have a superior product Its not just slow on the internet its slow in general. No I am generous calling it slow. its more like a snail crawl. he can t stand it. I can t begin to say how disappointed I am. I should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer. the key bindings take a little getting used to but have loved the Macbook Pro. Delivery was early too. It allows me to do everything I need from a computer and more. With awesome graphics and assuring security it s perfect I d recommend this laptop to anyone The Toshiba Satellite laptop is DESIGNED to fail The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues. Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it. I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired. Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I d have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty. It has far exceeded my expectations for power storage and abilitiy. It is easy to navigate and update programs. I ve never had problems with viruses. My next laptop will also be a Mac I would like to tell you about the best laptop I just got from Mac. My mac laptop is fabulous in both areas. It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit. The Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer which is also a mac. I would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could. In my line of work I often have to take work home and this makes it so easy. I do transcription work on the side and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well. The apple care has never failed me and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well. I will only buy apple laptops from now on. Great laptop for school easy to use for beginners in the household. Keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable. Battery life could be better but overall for the price and Toshiba s reputation for laptops it s great My MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment. From the build quality to the performance everything about it has been subpar from what I would have expected from Apple. The system constantly overheats the battery life is too short the case is coming apart and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Screen is awesome battery life is good. Really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints. Good laptop for the money. Speakers don t get that loud but good enough. They don t crash. If a website ever freezes which is rare its really easy to force quit. Never been hacked. No viruses. I have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free even without the warranty. A mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense. Its also FUN to use The programs are great like iphoto love the editing capabilities imail which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad imovie etc. She said its very user friendly. However I love this particular Mac because its very fast great size and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad. I am very happy I bought this Mac well worth the extra money. Now that I have it I see that I really needed this for much more. I run Dreamweaver Final Cut Pro Photoshop Safari Firefox MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time. I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing. I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door. That was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought. My MacBook Pro is no exception. Since I ve had this computer I ve only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth. I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad. The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it iPhoto iMovie iWeb iTunes GarageBand is all very helpful as well. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality Shiny This Laptop is the Best of the best The Awesomest of the awesomest. It is so great I can Hardly ever take my hands off it My friends are in awe every time they come over I got it for Christmas and I was so excited to set it up It is super fast and always loads. I am just amazed. The only bad part is the size/weight. It s like punds but if you can look past it it s GREAT If you don t like fingerprints this might not be the laptop for you. It super shiny so you can see the fingerprints easily. All for such a great price. It s color is even cool. Another Great thing is the Beast graphics. They are so realistic I am just speechless. I let my friend borrow it and she knows nothing about computers and she used it with ease. The cool thing about this is anyone can use it. I don t know how I could ever live without my Qousmio. I own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I ve had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb Ive had to call tech support many times. Each time taking about day or so. I had to wait weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly. I had to pay for the shipping I will never buy anything from HP again The Toshiba Satellite has been more than I expected for the price. THis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse. You can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever. for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is. when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke. but after i got used to it i love it. the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming. it has usb ports sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion. the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have. overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive. i use my mac all the time i love the software the way it takes a short time to load things how easy it is to use and most of all how you don t have to worry about viruses. With a mac you don t have to worry about antivirus software or firewall it s so wonderful. All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed. this computer will last you at least years thats an amazing life spanned an electronic. everything about a mac is wonderful it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system but you will learn fast and its all worth it. Not working = bad I spent dollars on a top of the line laptop . I got the blue screen of death the first month I got it. Payed for a premium laptop Blue screen first month Horrible customer supportthey lost my laptop for a monthgot it back months later Laptop still did not work blue screen within a week... Cut my losses and sold it for parts this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this never happen... what an elegant wonderful machine. I m making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the old way and Apple does indeed have the better idea. I really wish I had done this years ago. Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure talk about painless syncing used to take me forever now it s a snap. I love it never had a computer I was so impressed with and I ve had a lot of laptops and desktops this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE. I tell everyone that I know friends family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used. The computer blinks it shuts off at will. The letter A stopped working after the first week. when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is twenty three days from the date of purchase. so the fact that the computer does not work on the twenty fourth day is my fault. they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem. they have not sent a new one nor called. i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus. then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east. So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand. Then to make matters worst there is noone that they can transfer you to. I had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair. Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it. weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications. DO NOT BUY GATEWAY COMPUTERS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS HORRIBLE. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY. COMPUTER HAS BEEN AT SERVICE FACILITY MORE THAN IN MY HANDS. I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied. The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones. Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed to send it in to fix it. That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the and it was fixed. It took a little over weeks until i got it back. ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke. To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk. The graphics are great. The internet speed is spectacular. The battery life is probably an hour at best. Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good. I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about. I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month. I received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst. At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again. This computer doesn t do that well with certain games it can t play some and it becomes too hot while playing games. Oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn t come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is for two cds. the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop. I bought a HP Pavilion laptop and have had so many problems with the computer. The computer is so slow even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up. They said it was a computer error on this type of computer. Also I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot and not even sitting on anything to make it hot. When the computer has been on for several minutes it will occasionaly just go off by itself. Also the battery does not last very long at all. I would recommend not buying this product. I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem. I am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with. Also I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly. Also I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines. It gets stuck all of the time you use it and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work. Sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer. Will probably never buy a HP again. Purchased a Toshiba Lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out. After the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace. I hate it. I have had the luxury sarcasm of owning of these laptops. The first fell apart right after the During that time I had to send it back times. I paid about for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me. None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing. They would repair one thing send it back and it would still have the same problem. The processor went on me the fan went and the motherboard went. I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused because they knew it was trouble. I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty. I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about for the extended warranty. I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT. I waited and waited and no laptop. Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box. I waited another month for approval and for them to BUILD me a new laptop. Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing. HP didn t fix it. I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one. in months the connect quality got worse and worse. time they got it working the next month they had me send it in. returned it. months dead again. They say sorry out of warranty. Summary They played games with me for the warranty period. Now months later they want would not say exact amount to to fix the machine. They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything. Now the machine won t connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for days and now I m out of warranty even though this has been a constant month occurance since I bought the netbook. So buyer beware when buying Toshiba They are wonderful but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat. I burned my leg after lifting it from my desk and for less than second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table so I can place it there. I had to call Apple times each time to minutes on the phone and take it to their store for evaluations and diagnostics times. For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin it happened months ago they offered me an ITouch you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich offer a loyal customer like me a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this . Steve Jobs probably needs help and donations and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby. The lesson learned here is It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible as fast as they can and in this day and age the customer no longer is right all the times. I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop. Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone. So I called customer support which is good too and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all I just chose to hide the message. Also the speakers are not very loud But it is a netbook. Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though. I custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the techie due to his accent. The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork. My laptop cost approximately and DIED after only and of use. Although my model was listed as recalled HP denied my claim. This laptop leaves alot to be desired I have had it only months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice... I bought it from HSN because it was bundled with extra software but as it turns out that software just crashes it more often..... If you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal. The repairs were made quickly though I must say however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me. Unable to boot up this brand new laptop. Spent hours on phone with HP Technical Support. They went through asking me open up various components taking battery out hard disk apart and after hours on phone could not fix it. They are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site. I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from This computer had exactly the specifications I needed. Small enough to use on a long flight Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips. The perfect notebook... When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed. The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid I have tried both Motorola and HTC plugged into the USB port. Called tech support and got the usual Acer We don t support software but for $$$ we can help you I explained there was no software involved in booting. No tey don t even support their own bios and it could be a problem with the bios How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity Needless to say a PC that can t support a cell phone is less than useless With today s company fighting over marketshare its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone. I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION. Summary I ve had this laptop for months out of the blue the power adapter stops working. But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back days later to be told that it takes days for turnaround time. This was the day and part still had not been shipped. The rep did not even answer my question I had to ask him if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn t even try to acknowledge my question. I m tired of the inept service. If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can t find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small. I M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE. HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK Our Apple MacBook Pro Notebook Computer Notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking. I do everything on this computer check email facebook shop check blogs write papers listen to music and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv. It pretty much does everything we could ever need and looks great to boot. Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things they always come up with good looking products. It didn t take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation it s been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better. So if you re thinking of a laptop I would heartily recommend theApple MacBook Pro Notebook Computer Notebook for all your needs It s great and we will always stick with Apple computers we have been so happy with them. The MacBook Pro is portable durable and very capable. It has a hour battery life when you re doing web browsing and word editing making it perfect for the classroom or office and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ll have a battery life of just over hours. It s also very energy efficient running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a Watt lightbulb. It s graphics aren t bad at all for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics. The operating system and user interface is very intuitive and the large multitouch track pad is amazing. However the multitouch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you re gaming . Still this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work. They also have a longer service life than other computers I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks . Probbly the worst decision we ever made It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were. i love the size of the computer since i play games on it. i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have. also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard. So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer First it does not have a push button to open the lid. It is held in place magnetically. There is a little indent to help open it but good luck with that. Once open the leading edge is razor sharp. This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design. Using this machine is like a mild form of torture. The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare. I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening. Also the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it. I hate to say this but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back then I would. It is absolutely horrible to use despite all its so called advanced features. I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use. It s a bummer and one out of five is being kind. My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary. In due course I ll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs in the trash. But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing. I like this machine because its very lightweight... very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent... hours of battery life is really something else.... I highly recommend that you buy this product. It crashes and when it goes flat it just DIES like a PC maybe worse and I loose all my open documents I Hate it It is the easiest computer I have ever used I LOVE IT I can t say enough good for it It s A MAC I fine Apple Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go. I like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races. It s face and depanable. As a graphic arts a retired instructor I still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art ..... it s just a great toy to have around. very very slow laptop. tons of bloatware and junk programs. can t reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers. keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed. lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small. Amazing machine. It is a big big but since it has a screen what would you expect It is truly a Desktop Replacement. Very fast and efficient Does a great job with video shot on a Canon MKII. Very happy with my Toshiba laptop The touchpad is very intuitive so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again Of course I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork GarageBand and iMovie. I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets and rather quickly too. I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows on it by using the VMWare program. Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac I also got the added bonus of a HD Monitor which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh I never have had a good result with this computer. I was told by many that it was a great computer but we got one of these and it worked great for one year and as soon as the warrenty was up then it got really bad. They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer not what I ve done. The hard drive crashed as well and I had to buy a new power cord. They told me to reprogram the computer and I didn t need to do that and I lost pictures of my oldests first years of her life. I don t like this company nor the toshiba brand and I ll never buy another one because I ve put more into it then it is worth. I would rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that isn t good at all. The right speaker did not work. Again the same problem the right speaker did not work. I returned the laptop for a full refund. the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i ve ever seen. sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move. the mouse buttons are hard to push. i cant believe HP put this out. do not buy you will be disappointed. i m returning mine dell is a decently made pc. the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side. with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch. so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop. I love HP it s the only computer/printer we will buy. This is perfect for her field. At first when I got this product I loved it. The computer itself was fast ran smoothly and had no problems. Then within months the charger crapped out on me. So I called Compaq and after being on the phone for hours i finally got a replacement which I shouldn t have had a problem getting since it was under warranty. months later the battery went. They gave me a hard time yet again but their was a malfunction in the battery itself it didn t die. THEN one month after the warranty expired the replacement charger went. I had to pay for a universal charger for this cheap laptop. Not worth it one bit. The people are frustrating to work with the product itself is very cheaply made and the accessories are less than satisfactory. Also my sister got the exact same laptop since they were so cheap and after months the screen split in half just from everyday use. Apparently under the screen there are little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth they come loose. And it is impossible to get them back in. Strengths Wellshaped Weaknesses A bad videocard After min the screen of the notebook switched off. It was still working but there was nothing on the screen. I was said it s videocard. Very disappointed Didn t expect to repair it at once Don t buy this model. An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will. Mine came at w/o a DVD burner . The screen is framed by half to a fullinch margin that is obviously unnecessary reduces the screen size and increases the bulk. The USB ports are nice but the two on the side only work now and then. Keyboard could use some trimming. Did I mention everything about it from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK I m glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC. The benefits were immediate Awesome graphics The magnetic plugin power charging power cord is great I even put it to the test by accident excellent innovation This laptop rocks only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD which Apple doesn t support I ve saved a lot of time and headaches so far using my new MacBook Pro. I have never had any issues or problems with my MacBook Pro so far and it is still as fast as it was when I first bought it. I especially like the backlit keyboard. It makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier. It is also very lightweight making transporting this computer very easy. The graphics on this computer are also stellar very clear and vivid. I use iphoto all the time which is a great program for anyone who is into photography amateurs and experts alike. The program came with the computer and works beautifully. I definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails. My hp died after only months. It started out getting hot after only a few months. At months it started shutting off after only or minutes. I use a cooling pad but it doesn t help. I took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it. I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro It fires up in the morning in less than seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing. This is now my MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile. I love it I even got my teenage son one because of the features that it offers like iChat Photobooth garage band and more We are addicted to the Mac. This is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone. The OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it Great laptop that offers many great features Lightweight and the screen is beautiful It is easy to operate and I have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new Rolls Royce of laptops. Buy it love it and I promise you won t regret it. This computer is good for days then it sucks for the rest of your life. You will regret it if you buy any dell. Dell sucks The only pro to this computer is it was under Everything is falling apart internally and externally. With in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down. I am constantly trying to uninstall programs clean cookies and delete unused files. Nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan. More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection or the page can t be displayed. It takes me approximately tries to get to each site then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works. I have Vista so I am unable to install and uninstall some programs. I can t even install one of the printers I have in my house so I am unable to print. Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit and the screen has a terrible glare. In short I would never buy a Compaq again. I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it It was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to. The online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a PC. The performance is awesome. I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar. With all the goodies inside this machine it is a value. It is very well built. The keyboard is top notch. The touch pad is among the best. The screen is huge and coloful but no LED backlighting. The video card is great for media and above average for gaming but not a gamers first choice. The problem I had with this unit was unresolvable. It had a cooling system malfunction after minutes of general use and would not move past this error. I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card but still requires a return. Sorry Toshiba but impressions do count for something. I got the black MacBook two years ago and have never regretted it. So this was great for me. It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs. Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work. I also travel with it and it never gives me any problems. But I am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it. I look forward to years of use it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well. The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space. It s super fast and a great value for the price I would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one. A MONTH LATER we reinstall the OS Vista . A coupla months later they change my hard drive. A month or so ago the freaking motherboard just died. Went silently. One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it the next day I turn it on no GUI screen all dark power light steady hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does. THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD And I m still paying the bloody financing for a product which didn t last me at least three years I initially purchased my Macbook Pro in April and I loved it. I was so happy with my new Mac. Then the hard drive failed; my information was all lost my fault I know but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac the paragon of all computers So after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another months of my new computer until it froze this morningcompletely. I can t even turn it off. It s catatonic. Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it s like new I might have months next time. I would rate this computer at stars but considering it has a short life span I can only give it and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine. Great battery speed display. It WORKS My house is now Macbook. The Macbook starts fast doesn t crash has a fantastic display is small and light I have the model and isn t always complaining about updates lost connections errors blue screens etc. THIS is what a laptop is supposed to be. I thought the price was great for the specs. But after using it a couple of weeks the overall operation is poor. I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it. The keyboard is too slick. I really don t like it but I am stuck. Dell Latitude is not a reliable machine. The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes. Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months. The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely. VERY disappointing I was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain Flash. Web access through the network is so slow it s very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING. After purchasing this thing I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera and that it cannot be purchased at the store only on line. HP Pavilion Notebook PC When I first got this computer it really rocked. But as time went on I found it almost impossible to keep the thing online through wifi. Eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on. Guess I ll stay away from HP. My MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made. I have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it. The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me but I have just been using firefox instead. I love this computer. Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere but still has a big enough screen to get everything done. The only thing that I don t like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to. Games being the main issue. It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can t play it because its not compatable with the software. Other than that I don t have one complaint in the world This computer periodically crashes Office IPhoto Safari . It takes a long time to get on the Web and to change Web Sites. Locks up she searching for updates. It seems that this computer might be a lemon. I purchased my Macbook Pro Retina from my school since I had a student discount but I would gladly purchase it from Amazon for full price again if I had too. The Retina is great its amazingly fast when it boots up because of the SSD storage and the clarity of the screen is amazing as well. But if you buy this i would highly recommend that you buy a case and screen protector for this machine as they are known to be quite fragile. Count me as extremely satisfied it s a perfect computer. I just bought this computer from the Apple Store and I couldn t be more impressed with it. It has a stunning retina display and is very fast. This computer is good for anything and it has really superseded my high expectations. Also the sound quality from the speakers is crystal clear and everything is just sleek and smooth. The HD display is sensational and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me. No hardware issues as is common with any Apple product. Great product and couldn t be happier with it. awesome laptop i love it I love my new ThinkPad It gives me everything I need from a computer and with the long lasting battery it also gives me mobility. I can use it anywhere. It was a great purchase. All the sturdy and substantial feel you expect from a Thinkpad. Average performance on almost every benchmark but priced accordingly. Below average on the wfi adapter which I m still trying to get to the bottom of. Great laptop. Fast. Works very well. Would purchase again. A good value for the money. Quite pleased with it. Fast enough for my purposes. No bloatware from third party parasites to uninstall. Excellent keyboard and crisp screen. Battery could be better but it has robust processor and plenty of RAM so that is a trade off I suppose. I m glad to have it and it showed up in only a few days. The laptop itself is very good it could be better but not bad at all for it s price point. It does everything I need. The big deal with this was Windows When I saw this I grabbed it. It has met all my needs. Just what I expected. I don t have any complains about this computer Outstanding laptop and very well built. The retina display is fantastic. One of the best thing i have bought in years. Great PC light and powerful. Is just amazing.= The glare of the glossyretina display is unbearable. Do not buy a mac until this issue is resolved. Performs as advertised if not better Super light weight I never cared either way about weight until now . Feels like solid state. WONDERFUL machine; glad I bought it. Tiny forgivable drawback no ethernet cable outlet. But that s not a dealbreaker. SUPER LAPTOP Will probably get another one for my wife a bit ugly but works good I like the design rather sleek and light. I will give advise any prospective buyers this is not great laptop Its good for web browsing and word processing Fantastic for the price just wish it the keys were illuminated. If your on a budget.... Save up longer. This laptop isn t worth a single cent. I couldn t even install linux on it. Windows runs very poorly. Just save your money and get something better. awesome price for a laptop that lasts more than hours without recharging awesome This laptop is a complete cheap junk. By just looking at it you will realize it s crap. It s not what you pay for. The case is made from cheap plastic. In the description it said there is Bluetooth but no there isn t. I m warning you You re wasting your money on this Love the computer. Hate Windows It dosn t even have a disc compartment Had to return the computer. Keeps freezing No ethernet outlet Disc drive will not open or function Odd unusual Dell Commands Would have exchanged instantly but had to use as if for College immediately. Unimpressed. Terrific laptop. Works beautifully. great price. just what we needed for our daughter to do her on line math class This is a great home computer. It is very very quiet. The only reason I didn t give it a star is I feel I have to reach so far to type on the key board. You also have to press firmly on the keys. Otherwise this is a great computer great prices. Was easy to set up and has been easy to learn to use it. Works good and is fast enough for me. Good product for a good price. It was too cheaply constructed. It also gave me an introduction to Windows which I hope will be discontinued it the future. The Computer Is Horrible Its To Slow. The Thing That You Insert CDs Into Won t Open. not a good computer at all. We returned two days later. They were excellent to handle our return and post our refund back into our account the next day. Great price and computer They loved it. It s easy to operate and it s very light my parents are almost yo they can t carry a heavy computer while traveling . But here s something I hadn t realized before buying it there isn t an optical drive which means NO CDs or DVDs This product was DOA. Fired up and worked for the first day and then the display died on my wife while she was taking a timed test. Would not recommend. Pretty good laptop. Good for basic stuff. Don t try to use to play any pc games or anything. Just for simple web browsing and media streaming. Pretty premium feel for the low price. I have so much trouble turning the computer on. It comes on for seconds then shuts itself off. My mistake was to not research this one no DVD and no place to insert my ad card to download pictures. I should have waited to find a higher quality computer. i m very happy this laptop is beatifull is nt slow at all. but it doesn t have a cd unit anyway the other thing is that the laptop does not have an ethernet port for cable connecting. just wifi.... the screen is big and everything was as described For everyday use you can t really go wrong with this laptop. If like me you will be paying bills occasionally reading the news or just buying stuff on line Then this is a winner. If you are a gamer or need it for heavy computer use get something else. It s a good starter computer that is extremely light on the wallet. Like i said Good for basic stuff and as a starter. Still getting use to Window Has a built in camera which i do not use. Sturdy but only for typical wear and tear. Can not believe the price Amazing computer perfect for school. I ve had my Lenovo for a little over a month now and it does everything i want it to do and more. i really have nothing negative to say about it. The keyboard is a little wonky with having to use the Function button to get the Fkeys but with how infrequently i use those it is a nonissue. it is a great value for what you get. i can run somewhat modern games like Skyrim and Fallout New Vegas with no issues. I get giddy every time I use this thing. It is a thing of beauty and fast enough. When you click and don t wait. So yes it is ridiculously fast. The battery will get you from LA to NY no problem. THE DIFFERENT THAN MY OTHER COMPUTER SO WE HAVE TO GET USE TO IT. IT IS VERY LIGHT AND THE PICTURE IS NICE AND THE PRICE WAS AMAZING. CAN EVEN READMY KINDLE ON THIS COMPUTER excellent item shipped on time met my expectations it doesnt heat at all dont use it for gaming for the price this is a super product out of the box. It wont wow you with its speed but who can complain at plus this computer comes with a full size keyboard. NO junkware This computer is great for someone who is looking to manage their online life banling facebook etc and some basic offline work using MS Office. the only drawback is no DVD player.. but for you can buy an external one Very light and beautiful. It s just a little slow. five starts Terribly slow... Start up time took forever everything runs very slowly. Screen broke month outside warranty. Overall build quality is cheap. Avoid Acer. Not bad. Nice and light seems to help your work instead of becoming work itself. Perfect size for me. Probably not a gaming machine which I have zero interest in. i just love this ultrabook i defenitly recommend it for anyone for office and home work It s ok. I find that it often gets very slow and I have to restart more than usual. It s light and easy to use though. I love this computer this is my first ever Mac I m and it took a little while to switch over from the OS I was used to but it was a fast learning curve. The resolution is gorgeous the computer is light it does everything I need and the interface is pretty intuitive. I love this computer However I am very upset that it doesn t have the superdrive built in Supper east to use. Retina display is beautiful. Also very quick laptop Con Hate that it has no disk drive. I am also glad it doesnt get too hot when left on for an extended period of time. The battery life is good even with using high profile software like Sibelius for a good half of the day. Wonderful super fast lightweight computer The New Macbook pro working good user experience fast speed faster start up time. This is what I was looking for. It has a wide screen and it s easy to use. At my age I need this kind of laptop. Extremely slow. A masterpiece of crap. not durable . slow processor just not it I can t use the Trackpad very well it s too sensitive so I hooked up a mouse. External monitor worked easily. Been using Lenovo ThinkPad Edge laptops in our business for several years now and have no complaints about any of them. They have held up well not just in our sales department but also in our service department where they are exposed to dust exhaust grease oil and all manner of other noncomputerfriendly substances. GENERAL a quality laptop. The Lenovo software that comes preinstalled may qualify as bloatware but is easily removed if you re not interested in it. Windows rocks. Computer runs very slow Great Laptop Bigger screen than expected laptop with a desktop design that is really nice to use for all types of usage including programming/editing One of the very few laptops still available with Win Pro multiple USB ports and a DVD read/write drive. Only drawback is no LED to show when the hard drive is being accessed. Not a necessity but something I ve come to expect. Does what I need it to do and the price was right Great laptop from Apple Apple is unrivaled in terms of build quality and functionality. The retina screen is absolutely beautiful and the touchpad is the best touchpad to date. The pair allow for seamless navigation throughout the whole interface. Battery life is astonishing given the processing power and high resolution display. I can easily get hours out of a full charge. Overall a high quality laptop and a great value considering all this computer has to offer. Well worth the extra cost. Size is perfect and display is beautiful Excellent performance especially given its price point. The screen is wide and provides excellent clarity. It is not a small compact laptop but I won t be traveling via air often so its size and weight is not a problem for me. I can appreciate why she recommended it Don t expect much in terms of performance from this laptop. It gets the job done in terms of having a computer that can browse the web use Word/Excel and the like. This laptop does NOT have an Ethernet adapter for wired network connection. fast easy So far I do not have any trouble with it other than the picture quality is a bit poor. I have had it over a month now and it works just fine. This laptop suits my needs as i am currently studying online and just need a computer for that purpose. My daughter uses it for college too and it works great for both of us. So i gave this stars but only because of the poor picture quality other than that it is a great buy This laptop is absolutely horrible. I bought it simply for Excel on Windows for work since I have a Macbook Air and literally the thing freezes and lags opening Excel or my web browser. There is a chance mine is defective but regardless I m not going to try another one this is a terrible product. I d much rather bite the bullet and spend a little more for a product that actually meets minimum computing expectations for I appreciate the effort to hit affordable pricing Dell but just not worth it. It is slow and complicated and very disappointing Great labtop.. not as fast as I would have liked it to be but everything else is great I ve only had this computer for a few days an I already don t like it. The battery life is a joke and it s causing other problems. I will be returning it. If people are writing bad reviews about this laptop then believe what they say. This is an ok computer. The processor shows a speed of The sound is disappointing. No bass sound at all. Maybe this one is just a dud. the computer is very wonderful. was not aware it did not have a disk drive when i bought it or i would not of purchased it. it does have a habit of restarting itself when you try to do the log in pw. but over all. im very satisfied. its very fast and very light. great product. i am giviing it four stars instead of five because of no disk drive and the crashing I absolutely love my Dell Inspiron It powers on/off very quickly and it loads up automatically. The mouse click is a bit loud but it really isn t a problem. For I highly recommend very poor quality lap top.... I am returning it... Slow GREAT value laptop I can t believe this was just Speed is great easy to set up and get going. Very pleased so far. It is very difficult to use this computer. Too many steps to get anywhere and hard to set up This things run smoothly for its price and the battery life seems to go on forever. I wasn t disappointed in its performance. All in all it s well worth its price tag. Great laptop for the price. It was nearly impossible to find a laptop that had A a side keyboard. B a DVD/CD player. C a large hard drive instead of using the Cloud D was under with shipping. The only con is Windows effin Still giving it a star rating because it is fast and a nice sized screen. Great for web design and general work. Overall good but processing power isn t very good. Pro with pro upgrade is nice but it frequently freezes for a few seconds here and there. I replaced stock drive with WD Black drive and is still quite slow. Battery doesn t last long web browsing hours maybe . It has some bloat wear that I wish weren t there. It works fine for a PC in this price range. I bought it for my parents late and they love it particularly the keyboard and screen. Terrific value for the money. Love the key layout and the builtin mouse pad all work well and are properly sized. Highly recommended. works good but doesn t seem like it s made sturdy. kinda to light and plastic feeling. Killer computer. I would highly recommend this computer it is FAST Doesn t have touch screen but I have a tablet so that wasn t so important. Look and feel is good. I am experiencing the system little slower than what I have expected. And processor feels pressured even though I run medium scale programs watching the way exhaust speed increases. The hdd has a scratching noise. The system sometimes lags a lot. I don t like it at all... I can t put a protector to make presentation... A good value on a quality product. Easy setup and delivers all the functions we need. This laptop is amazing Despite the fact that there s no optical drive everything is perfect. The screen resolution is crystal clear the speakers are amazing and the track pad is easy to use. The home page/startup is easy to navigate which is the one thing I was mainly concerned about. Internet is fast and reliable battery life lasts a long time. I love this laptop LOOKS LIKE THIS DELL IS A PIECE OF CRAP. IT DOES NOT TURN ON IF I TAKE THE BATTERY OUT IT MIGHT WORK NOT SURE IF IT S A BAD BATTERY OR COMPUTER DO NOT RECOMMEND Awesome laptop Bootup time is amazing battery life is decent and it has a great slim form factor. There is somewhat of a learning curve but the operating system and hardware of this Mac are great. More than enough for my use. The display is vibrant and clear the keyboard is well designed and pleasant to type on; I even installed a windows partition to be able to run Windows software. Things just work they are fluid easy to use and understand fast and work well. This computer is absolutely perfect for web browsing watching video word processing and that s about it. If you want a computer that plays games or any advanced tasks like editing video this computer is NOT for you. Now when I say don t expect to play games on it I mean it. Pretty much every major game save for Solitare won t even play on it due to the slower processor. Its also worth noting that there no bluetooth no mircophone jack no ethernet no dvd/cd drive/burner and no usb ports. It DOES come with two usb ports a hdmi port and a webcam. The webcam is nothing special its there if you need it. Don t expect it to take good pictures or video. The battery is pretty soild. It lasts up to hours with normal use. The computer itself runs very quiet and is mostly cool to the touch. The only major negative to me is Windows though YMMV and the Dell crapware installed. Not bad for the price. I needed an inexpensive laptop to do basic office work on that was lightweight and this fits the bill just fine. Performance wise it s a bit slow but that s to be expected from a Celeronclass processor. I m also not a fan of Windows but fortunately I can install whatever I want on the laptop without issue. Love everything about this laptop Sound quality and touchscreen are awesome I would definitely recommend this I love this laptop to the moon. My favorite colors black and red the matte material and the red backlight of the keyboard. The sound is great and it s fast. The laptop is beautiful not extremely light but thin enough and wide screen with a full keyboard. The touch screen response is fast and it picks up bluetooth and wifi FAST. Microsoft Office is a day trial a number of games and apps are already preloaded. It s exactly like the picture and I AM SATISFIED. Great laptop light and very versatile it was easy to set up. I like the number pad for work so that s nice This is going to be random and unorganized but here are my thoughts on the laptop So far so good after a month. It took some getting used to on the Widows after being an XP user for many years. Everything seems to be running smoothly. Only downfall is the preloaded McAfee and other software. They are fine while the free subscription is going but a pain when they start asking you to spend money every time you login. Device is light weight quiet during operation and produces little to no heat. It has a quick start up and shut down time. The display is good quality. Just wish there were more USB ports. I AM IMPRESSED WITH THIS COMPUTER INEXPENSIVE BUT QUALITY. LOVE THE SIZE I AM USING THIS FOR WORK I AM A NURSE AND HAVE TO CHART DAILY THIS IS EASY TO USE AND I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT. It s so damn good I bought D If you re the type of person that just likes to browse the Internet and enjoy media and do light work with Microsoft office this is the laptop for you. Don t expect it to be a champion performer so if you want to play games or whatever this is not the computer for you. It s extremely light weight and slim because of the lack of an optical drive who uses those anymore anyways so it easily fits into any college students bag. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn t need much out of a computer. I am very happy with this computer. It is exactly what I expected and the price is excellent You are getting what you pay for and in my opinion it is worth more. Been using it for about hours now and it seems plenty fast and does everything I need it to do. Its a very basic laptop. I thought it would have a CDrom drive but there isnt one. Also wish it had a port to plug an internet cord into it because sometimes my wifi router likes to not work. But for the price its good. Other than the slow CPU it works great for everyday use. Heavy gaming is definitely not it s strong point. The cover is a soft rubber texture without the friction. Slick design and looks great. The machine is easy to use has the power it needs for personal use and some light professional work. It could be lighter but couldn t everything. The battery seems adequate for most uses ~ hour use/charge. Screen is clear and bright. Glad it has the DVD drive. Perfectly adequate. Great PC. The is incredibly fast the RAM makes it proper for several games not on maximum quality . Great sound quality too. Nice laptop. I use it for school its quick and has everything I need on it. Good battery life as well. Wifi card not working right out of the box. Dealing with HP support is a ridiculous and painful experience. I have spent more than hours on the phone with them over different calls only to get no where. Now I m looking into the return process which I m sure will just be loads of fun if my prior experience is any indication. Seriously save yourself the hassle and purchase from a different company. Used to love HP products but this has soured me on the whole company. By far the best laptop I ve ever had. Its fast powerful screen display is top notch and the battery life is excellent for a laptop of this size. My only concern is that since the battery is not external I will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time. I wonder if thats just Apples way of saying its time to get the newest and greatest laptop years from now lol. The product is average and works well. Works at a decent speed. The mouse pad however is very loud which is why i gave it four stars. I had a great experience purchasing my Dell Inspiron Laptop. My laptop was easy to setup and I ve had no problems to date. Did not disappoint me at all. Lenovo is the best laptop. Built in mike is really poor and unusable for Skype or any other purpose. And the only microphone input is for a combo Mike/Speaker plug. So to communicate I need to wear ear plugs or a headset with a builtin mike. That s a nuisance for family Skype calls...only one can speak at a time. We haven t used it enough or had it long enough to give it stars but so far it has been a very good laptop. Several other reviewers made comments on the keyboard and now I can understand why this keyboard is the nicest to use of any laptop we ve ever owned. I m a lifelong desktop computer user and the keyboard on this laptop is as close to a normal keyboard as I ve ever seen. We like this new laptop a lot Very good performer for the price. Not blazing fast but quick enough. One really nice thing about Lenovo laptops is that they are not cluttered with a bunch or trial software. The desktop was clean once I got it up and running. Battery life is above average and it charges quickly. Keyboard is sturdy. The touch pad takes a little getting used to as the click buttons are on top instead of the bottom. I will be considering Lenovo for all future laptop purchases. This lap top is good so far. It is quiet runs smoothly. I really like the video option on it I stream movies on Amazon Prime and Netflix and there is no lag. The only negative would be that it gets pretty warm sitting on my lap for very long but that is pretty much standard for all lop tops I think. it stopped working days after purchase. it was slow and might be problematic. i would shop around for a better one. CRASHED only days from getting it Says it is failing hard drive. I should have bought something better. The PC is works well with a good battery and a power cable and has a web cam. However it does not have a DVD drive neither does it afford one the opportunity to connect an external DVD drive as the manufacturer did not make any point ofconnection of an external drive. Other than a hate of windows she just loves it. The plastic materials are rather cheap. LOVE IT NEEDS MORE INSTRUCTIONS WITH IT I m very happy with my Acer it does just for what I need it. Even the sound is fantastic I love this laptop. Even my extremely tech savvy boyfriend was impressed with the features and sleek design. Although I ve had it for less than a week I am very satisfied. Functions well. Does all that was advertised. If it had a star option that is what I would give. The build is perfect the screen fantastic but I do have a bit of a problem with the fact that I have to buy adaptors for nearly everything from vga cables to ethernet cables so almost perfect... display. Love the color accuracy. decent speakers. fast. fan when watching video off YouTube. Sounds like a washer. Machine gets fairly hot near the bottom of the screen. Battery power laptop had difficulties computing. feels too heavy to me. Could lose another pound or two. Paid close to out the door. Biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased. This clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered. It would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for minutes. The second one after a little over a month refused to turn on even with a full charge. What a lemon This is a big disappointment. I only use a laptop for personal use but this one can t even handle that It takes a long time to load any page. I ve had it for a minth and so far it s shut down completely times. I have had Dell Desktops for years so had no qualms about buying a Dell laptop. Never again. I ve always sworn by dell. So with this new order all the upgrades and windows really caught my eye and I got this for the long haul. I am not ultra tech savvy but I can tell when it works slow I barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load. I m so disappointed. In two months both the power cord pin broke the company replaced it and then the CD drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into a million pieces. In addition no matter what I do to change the settings add/delete Flash etc. Firefox hangs on startup. It seems like Lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on. The cords always feel like they are in my way. One positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard which is larger than usual. It s a pleasure to type on. My final thoughts if you are a Mac user stay away. If you want to travel with this laptop don t buy it. It s clunky heavy and a pain to start up and shut down. Great for games It s truly a great laptop for the price. However this laptop far exceeded my expectations when I bought it for college I only use Malwarebytes and Microsoft Security Essentials run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years. For which is as much as my graphics card alone cost this laptop is an incredible value. It is quite impressive at multitasking which really surprised me. I can have tabs open while playing YouTube videos and it handles it impressively well. BUT I should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen it s certainly good enough for the average person but if you re used to good screens this may bother you a bit but it s certainly not unbearable by anyone s standards. If you want to game this thing can handle League of Legends on mediumlow settings but I certainly wouldn t recommend it for gaming. Overall a great laptop for simply doing basic things and webbrowsing. Would definitely recommend for those who are technologically ignorant this computer is very slow I love this laptop It does everything I need it too Very good price. Very nice computer Immediately didn t like the track buttons. They are loud and clunky but I figured I d get used to it. The laptop died two days after I received it. I purchased a Dell Inspiron and so far I love it this model has a true life monitor which is worth the extra bucks. If you re looking for a basic PC this is the way to go. The hinges on this PC are nice and tight and well made like the rest of the PC. I was surprised at the overall quality and the price In all my life i have never come across a computer as slow as this one it cant perform basic operations and is practically useless. I just received the laptop and if it runs like this already cant imagine how it would work in the next couple of weeks. It took almost minutes to boot up. Please people dont make the same mistake i did. This is a complete waste of money dont let the price fool you Would be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly. It was not responsive at all to touch. And while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse. If they can fix this I think it would be a very nice costeffective laptop. This laptop broke within the first hour of use. The A key became jammed so that sometimes it wouldn t press in. Dell claims they test each key with thousands of mechanical key strokes. Also after restarting the laptop it constantly made high pitched electronic noises. I m sure I just got a bad egg but instead of getting a replacement I decided to try a different one. This laptop is nice. It has a decent feel to it sharp display and is fast enough. The biggest problem I have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive. I have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available but nothing has helped. Also the touchpad is almost sticky which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad. I would love to keep this laptop but will be sending it back and looking for a different brand. No Lenovo for me. Initially I liked the product so much. Although it was slow but I felt it was ok for the price you have bought it. But now I am having battery problems. Laptop automatically shuts down when battery life reaches . I am not satisfied with the product. It s an amazing laptop. Most of the things about the laptop is awesome except the touchpad. The laptop is fast. The Windows used to boot in just and that was freaking awesome. Now I have dual booted my laptop to Windows and Ubuntu and it s not got too slow either. I am loving it completely. It does make a little noise but that s alright as it s not too much. It doesn t get heated up much even after continuous usage. But the touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever I am typing my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it s really annoying. I prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else. A smaller touchpad would make life easier for Computer Science students or IT people much more easier. Uhhhhhh the computer looks good. But it works really slowwwwww It has got me feel like to take years to successfully open a web page. Purchased it for my birthday and love it I m so glad that I have. It s been a very easy transition moving my Windows created files over to the Mac. So far I haven t lost any quality or information. I have a little bit of a learning curve with the keyboard shortcuts. But other than that I really am loving the quality and speed. Expensive but worth it. The display has a great resolution but have difficulty always seeing the small print. Haven t quite figured out how to make the font size larger overall. This is without a doubt the worst laptop I ve ever had. And of course the return window closed last week so now I m stuck with it. I will never buy another Lenovo anything Unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop don t buy this. The touchpad hasn t worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning I thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads I ve worked with have some inherent oddities. This one however is now very loose and I have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work Then suddenly I can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own. Today it hasn t worked at all more than it has. It hangs freezes and just isn t working properly. I have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open Though I don t have much installed I only have of the left I have no idea what s taking up all the room it doesn t make sense. I could go on and on but suffice it to say if you want to spend on a laptop don t buy this one It s definitely not worth the money. Very fast and good for most steam games. Don t expect great graphics though. The keyboard and sound are great and the matte screen works well. Can run CS GO at fps on low settings. Computer was DOA. Turned it on and it was beeping. I love this laptop. Looks good well built and very good speed. Needed a usb adapt. for network plug no problem. Keyboard is nice and windows is great worried about that coming from xp. Price makes this the laptop I was looking for. So far I am very happy with this computer. It has everything I wanted built in WiFi connectibility a slot for my SD camera memory card a DVD burner big beautiful screen plenty of USB ports three and one and a keyboard with a nice touch. I liked the fact that it came with Windows but also included Windows to install later if I need it. The price was good. I use a wireless mouse but the touch pad and the red button in the middle that works like a little joystick also work fine. I wish I had bought this sooner This is a great bargain. Yes it s running and old type processor so hey don t even try gaming on it. But if you are just an average user it works really great. The screen is good the whole things is very light and doesn t run hot. I m very happy with it typing on it right now and it is fast enough for that I like everything about this laptop. It has no way of connecting to the internet save wifi but that s all I use anyway I put that free app on for word processing and it works like a charm. I plugged it into my existing printers and it just worked no fuss no muss. It immediately recognized the printer and was ready to go. Excellent buy. The worst computer I have ever laid my eyes upon. Firstly it has no leds to let you know what is going on no cap lock no hard drive indicator nothing. Ok one light to let you know if the damn thing is on. The biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it even when the strength bar is filled. Also when you try to download a large file like a video it will start out normally downloading at around and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless. Too often I would find it not being able to stay connected to the internet. I was unable to download iTunes to it. Dell support was awful to deal with. And the settings are simply annoying. Just not for me. The computer is as expected and worth the money. The windows is a major disappointment. Operating a non touch screen on this system is a royal pain It came with no instruction book no back up CD s and has already crashed. Hands down one of my best and most used purchases thus far. The MacBook Pro does no disappoint... Retina screen solid build quality weight fast processor and the reliability of the Apple brand. Cons Honestly zero con s ... as a Windows PC user the switch over was seamlessly I run Parallel when I need Windows. All my devices work flawlessly. I m an amature so this does more than I can handle. I m perfectly satisfied just have to get use to the new system I can t see a problem. I fine now and happy as a bug. The price is great and it does everything I want to do Thanks. It s perfect It s great for what he uses it for. I am really not happy with this computer... I don t like WINDOWS but that is no fault of the computer but the keyboard is so hard to get the keys to work and the space bar. Would not buy it again. Meh...but cheap. The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus. Now the graphics are not HD...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic medium low grade plastic. So if you don t have kids or not in high school or don t accidently sit on it it should be fine. Now the speed is disappointing. Start up is fine maybe secs at most but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times. Even for a RAM it barely chugs with tabs open. All in all I wish I had waited a bit. This laptop is amazing Windows has its pros and cons. The keyboard is backlit but you have to press the key to turn it on. Of course this will decrease your battery life. The sound is very nice and crisp. Also I have no regrets about going with the RAM because its super fast. I m still exploring the various features but overall I am satisfied with my purchase. The HP Envy has been everything I expected. After doing much research for a laptop that had all the features I was looking for This one hit all the criteria I had. The laptop is very responsice with the Core processor and of RAM and the sound out of the Beats audio is great. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a top performing laptop. used times black screen returned for refund do not use the facial recognition Windows is not supported by a lot of things The Dell is quick enough sturdy not good with finger prints. It does what it advertises. Price is great wish it didn t have Windows but that is an opinion. I would recommend it for anybody needing a reliable simple laptop. I bought this for my daughter to use for school and homework it s not a fast computer but it s great for what she needs it for and very light weight Love the price too Well my first apple computer and I am impressed. Works well fast and no reboots. Glad I did so far. s.... L .... o..... w.... rea......llllyy slow. like seriously really slow. impossible to use. cant even read properly. plus no russian input wtf What a great laptop I can run my games and work really fast. Really light you can carry with you everywhere. Great battery life. Everything at a very great price. I completely recommend it. Excellent value and a must buy for someone looking for a Macbook. You can t get any better than this price and it come with an internal disk drive. Plus you get which is also a great feature. Also the resale value on this will keep. I highly recommend you get one before they are gone. Got this on black friday with a very good discount and couldn t be happier. The screen is great I don t see the need for a retina display. I also really like the addition of the SD Card slot. This Macbook Pro is AMAZING If you are afraid of it not having a disc player please don t be. I love the new high retina display and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter. Overall this is a fast light practical computer and I highly recommend it. I bought my Macbook Pro in October of and years later it still works as flawless as ever I ve never had any problems with the computer itself The Macbook charger chords are another story though . I tried not to jump on the Apple bandwagon but... you re just living in denial if you don t. Happy buying Bought this laptop from best buy in January still loving it. I can use it as a tablet as a laptop as whatever I want to I play Sims and on it all the time with very little issues. The thing wakes up super fast and is always ready to go. Music/videos sound great and look great. I use it everyday. My favorite computer I ve ever had This computer overall is great it runs fast ships fast etc. but the company and seller lied to you and try to make an extra buck I bought this pc to play games and stream movies it could handle all of that but my friend wanted me to put some music on a cd I could see the disk drive on the side but it didn t seem to have a button on it A DISK DRIVE WITH BUTTONS ON IT And he said&quot; this computer does not have a disk drive and I was furious So beware buyer this computer has a useless piece of plastic on it. Thank you asus. they don t deserve to be capitalized Great computer. Very great Apple product as expected. Good battery life. Great color on screen. Good speakers from laptop computer. My new laptop is great. It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp. I have to admit that the operating system is different and does take time to learn but I like it. I would recommend it to anyone. This laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing. The speakers are fairly basic so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies. The touchpad is a little &quot;clunky&quot; for my taste; I use a small external mouse with laptops in any event. I appreciate the relatively large keyboard with number pad and screen size. I also found the track pad irritating until I disabled &quot;pinch zoom.&quot; This is larger laptop but is not too heavy. Battery life is great though it is new. Overall a solid laptop for its price. However a few things are immediately occurring to me I had read the other reviews here on amazon but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead. Well my first impressions are that its OK it certainly boots up quickly thanks SSD and from the limited use so far no games its fast enough in normal usage. It certainly looks nice but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out. Also I have found the touch pad to be awkward to use could be I am pressing too hard perhaps and the screen is well underwhelming. To be honest I am a little disappointed and considering returning it. This is a horrible laptop. Within a day of usage it already slowed down significantly virus entered the system right away. It s heavy. I regretted immediately. Nothing like the description says. My Apple mac book pro has crashed three times since I purchased it. Each time Apple can only uninstall to original factory settings for me to start over. I believe this MacBook Pro was a lemon right out the gate. This computer is like... I m lost for words. This is the best switch I have ever done. This has much more memory and ram memory. Even the battery life is like WOW I love LOVE LOOOOVE I can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied. It contains a long battery life incredible specs and an overall enjoyable performance. Upgrading from a toshiba laptop I am fully impressed with all of the benefits that the mac operating system provides. The snappy processor allows for me to quickly upload photos and videos as well as create movies for me and my colleagues to enjoy. In upgrading to this computer I can say I have found little to any flaws in the product hence the star review. Love this computer. It has done everything and more that I expected. I am sure it will be able to do all I need it to do in the future as well. The screen looks great in my opinion the sound is nice. So far I have no complaints and dont expect many complaints in the future. This did give some set trouble and i had to call tech support. They were great. its been easy breezy since then. how could you not love a Mac so far so good i have not encountered any issues with this computer. love the flip feature and the touch screen feature. for the price that i paid i feel that i got good value. this lap top is not the lightest you can purchase so if that is important to you maybe you should shop some more. To a prospective buyer Once you go Mac you ll never go back. Was the best decision we ever made. It runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems We don t have to defrag deliete cookies run security programs or any of the common PC problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed. You can t get a virus on Mac so in the long run the cost of the Mac is saved by not buying security and not having to replace your computer every year or two. Never had any issues no frustrations just great easy wireless all in one fun It s great. because it is a touch screen you don t even need a mouse. You will probably never use it in tablet mode but it s nice to know you have that option. If you draw on the other hand i m sure you will love using this in tablet mode. Lastly because it can flip you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard. This computer is great. I have a GB SSD and GB of RAM in it which I installed myself. It runs faster than it did when I got it. I enjoy the simplicity and userfriendly interface of Yosemite. I m excited for El Capitan. The apps are very easy to use. The resolution is excellent. I am very satisfied with EVERYTHING about this machine. Like so many others who do this there is a learning curve and I m excited to do it. This MBP is clean neat and simple. I like that. It takes less time to power up and if you just close the case it go into sleep mode. WHen you open it wakes up almost immediately. Very nice. I am pleased with my decision however I have only had this for a few weeks. There are a few things I am dissappointed with though. Only USB ports. No HDMI port. The headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone. Not a big deal for me but if you Skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a Mac. As a student majoring computer science I really fell in love with this laptop. It s inches which for me is not too big nor too small. It has the latest CPU with a GTX for GPU which makes this laptop blazing fast boots up in under seconds with the help of the SSD of course . It has SSD which is just enough for my OS games documents and anything in between. It also has an extra bay for an extra HDD if you wish to add one. It s not touchscreen Its keyboard is nicely arranged silent and backlit which is nice but what I don t like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers. I have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good. This laptop is so silent its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load thanks to the generation Intel core which draws less power thus less heat. It can run games really well. Well not really well. MOBAs like Dota and SMITE can be run on max quality settings with fps or more. Medium settings on titles like Tomb Raider for it to be acceptable fps is the minimum acceptable fps #pcmasterrace . It s lightweight and easy to carry around. The screen is a matte display which is nice but with poor viewing angle. I find myself adjusting it regularly. It looks sleek and gorgeous. Blends in with any accessory you use with it. All in all I am very happy with this purchase. And with this price I don t think you can buy anything better. All I can say is I am impressed. Very quick to get it up and running with a minimum setup time right after you open the box. It s worth it. Pay me now Pay me later.........I am happy with my choice going with this laptop. I was disappointed. It seemed like a great computer and a great deal. The first one arrived and it did not work. The space bar sticks. I find it hard to navigate from screen to screen. For a noncomputer savvy person it was very disappointing. I like the inch macbooks. Its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable. The new Mac OS Mountain Lion has some nice features as wel as the trackpad. I didn t think i would need an optical drive but since i have had it I used it several times. The magnetic lid and charger is cool and battery indicator on the side is cool. The mac is light and so compact I thought I would regret not buying a retina display not in the least The mac pro works just fine. The OS is easy and offers all kinds of surprises. I ve been using Apple s since and this is the fastest and best one I ve had. This Mac allows all of that. This is very fast high performance computer. This should be more than enough computer for almost everyone. I would not hesitate recommending this to anyone. It fast and easy to set up. I had cloned my data from my old computer using Carbon Copy Cloner CCC and simply moved everything to the new computer and was off and running at speeds I had only dreamed up before. The Mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized lazy and eye candy person in all of us. The MacBook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like a friendly guide. If you want to use the Internet then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon. This computer is amazing for the individual who does not want to do any extra work via their understanding of their laptop. I would ve given stars had it not been for the hours of updates I ve had to do to this upon arrival. Other than that I love it. It s portable reliable and great for what I use it for. Positives No matter what position this laptop will stay in it. It s very sturdy. Quick bootup and runs efficiently. Touchscreen is great. Negatives As aforementioned my only con was the updates. Everything you d expect from a Mac. It looks and feels solid with a flawless finish. The screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down. Only had it a few weeks but doesn t leave my side. This machine is flawless fast and classy. Out of all the laptops I have owned this is by far the best I m not sure if it was covered in the description but it does have a backlit keyboard and I m getting about an hour battery life on one charge Except I don t use this for games or videos which obviously would drain the battery faster . It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid. The screen has an extremely high resolution that I m very pleased with. Even though MacBooks are expensive you will see that they are well worth the money. You will not regret buying this computer My daughter s MacBook Air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago. It took days to make an appointment at the local Apple store. I m not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand for a new battery to replace it and for a new keyboard. I could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple store myself and asked for a manager. He explained to me the battery expansion is normal . Apple doesn t cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care. The battery is simply considered consumable and NOT covered. I asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook Air on the internet with the description that Apple doesn t consider the product defective. His reply astonished me looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear He didn t specify who are they but from the tone of his voice and his posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS. Here is my take on all of this the business model Apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from China hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school call them geniuses and bully everybody who complains about their product. Steve Jobs is dead so is Apple. No more Apple devices in my household. Please Google MacBook battery bulge explode before you buy your next Apple toy. I ve been spoiled by the build quality and stability of Macintosh and even this used computer is a gem. I can bat around all the things that everyone else says but it s been what we ve been using for decades and I have nothing bad to say. It churns out HD content runs without many flaws and I ve yet to get a virus on a Mac since I started using the platform in the early s. My MacBook s motherboard fried but I think that was a sugar spill that I never bothered cleaning up. That s the only issue I ve ever had since working on Macs in That s a pretty impressive track record don t you think However the HP Envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more. I have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all. While the price may seem high it is worth every penny with its many perks. The Pros A Ton of Storage Space This laptop comes with of memory and a TB hard drive. That is plenty of space for your laptop which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers. Capability The ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus. If you are looking to get a laptop this is the laptop you should consider. I love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies without having the keyboard in the way of things. I find it much easier to type on and much more durable. Battery Life My battery life is really good with this laptop and I have had no problems with it thus far. I can usually go about hours before I get down to battery life. The Cons No Disc Drive Call me old fashioned but I still enjoy listening to physical CDs and uploading them to iTunes. However I can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive. Overall I definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop. The touchscreen and capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes. It also is nice to be able to play Candy Crush or Angry Birds when in between classes straight from your laptop. It makes it much more exciting to play I m actually writing this review on my new MacBook and I love it The computer it self is amazing. It is an older model so know that upfront but it is everything I was looking for. From the moment I received this MacBook it was like a dream come true. I know once I upgrade the ram to it will pick up a lot. Also if after reading some reviews and doing some research I found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus. So long story short if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop. I know people were complaining that it isn t the newest model but it all depends on what you are looking for. I highly recommend This computer is a fantastic tool for word processing searching the internet and keeping track of everyday life. It s also incredibly light has a battery that can last for days and looks like a piece of art. Though that s pretty much what your paying for a well designed device. When you look at the internal specs the computer is only worth about It has a GB storage capacity but with the option of a GB hard drive and a dualcore Intel Core so don t expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too. If your looking to be a trendy hipster who can t live without a Mac it s a great buy. It mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don t need. Pros Nice Looks. Keyboard is great I wanted a simple Full HD display and this one does its job Sound is great And this has a extra slot for HDD No CD drive. Cons Web cam. VGA really ASUS You don t want to show this to anyone . Anyway I don t use webcam much so I don t care Viewing angles are not great. Remember its a dual core. The fan kicks in even its not too hot. I found the track pad not great. I use my mouse so not a problem for me. Over all very good system and worth it. This was the ONLY tabletstyle computer so far which met my requirements. I was seduced by this computer so I took it home. The wireless keyboard not bluetooth but RF did not pair up with the device. It still did not pair. I even ran it as Administrator still no effect. I used the CtrlEsc keys while turning on and still nothing. It flickers briefly to green before the light goes out. I still can t pair it. I don t want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional. Sony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while I get my money back for a DEFECTIVE product. But Sony doesn t seem to have addressed it. My first Mac computer and as many before me I just fall in love with it. Changed the memory from GB to GB Corsair Vengeance and GB HDD rpm with Seagate hybride GB HDD SSD. Machine is flying and with parallels desktop I have my old PC notebook completely functional on my MBP. Way to go and enjoy both worlds. This ASUS you re looking at right here and that I m typing on right now has one. With that being said for the price you get a nice fast laptop but if you ask me it s missing some things that I feel should be automatically included This laptop has no Touchscreen Optical Drives OK a bit of a stretch because that would eat up precious space in this monster Swivel or detachable screen What this laptop does have is Windows which is confusing as all getout Tons of This is really nice but I HATE the awkward right mouse clicking.. sometimes it works sometimes it doesn t.. may be the laptop may be the laptop in conjunction with Windows Either way highly annoying. I hooked up a USB mouse and all is well. All works beautifully but Windows is taking a bit of getting used to. Love the degree rotation and the touch screen works great but a little bit of a learning curve there too as sometimes I have to tap a few times to get the exact location I need... overall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop the mouse was the only negative I could really see ... This is a fantastic transformer I loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows platform. The only reason I returned it was because I bought it to use the touchscreen with photoshop and because of the program it could not utilize the touchscreen within the work space except to zoom and rotate. I would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase. It s a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen. I m looking forward to needing a laptop update so I can purchase this computer again. I ve only had this for a week Overall I like the computer it s thin &amp; light and The wireless keyboard works great. I was impressed; Sony puts in small touches like a USB charging port on the charger. One thing I did t like is the stylus holder it s cheap plastic and doesn t seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the USB port. I do t use it I think I would accidently break it and loose my stylus. The other Issue I had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it. Awesome laptop for college Can be used for gaming as well. It s light fast and has great battery It s a steal when considering the specs and performance as well. The processor and GPU are fantastic at running games and multiple apps. I can run most games to a good quality without seeing any lack of speed. The backlit keyboard is a nice touch especially. Make sure to only handle this computer with clean hands because the front cover can get oily pretty fast. I m overall very pleased with my new laptop The only downside are the speakers. They don t go very loud at all. The quality of the sound is nice but the lack of volume really kills it for me. This is mostly not an issue since I mainly use earbuds anyways however it could be annoying at times. The screen looked fine to me and wasn t an issue like others have been saying. Overall great for me This laptop has delivered. I immediately did the Windows upgrade and haven t had any issues. The wireless adapter is strong and the SSD is fast. This thing boots in just a few seconds which is nice. Others have mentioned issues with viewing angle on the screen but I never use the laptop where I m not looking straight at it so it doesn t bother me. I m very pleased with the purchase. Boot time is super fast around anywhere from seconds to minute. Apps launch super fast and the HDD is more than sufficient. I usually use my Mac for school work and internet browsing so the entrylevel MacBook Pro is already more than what I expected from a computer I would typically use it for. Macs hardly ever get viruses and they are completely incompatible with existing Microsoft Windows Viruses. Furthermore Mac OS X Mountain Lion s Gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed. The keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are backlit which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing Typing . Overall the screen resolution though nonretina is sufficient for normal web browsing and work. The thunderbolt port is awesome US comes with the MBP and has transfer rates of up to Other ports include FireWire Gigabit Ethernet MagSafe port Microphone jack. SDHC card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs. The glass track pad is large enough for Apple s highly acclaimed multitouch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers. For Windows users switching to a Mac you can also enable right clicking known to apple as secondary click in the system preferences&gt; Mouse and enabling right clicking. The unique to apple aluminium unibody is a real beauty. It makes the MBP very durable and protects it from scratches though you shouldn t go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it. The Mac app store and iTunes store are phenomenal. The Mac app store is your onestop shop for Mac software though you can also download software online at your own risk. There are currently around apps on the App store and counting... and billions of songs available for download fro the iTunes store. iTunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it s simple to use User Interface. I m sure you won t regret making this purchase. One of the worst pieces of electronics I have ever bought. Very pour performance. It takes for ever to wake it up. Sometimes It stops receiving wifi signal so I have to restart it. It is very slow and not responsive. Would not recommend. Glare is also pretty frustrating. There is definitely more to say... I tested it it worked great. He received it and one day later it DIES. The laptop refuses to start we have troubleshooted all areas still fails to start. Cannot even get to bios. Just a click and a BLACK SCREEN. Of course it DIES days past the return window. We got two days of operation from this laptop. When the MacBook Pro arrived I helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the PC to the Mac... an easy draganddrop process utilizing a flash drive. It was delivered with of RAM on each of two sticks which was probably adequate. So I simply pulled one stick from the machine and installed the stick in its place. The machine now has gigs of RAM and it works just fine. But hey it s an Apple. I wouldn t expect anything less If it was possible to give them start I would have done it. My Laptop s one of the Key from keyboard came out and it was mechanical failure. My laptop was under coverage but when I gave it to them for repairs they quoted me for it. this company just wants customers money in their pocket. they dont care how you feel when they charge you hundreds of hard earned dollars. I wish this company to go bust. I will never ever buy any apple product in my life. Overall I love it. First when I move the screen to put it in tablet position the hinge doesn t seem totally solid. I feel like I need to be really gentle with it but maybe that s just me. Also and this maybe is another personal quirk but the keyboard sits a little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop. First off AMAZING LAPTOP Three years ago I had purchased this bad boy and it still runs great If I were to have any technical difficulties the local apple and contact line were able to help me asap it was quite impressive. I myself had purchased the gig drive laptop and as a DJ with thousands of songs pictures and other things...and after years I have managed to fill around of my gigs. There is SO MUCH ROOM Pros Amazing storage both and gig ram needed if you are as productive as I am DJ photography movie making etc its quick No anti spyware needed never had a virus and I never will build solid and durable bought the year warranty and boy it was needed because of my doings Cons. If you fall behind in updates your laptop will become progressively slower just update it...then its back to normal Sometimes when I stared mine up it would take a few extra minutes to boot on other times it is a few seconds Cannot manually take battery out unless you work for apple or have the tools Overall it is a fantastic laptop. Mine has been though hundreds of parties weddings quinces anything involving performances it can take it This laptop was made for art music beatmaking pictures movies graphic design. By the way it comes with apps and hardware that can already support what I had just listed. This laptop will last you a half decade if not a full decade. Soon I will be hitting the year mark and I think this thing can make it another in my opinion. Get this now By the way...I paid for this particular laptop roughly grand...LOOK AT THE PRICE NOW This is a great laptop. I bought it for college and couldn t be happier. The SSD and complement each other really well. I was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows but it is pretty awesome. If you are looking for a light durable and extremely effecient laptop buy this one They really know what they are doing. The laptop is so easy to work with. Like it was designed for what people would want to the system to do very userfriendly. Its simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great aside from its quality design and sexy looks. If you dont like windows I would suggest trying a Mac. The investment is worth it. Have bought several laptops in last several years and hands down this has been the best ever. Mac User interface is just the best. Also the laptop is quite no more burnt laps best screen display and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over. Only thing I dislike is that everything for Mac is expensive but I guess you pay for quality Not impressed with Macintosh products. In fact I am completely frustrated. Also many software programs are not compatible with the IOS platform. Be sure the programs you need will work on a MAC before you buy one I had heard people speak highly of the MacBook Pro for college students and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use. The MacBook Pro is useful for college students for many reasons It is the cheapest product in the line of MacBook s The new operating system called Snow Leopard is installed and ready for use The battery life has increased from the last version from hours to hours making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger. Reliability Throughout the past few years I have had no problems with the MacBook Pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws. Durability My computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it. Usability The MacBook Pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who doesn t necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers. The processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly. The MacBook Pro has a significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes Pros o It usually runs very smoothly but Apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers. o It has an extended battery life. o It is extremely user friendly. Cons o Some people don t enjoy the way the processing system runs but don t have any issues with getting it to function. o Others have problems with the applications depending what they need to use the device for for example engineering majors need extra applications &amp; systems to do some work but they are easily downloadable. My first laptop ever and it is a flips into a tablet mode also brilliant. So far so good. Battery doesn t hold up to what it said in the description but I got it refurb d and I imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price Just a guess . Still getting used to typing on it my palms keep hitting the mousepad and causing the cursor to jump and moving me off of where I was typing. Plenty of ports and since this is my first laptop I really don t have anything to compare it to. Note no DVD drive no Ethernet port Screen is too small to read and almost impossible to touch with a normal adult finger. The brightest screen setting appeared dim in normal room light. Keyboard is flimsy and mediocre at best. The touch pad feel is a on scale Computer seemed sluggish for an Intel Core device. Power on good luck finding it. I would run back to computer store and return this expensive toy. signed not impressed I bought this a few months ago and it s holding up fairly well. Runs fast the touch screen hasn t lost any sensitivity I m overall very happy with it. This one doesn t do that. The trackpad is pretty crappy but aren t they all This is my first Apple computer and I couldn t be more pleased. IOS does everything its billed to do and much much more. Literally every detail has been thought out and designed with the user in mind. I can t believe how much time it saves me through automatic processes. The computer of the people I love this laptop. The batter lasts as long as claimed. I get about or so hours playing the sims. I haven t really officially tested it yet but it s a long time. I hate plugging my laptop in because I don t want to leave it on too long and hurt the battery but with this laptop I rarely have to charge it. The touchscreen is responsive and even works with my crappy dollar stylus. The only problem I have is with windows I hate windows It made me sign up with Microsoft and sometimes won t let me download things that are harmful to my computer but that s what anti virus software is for lol. The wifi rumor hasn t happened to me. The wifi works great. It feels very well built. The metal is very expensive feeling. The laptop is a little more than an inch thick when closed. I m a very weak girl and I could lift this laptop with one hand however I d get tired soon lol. The screen is not good for carrying around in your bare hands. I bought my first MacBook exactly months ago and was really happy with my new toy but what was not my surprise when I turned it on days ago and the screen was completely black. I can hear the noise of the computer turning on and the lights also turn on but the screen in completely dead. The best computer I ve ever bought. The simple look of icons and format makes it easy to navigate through programs and download files. The only issue I had was with the harddrive. The harddrive crashed and I thought I had lost the whole computer. Replacing the harddrive in this laptop is extremely easy a couple screws on the back to remove the backplate and the harddrive is pretty much plug and play. And apple was happy to install the latest osx for free You wont be disappointed with this computer It s just a matter of getting used to the touchpad commands. Thankfully I have earphones and an external amplifier for audio; the onboard speakers are just terrible. But what should I expect from a unit that is this thin and this light The most disappointing purchase of my life I received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after I purchased this horrible machine. Within the first few months that I bought it there was clearly a problem with the hard drive. The online customer service was awful. Gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile. No one would ever answer my question as to why I couldn t get another new Macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my Macbook was still under warranty. As a matter of fact no matter how many times I asked that question the employees I spoke purposely ignored it. They didn t say yes and they didn t say no they just pretended that I never asked it which was incredibly frustrating. I ve been to the bar several times they have been very nice . They have now basically replaced everything inside my machine told me there was a problem with the hardware so I now have a machine. Maybe I m not being reasonable but I don t feel that s the same as a new computer because I didn t pay for a refurbished computer. I still have weird freezing problems with it and it s pretty slow but it s not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in. I had delusions of grandeur regarding Apple s customer and the of their etc.. etc...blah...blah... I m sure most people s Macbooks work just fine but FYI if you get the factory dud you re stuck with it and no one at Apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away. One OS for this platform no OEM OS paraphernalia and automatic updates. I am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the MAC Well she was right Whatever in the world took me so long to get a computer that just works. I m no power user but I have had no learning curve with the MAC and I don t do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the OS. I did buy Office for the MAC at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for and that was a steal in my opinion. Otherwise I am happily a Mac user. For a premium laptop sold in the Apple MacBook Pro inch base model is about as basic as it gets no SSD no discrete graphics no display and no touch screen. But Apple does not pretend it has any of these. What it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side Apple s OSX Mountain Lion the sleek looks Apple always delivers reasonable specs good battery life nice keyboard and excellent trackpad. Those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs. The MacBook Pro inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution. This Mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair. Hard drives can be replaced RAM can be added as needed and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge. This added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money detracts from the computer s value. Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a fivestar purchase but for the price this is a four star good computer. TLDR version good reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive. I am really sorry I bought this machine. I was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase. This machine has made me go there times and has been nothing but a continuous problem. Finally they are sending it in for a motherboard replacement. It s a lemon . So I m cooled on Mac buys. They did not replace the motherboard. Instead they tightened a loose wire. It also has a big new scratch on the top cover. I started it up and it still has the same problem I went in to fix. So I m going back to Genius Bar for visit I think it may have to be Apple Don t Care instead of Apple Care. You get what you pay for right Mac is complicated and frustrating at moments. I watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough. I should have known better. I hope you don t make the same mistake... When I first got the computer I noticed the tracking pad was hard to click. I took my Macbook to the Apple store and they had to replace the battery after month of use since it was swelling. They tried to tell me that the battery wasn t covered by the warranty and it costs about to replace. They ended up not charging me. Other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long I m pretty happy with the computer. I m a designer turned frontend developer and this computer is unusable for frontend development. Opening photoshop takes FOooooooRRREVER as do all programs that do not begin with an i . The free upgrade to Mountain Lion FAILED. It tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again. Before and after I resolved that issue I saw the damn beachball all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell it s doing while I wait for it. I spend so much time waiting for it. I can t believe people like these computers. Now that they are not virus free ... l I see absolutely no benefit to Apple products as they are slower more expensive and do not last as long. Don t waste your money. My HP seemed great at first then the problems started.....wireless adapter would just &quot;disappear&quot; and the system said it didn t have a network card. Sometimes it comes back sometimes not. HP was NO help. The lettering wore off the keys so you better be able to type blind. The battery lasted months then pffft.....gone. When I had a boot up issue the HP recovery didn t work. The disks I made wouldn t work.....HP support stated &quot;we re a hardware company not a software company.&quot; Then there was a power cord recall....HP never notified us.....and we did register......never again. I don t have the inclination or time to devote to a companies tech support search functions or hold times.....dropped the HP and never looked back. I gave this product stars because I have been looking for a MacBook Pro for a long time and I found it here for a wonderful price. I have used this product for only days but I can t wait to use it more. I really like Mac/Apple products because of their operating system. I can tweet and use Facebook from the sidebar which is really nice. I also like I have the option to push calendars photos and contacts to an iPad iPod Touch or iPhone if I had any of those . The only thing I have had trouble with so far is transferring music to iTunes which I would have liked to do though I used iTunes on a computer separate from my Linux computer but I could not figure that out. I just ended up using my iPod to transfer my iTunes music and I redownloaded my Amazon music losing my ratings . I have not tried gaming on it but I have heard that Mac/Apple does not do games well. I plan on using my MacBook Pro for a long time. When I decided to buy my first computer I wish I had bought a Mac first. If the price doesn t deter you you ll find it well worth it in terms of troublefree operation. I ve had it for more than a year and I ve found that no antivirus software is needed as long as you don t download anything without being sure that it s from a legitimate source. From time to time I get the spinning beach ball that holds up progress. I can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the Show all bookmarks icon the open book icon at the upper left . Once in a long while that doesn t work; in that case I turn the computer off then on again and sign in problem solved. I ll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself and just conclude by saying that I m delighted with my purchase. Received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed. To go left I have to go right and vice versa and to go up I have to go down. When I attach a mouse it s fine but the touchpad is really annoying. I went through the settings and there isn t a way to fix it. It s a great laptop but right now it s annoying to use the touchpad.'"

इस्तेमाल करने और उसके लिए भुगतान करने के पूरे काम का मेन प्वॉइंट है और यह बताते हुए मुझे बहुत खुशी हो रही है कि इसका अनुभव बहुत ही अच्छा है । एमबीपीएस वार्इफार्इ कनेक्शन पर स्ट्रीमिंग बहुत सही होता है

एप व्हाट्सएप के एकीकरण के लिए टेस्टिंग की प्रक्रिया का आरम्भ कर दिया है । फेसबुक ने एक नए बटन के तौर पर सेंड बटन को इस प्रक्रिया में शामिल किया है । बताया जा रहा है कि फेसबुक के इस एंड्राइड एप के नए

मैप्स पर चलती है । हालांकि बड़ी स्क्रीन वाला फोन इस सर्विस के लिए अच्छा है । इसलिए इसका मतलब है कि यह सही मायनों में लाइव सूचना की सुविधा नहीं देती है । हालांकि एप्प तेज काम करता दिखता है लेकिन इसमें कुछ गंभीर प्रकार के फीचरों के सेट की कमी है जैसे कि मल्टीपल एकाउंट । सबसे पहले अब गूगल ड्राइव एप्पलीकेशन यूजर्स को एप्पीलेकशन के अंदर अपने आप से सीधे ही स्प्रेडशीट को संपादन करने की सुविधा देगा । इसके अतिरिक्त अपग्रेड शानदार टेक्स्ट फार्मेटिंग लाय़ा है जबकि वे गूगल डॉक्यूमेंट में कॉपी और पेस्ट कर सकते हैं । एप्लिकेशन में आईकान को बेहद ही सहज तरीके से पेश किया गया है । इसमें आप अपनी सुविधनुसार बदलाव भी कर सकते हैं । म्यूजिक के मामले में तो आपको बहुत कुछ मिलेगा । इन सब में से एक्शन गेम्स सबसे अधिक पसंदीदा और मजेदार माने जाते हैं । यह ऑफ़लाइन काम करता है । यह सीमित उपयोग का है । इसे शुरू करने के लिए आपको सिर्फ यह करना है कि इसके ऑपशन्स टैब पर जा कर भाषा चुननी है जो दरअसल बहुत सारी मौजूद हैं । यह एप्पलीकेशन अंतरराष्ट्रीय भाषाओं को सपोर्ट करती है । इसके बाद कॉन्टेक्ट के लिए स्टोरेज चुनें जो गूगल या डिवाइस में से कोई एक होगी इसके साथ ही एप्पलीकेशन की सेटअप का हिस्सा पूरा हो जाता है । गेम की एक कमी यह है कि यह सिर्फ एक ही ग्राफिक मोड में आता है । यह एक ऑफबीट टॉवर डिफेंस गेम है जिसमें आप घंटों मजा ले सकते हैं । एंड्रॉयड पॉइंट और उससे ऊपर के प्लैटफॉर्म पर ही चलता है । इस गेम के लिए न्यूनतम ग्राफिक्स की जरूरत होती है । यह गेम मुफ्त में उपलब्ध है और प्लेयर्स को इस गेम को खेलने में कोई पैसे खर्च नहीं करने पड़ते हैं । हाई परफॉर्मेंस डिवाइस पर ही चलता है । रोल प्लेइंग गेम्स यानी आरपीजी एंड्रॉयड पर काफी पॉपुलर हो चुके हैं । डिवाइस की ग्राफिक और प्रॉसेसिंग क्वॉलिटी में बढ़ोतरी होने के साथ ही पहले से ज्यादा घातक और ग्राफिक गेम्स आ चुके हैं । दौड़ें भागें कूदें और रोल करें लेकिन ध्यान रहे आपकी टाइमिंग बिल्कुल सही होनी चाहिए । लो एंड डिवाइस में भी चलने योग्य है । ऐप स्टोर से फ्री मिलता है । इस गेम को आप ठीक तरह से खेल पाएं इसमें कुछ वक्त लगता है । हो सकता है शुरू में आपको ऐसा महसूस हो कि आप खुद को मरता हुआ देखें । कॉलर की स्थिति की सूचना होने पर आप कभी अत्यावश्यक कॉल जिसकी आप अपेक्षा कर रहे थे कभी मिस नहीं करते हैं । ऑफलाइन होने पर काम करता है । नंबरों की मैन्युअल खोज उपलब्ध है । ये बहुत ही हल्का है तथा इसके डाटा आपकी डिवाइस में अंदरूनी रूप से स्टोर रहते है जिसके कारण आपको एक्टिव जीपीआरएस कनेक्शन इस एप्प को प्रयोग करने के लिए नहीं लेना पड़ता है । लेकिन यह उनके लिए बेहतर नहीं है जो सेलफोन के प्रयोग के द्वारा दूसरो की जासूसी करना चाहते है क्योंकि यह एप्प केवल इतना करता है कि यूजर के मोबाइल फोन के रजिस्ट्रेशन से जुड़ी जानकारी देता है एवं यूजर द्वारा प्रयोग किए जाने वाले सेल्युलर सेवादाता की जानकारी देता है । इस्तेमाल करने में आसान है । डिफॉल्ट ब्राउजर के साथ तालमेल बिठाने में आसान है । वजन में हल्का है । ओपेरा के साथ तालमेल में समस्या है । इस एप्लीकेशन का लेआउट काफी साफ है और डाउनलोड लिंक को सीधे एप्लीकेशन में पेस्ट करने की सुविधा है । जहां तक ब्राउजर की बात है तो मूल ब्राउजर के साथ तो यह काफी बढ़िया तरीके से काम करता है लेकिन ओपेरा जैसे ब्राउजर जिसमें इनबिल्ट डाउनलोड क्लाइंट होता है वहां टर्बो डाउनलोडर कुछ खास उपयोगी नहीं है । इसके अलावा किसी स्टेशन पर टिकट काउंटर पर भी ऐसा कर सकते है । रेलवे अधिकारी के मुताबिक यात्री ईवॉलेट को टॉप अप करने के लिए टिकट काउंटर पर या आईआरसीटीसी की वेबसाइट पर क्रेडिट या डेबिट कार्ड से भी कर सकते हैं । कंपनी ने अभी कुछ दिनों पहले एसफाल् एयरबॉर्न विंडो गेम भी विंडो डिवाइसेस के लिए पेश किया था । गेम में कई स् और अच् ग्राफिक दिए गए हैं । इसमें करीब लाइसेंस कार औश्र टैग के साथ रियल माजदा रेसवे लॉगुना सिका और लागुना सिका रेसवे कैलिफोर्निया के ट्रैक दिए गए हैं । जीबी रेसिंग गेम फ्री में गूगल प् से डाउनलोड किया जा सकता है । मजबूत बनावट और डिजाइन है । एफ मोटर आवाज करता है । व्यू फाइंडर में एफ पॉंइन्ट का न होना एक कमि है । पेन्टेक्स एक आकर्षक डीएसएलआर है । कई अच्छे फीचर्स के साथ इसकी इमेज की क्वालिटी भी बेहद अच्छी है । व्यू फाइंडर लगभग प्रतिशत रेंज कवरेज देता है । कम रौशनी या हाथ से तस्वीर लेते हुए संतुलन के साथ शार्प इमेज के लिए इसमें विशेष रूप से सेंसर शिफ्ट स्टैबिलाइजेशन दिया गया है । बनावट अगर देखें तो बाजार में इंट्री लेवल पर उपलब्ध अन्य डीएसएलआर के मुकाबले ज्यादा भारी है । कंट्रोल्स डायल्स और बटन्स बॉडी पर इस तरह फिट किए गए हैं कि आपको इनके प्रयोग में उलझन महसूस नहीं होती यहां तक कि अगर आप निकॉन या कैनन डीएसएलआर के यूजर हैं तो भी कंट्रोल्स के प्रयोग में आपको ज्यादा वक्त नहीं लगता । पीछे की तरफ इंच की एलसीडी और सेटिंग कंट्रोल के लिए साधारण बटन्स के साथ फोर वे पैड दिया गया है । रबर आईकैप के साथ व्यू फाइंडर बेहद आरामदायक बनाया गया है । एमएएच रिचार्जेबल लिथियम या एए बैटरी काफी अच्छा फीचर है । इंट्री लेवल के लिए अपने प्रतियोगियों के मुकाबले ज्यादा लाभकारी प्रीमियम नजर आता है । परफॉर्मेन्स की बात करें तो कई जगह काफी अच्छा काम करता है लेकिन अगर पेंटैक्स इसे इन्ट्री लेवल डीएसएलआर में सबसे अच्छा बनाना चाहती है तो कई सुधारों की गुंजाइश भी है । पिक्चर क्वालिटी रॉ और जेपीइजी तो प्रभावित करता है पर इसके अलावा भी एक बेहद लाभकारी फीचर इसमें है । वह यह कि रॉ फाइल्स को इसमें आप सेव कर सकते हैं और यह तब भी काम करता है जबकि आपने कैमरा में रॉ फॉर्मेट सेव का ऑप्शन सेट नहीं किया होता है । ऑटोफोकस फास्ट काम करता है लेकिन किट लेंस पर थोड़ा आवाज करता है । आवाज के अलावे इसमें एक और परेशनी यह है कि व्यू फाइंडर में ऑटो फोकस का फंक्शन नहीं दिया गया है । हालांकि अगर आपने एएफ ए या ऑटो पॉइन्ट सेलेक्शन सेट नहीं किया है तो एएफ पॉइन्ट्स के बीच शिफ्ट कर सकते हैं । स्पोर्टिंग इवेंट्स के लिए कभी कभी फोटोग्राफी का शौक रखने वालों के लिए ईजी टू यूज है । शौकिया फोटोग्राफी करने वालों के लिए इसमें कुछ प्री सेट्स फिल्टर्स और कलर मोड्स भी हैं । क्योंकि में पिक्चर आइएसओ पर लिए जाते हैं इसलिए इसकी तस्वीरें उच्च गुणवत्ता की होती हैं इनमें धुंधलापन नहीं होता । निकॉन और कैनन की तुलना में इसका तस्वीर संतुलन अच्छा है । पेंटैक्स डीएसएलआर शौकिया फोटोग्राफी के लिए अच्छे फीचर्स और अच्छी कीमत का कैमरा है । मजबूत बनावट और डिजाइन के साथ आइएसओ का बड़ा रेंज और एफपीएस ड्राइव मोटर इसकी खासियते हैं । एफ मोटर आवाज करता है इंटरफेस बहुत पुराने स्टाइल का है और व्यू फाइंडर में एफ पॉंइन्ट का न होना इसकी खामिया हैं । बिना एक्सेसरीज और लेंसेस के डीएसएलआर खरीदना वास्तव में बुद्धिमानी का सौदा नहीं कहा जा सकता पर फोटोग्राफी की शुरुआत कर रहे लोगों के लिए यह डीएसएलआर एक बढिया विकल्प है । वाईफाई की मदद से जहां कैमरे में फोटो शेयर की जा सकती है वहीं इसमें रिमोट कंट्रोल द्वारा फोटो शूट करने की सुविधा यूजर को मिलेगी । दूसरे फीचरों पर नजर डालें तो निकॉन में रेज् सपोर्ट के साथ पिक् फुल एचडी रिकार्डिंग की सुविधा दी गई है । नए मॉडल में ज्

फिजिकल मोड मौजूद हैं । कैमरे में इंच की एलसीडी स् इनबिल् है । कैमरे लगी स् की सबसे बड़ी खासियत है इसकी स् को डिग्री तक मोड़ सकते हैं । निकॉन कूल पिक् कीमत रुपए कैमरा साइज एमएम वेट ग्राम रेज् मेगापिक् फोकल लेंथ एमएम ऑप् जूम एक् एलसीडी डिस् इंच डॉट्स आईएसओ वीडियो रिकार्डिंग रेज् कूल पिक् एस ट्रैवलिंग लवर्स के लिए अच् केमरा है । क् इसका साइज कैनन पॉवर शॉट एसएक् के मुकाबले थोड़ा कॉम् है । कैनन में

सकते हैं । फुजीफिल्म मिनी एक साधारण ऑपरेशनल सिस्टम वाला कैमरा जिससें फोटो खींच कर हाथों हाथ उसका प्रिंटआउट लिया जा सकता है । इस कैमरे से डिफरेंट मोड्स तथा ब्राइटनेस एडजस्ट करके अच्छी फोटोज ली जा सकती

आउटपुट वीएफआर एलसीडी जैसे फीचर्स दिए गए हैं । अच्छी बनावट और र्इयर टिप्स हैं । हार्इ इंस्ट्रूमेंट डेंसिटी को संभाल सकता है । बिल्कुल साधारण सी बात है यदि आप ऑडियो एक्सपीरिएंस की क्वालिटी और उसके प्रकार के बारे में थोड़ा भी गंभीर हैं आप अपने कानों पर भी ध्यान देना चाहते हैं तो आपको को अपनाना होगा । हालांकि आपको इन र्इयर्स की एक जोड़ी पर होने वाले खर्च के मुकाबले अधिक कीमत भी चुकानी होगी । यदि भारतीय शास्त्रीय और वोकल म्यूजिक आपकी चीज है तो आप संभवत वार्मर साउंड सिग्नेचर के एक पेयर के साथ जाकर अच्छा करेंगे । यह इसको एक तरफ रू. की कीमत वाले हार्इ एण्ड माइक्रोस तथा एक्सबीए और एक्सट्रीम हार्इ एण्ड कीमत वाले और के बीच में रखता है जिसकी कीमत रू. से भी अधिक है । यदि आप इसे खरीद सकते हैं तो इसके लिए जरूर जायें । यह एक ऑडियोफाइल कलेक्टेबल है । इसका आयाम इसलिए रोमांचक है क्योंकि इसमें हमेशा जैसे जेम्स को खोजने की संभावना रहती है । कीमत प्रॉडक्ट के बारे में व्यक्ति की भोली भाली समझ को गैरजरूरी ढंग से प्रभावित करती है । इसके बॉक्स बंडल में एक कैरी केस था जिससे यह काफी सुंदर दिख रहा था । रेगुलर साइज के अलावा आपको ऐसा भी प्रकार मिलता है जिसमें किनारों के पीछे थोड़ी सी फोम की लाइनिंग है । जिसे एक बेहतर सील और यह बताने की जरूरत नहीं कि बेहतर आइसोलेशन होता है । इसका हाउसिंग स्टेनलेस स्टील से निर्मित है इसलिए बहुत भारी है । बैलेंस्ड आर्मेचर ड्राइवर हार्इ एण्ड स्पेक्ट्रम को संभालता है जबकि डायनेमिक ड्राइवर बास फ्रीक्वेंसी पैदा करता है । हालांकि हमारे पास भी है जिसमें क्वाड ड्राइवर्स हैं हर कान के लिए चार ड्राइवर्स । परफॉर्मेंस और सच्चार्इ वास्तव में उत्कृष्ट है । टेस्ट के बीच में ही रेफरेंस हेडफोन के लाइन अप के स्तर को अपग्रेड करना पड़ा । हालांकि बोस क्यूसी में साउंड सिग्नेचर के सारे मजे हैं फिर भी मैंने पाया कि में अपेक्षाकृत कम जोर वाला मिड रेंज था । इसमें पर्याप्त बास है और इसे पोक्र्यूपिन के हेट सॉन्ग्स मैसिव अटैक के एंजल जैसे ट्रैक्स पर समझा जा सकता है । फ्लैट रिस्पॉन्स वाले उत्साही लोगों जो अपने ऑडियो में बहुत बूम पसंद नहीं करते हैं के लिए यह हेडफोन बहुत ही प्यारा होगा । लेकिन यह सर्वश्रेष्ठ नहीं हो सकता है मिड रेंजेज द्वारा आपके कुछ ट्रैक्स को दबा जाने के बाद खास तौर से वोकल चालित म्यूजिक की आवाज उतनी अच्छी नहीं होगी । फिसलर के प्रेशर कूकर की इस नई रेंज को वीटाकंट्रोल डिजिटल के नाम से पेश किया गया है जो खाना बनाने वाले से मैसेज के जरिए संवाद स्थापित करते हैं । इतना ही नहीं बल्कि फिसलर के इन प्रेशर कूकर में खाना बनाने की विधियों समेत पोषण संबंधी जानकारी भी मौजूद है । जर्मन कंपनी फिसलर ने लॉन्च किया प्रेशर कूकर प्रेशर कूकर में आई खराबी को भी मैसेज कर बताएगा

तथा अन्य पार्ट्स का इस्तेमाल किया गया है । अलग अलग तरह की रोटियां बनाने के लिए इस पर लगे छोटे से एलसीडी स्क्रीन के जरिए रोटी की मोटाई तेल की मात्र आदि सेट करने के बाद यह उसी तरह की रोटियां बनाकर देती है । इसकी कीमत लगभग हजार रूपए होगी । आज ज्यादातर लोग अत्याधुनिक तकनीक पर बने स्मार्ट होम एप्लायंस की खरीदारी कर रहे हैं लेकिन इनके खतरे भी कम नहीं । बाजार में आए इन स्मार्ट होम एप्लायंस को एक एप के

करते हुए आंखों पर बहुत ज्यादा जोर नहीं पड़ेगा । इसकी स्क्रीन इंच की है । इसमें जीबी की हार्ड डिस्क और दो जीबी रैम है जो गीगाहर्टज इंटेल पेंटियम प्रोसेसर के साथ काम करने की स्पीड को बेहतर बनाता है । एक साथ कई एप्लीकेशन पर काम करने से भी इस लैपटाप की स्पीड पर बहुत ज्यादा असर नहीं पड़ता है । फिल्मों गेमिंग और वीडियो को प्राथमिकता देने वालों के लिए यह अच्छा विकल्प हो सकता है । इसमें विंडोज़ और अन्य

जो निर्माता विंडोज द्वारा निर्धारित है । डिवाइस का सकारात्मक विशेषताओं के इनपुट कूलर काम पर कोई आवाज नहीं एक सोने मोड ढक्कन बंद करने या सत्ता बटन दबाने में प्रवेश करने की क्षमता शामिल है । योगा अल्ट्राबुक कंपनी द्वारा लांच किया गया योगा लैपटॉप एक कनवर्टिबल अल्ट्राबुक है । इस अल्ट्राबुक में प्वाइंट तक की मल्टी टच विशेषता है और साथ ही इसकी स्क्रीन डिग्री के आकार में पूरी घूम जाती है । यह लैपटॉप आपको मार्केट में रुपये के दाम पर मिल सकता है । लेनोवो के सबसे पतले लैपटॉप में से एक लेनोवो गीगालैन को सपोर्ट करता है इस लैपटॉप में डीवीडी ड्राइव व एएमडी प्रोसेसर लगाया गया है । इस लैपटॉप में एक्यूटाइप की बोर्ड लगाया गया है और साथ ही की बोर्ड के की को काफी बेहतर डिजाइन और आकार दिया गया है जिसकी बदौलत टाइप करते समय आपको काफी अच्छा लगेगा । लैपटॉप लेनोवो आइडिया पैड एक रोमांचक वीडियो गेम के लिए अपने समय बिताना पसंद करते हैं जो उन लोगों के लिए एकदम सही है । यह इस नोटबुक लेनोवो एक छवि मॉडल के लिए अधिक है कि माना जाता है हालांकि यह बहुत अच्छा ग्राफिक्स कार्ड के साथ सुसज्जित है वीडियो

में दो कोर हैं और इंटेल हाइपर थ्रेडिंग टेक्नोलॉजी के साथ से ज्यादा थ्रेड्स । यह न केवल लैपटॉप है बल्कि यह टैबलेट के रूप में भी उपयोग किया जा सकता है । इसके साथ ही डिवाइस में दो यूएसबी पोर्ट एक एचडीएमआई पोर्ट वाई फाई और ब्लूटूथ जैसे कनेक्टिविटी ऑप्शंस शामिल है । इस रेंज में लैपटॉप का वजन किलोग्राम होता है जो भारी है । परंतु काम सीधे इसके उलट है । मेरे सीरीज के कॉम्पैक नोटबुक में शुरू से ही समस्या बनी रही थी । यह धुंआधार गर्म होता था यदा कदा डिस्प्ले नहीं आता था वायरलेस नेटवर्क कार्ड में गड़बड़ी थी डीवीडी रेकॉर्डर खराब हो गया था इत्यादि । बार रिपेयर होने के बाद भी उसके वायरलेस ने पूरा काम करना बंद कर दिया था । मेरी महीने की वारंटी खत्म हो गई थी तो मैं मरता क्या न करता यूएसबी वायरलेस नेटवर्क कार्ड अतिरिक्त रुपए खर्च कर ले आया । गेमिंग बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में इसका शानदार प्रदर्शन इसे सबसे आगे ला खड़ा करता है । इसके अलावा इसमें फुल एचडी डिस्प्ले है जो कि बहुत कम लैपटॉप्स में देखी जाती है । एचपी एन्वी आइडियापैड की तुलना में स्लिम और हल्का है । एक अच्छे गेमिंग परफॉरमेंस के साथ एक अच्छी बनावट वाला लैपटॉप है जिसे खरीदारी करते समय ज़रूर ध्यान में रखना चाहिए । इस नोटबुक की बनावट बेहतरीन है । इसमें इसके चेसिस के आसपास ज़्यादातर प्लास्टिक का इस्तेमाल हुआ है लेकिन इसकी क्वालिटी काफी अच्छी है । हाई एंड एचपी नोटबुक्स की लुक्स हमेशा बेहतरीन होती है – अत्याधुनिक और एग्रेसिव लुक जो हर किसी को भाते हैं । इसका कलर मिडनाइट ब्लैक मेटल है और मैं कहूँगा कि इसके कवर का ब्रश्ड मेटल फिनिश ज़बरदस्त है । इसमें कोई शक नहीं कि एन्वी की बनावट शानदार है । नार्मल टाइपिंग के लिए कीबोर्ड काफी स्मूथ है और हाथ रखने की जगह बिल्कुल सॉलिड है । इसका कवर भी काफी मज़बूत दिखता है । लेकिन इसका डिस्प्ले हिन्ज़ उतना टाइट नहीं है जितना इसे होना चाहिए और इसीलिये इस्तेमाल करते वक्त अचानक कोई मूवमेंट होने पर इसका डिस्प्ले कभी कभी अपने पोजीशन से हिल जाता है । एन्वी का वज़न किलोग्राम है से बड़े डिस्प्ले वाली मशीन के लिए ये वज़न कुछ ज्यादा नहीं कहा जा सकता । हालाँकि इसमें ब्लू रे ड्राइव नहीं है जो कि में है लेकिन इसका कीबोर्ड डिस्प्ले और लुक काफी बेहतर है । एचपी एन्वी के स्पेसिफिकेशन लिस्ट पर नज़र डालें तो ये काफी बेहतर मालूम होती है । इसमें इंटेल कोर क्वाडकोर प्रोसेसर है । इसमें एनवीडिया जीफ़ोर्स ग्राफ़िक्स है जो बहुत शक्तिशाली तो नहीं है लेकिन इसे एक संतोषजनक गेमिंग क्षमता प्रदान करती है । एन्वी का डिस्प्ले की तुलना में काफी ब्राइट और क्रिस्प है । इसमें का हार्ड ड्राइव है जो काफी स्टोरेज क्षमता प्रदान करता है । इसमें विंडोज ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम दिया गया है । इसमें बहुत सारे प्रीलोडेड सॉफ्टवेयर और एप्स हैं जिनको अनइनस्टॉल करना ज़रूरी है क्योंकि ये इस्तेमाल करने में व्यवधान डालते हैं । एन्वी का शानदार परफॉरमेंस आपको खुश कर देगा । लेकिन अन्य परीक्षणों में पीछे रह गया है । इस हिसाब से देखें तो का परफॉरमेंस बेहतर होना चाहिए था लेकिन हैरानी की बात है कि बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में ऐसा नहीं है और ये से पीछे रह जाता है । इसके डिस्प्ले का रेजोल्यूशन पिक्सेल है । की तुलना में इसकी स्क्रीन ज्यादा ब्राइट और क्रिस्प है और इसमें रंग गहरे और बेहतर नज़र आते हैं । एचपी एन्वी का कीबोर्ड भी से काफी बेहतर है । बैटरी लाइफ की अगर बात करें तो ये हमें प्रभावित नहीं करती । दोनों का बैटरी परफॉरमेंस काफी हद तक सामान है । एक पावरफुल मशीन में बहुत ज्यादा बैटरी लाइफ की उम्मीद नहीं की जा सकती इस दृष्टिकोण से इसका बैटरी परफॉरमेंस संतोषजनक कहा जा सकता है । हमने की ग्राफ़िक्स परफॉरमेंस से बेहतर होने की उम्मीद की थी लेकिन ऐसा नहीं हुआ और ये थोडा कम ही रहा । इसका कीबोर्ड शानदार है और इस पर टाइपिंग करना एक बहुत अच्छा अनुभव देता है । आप इस लैपटॉप को प्रतिदिन के काम के लिए और हर मामले में शानदार परफॉरमेंस के लिए खरीद सकते हैं । क्रोमबुक के दोनों मॉडलों में जीबी मैमोरी जीबी फ्लैश स् और जीबी का एक् गूगल ड्राइव स् दिया गया है । कुल मिलाकर इसकी परफॉरमेंस काफी अच्छी कही जा सकती है । इस कीमत में उपलब्ध अन्य विकल्पों पर नज़र डालें तो इसका लुक और फील काफी बेहतर है । इसमें नंबर पैड अलग से दिया गया है । इसमें काफी बड़ा टचपैड और हाथ रखने के लिए पर्याप्त ज़गह है । यह ना सिर्फ से आगे रहता है बल्कि सारे ग्राफ़िक्स बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में ये अपने सभी प्रतिद्वंदियों को काफी पीछे छोड़ देता है । ग्राफ़िक्स में का प्रदर्शन लाज़वाब है और इस दृष्टिकोण से इसे एक बेहतरीन गेमिंग नोटबुक कहा जा सकता है । आसुस विवोबुक अपने काफी कॉम्पैक्ट साइज़ में बहुत अच्छा परफॉरमेंस देता है । लेकिन इसका परफॉरमेंस कोर प्रोसेसर वाले एचपी पविलियन के जैसा तेज़ नहीं है । विवोबुक की बेहतरीन बनावट इसकी खास विशेषता है । यह लैपटॉप पीछे की तरफ थोड़ा सा मोटा और आगे की तरफ थोड़ा पतला है इससे कीबोर्ड थोडा ऊंचा रहता है और जिससे टाइप करने में आराम रहता है । यही ब्रश्ड मेटल फिनिश पूरे चेसिस पर भी है । हालाँकि इसका टचपैड सामान्य नोटबुक्स जैसा बड़ा तो नहीं है लेकिन इस लैपटॉप के आकार के हिसाब से ये काफी बड़ा है । जगह के हिसाब से की स्पेसिंग बहुत अच्छी है और इसमें सबसे अच्छी बात टाइपिंग के समय इसका सर्वोत्तम ट्रेवल और तेज़ की रिस्पोंस है । शिफ्ट एंटर और बैकस्पेस की बिलकुल उसी ज़गह हैं जिसके हम अभ्यस्त हैं और इनके स्थान से कोई छेड़ छाड़ नहीं की गयी है । विवोबुक के पतले डिज़ाइन के कारण इसमें ऑप्टिकल ड्राइव देना संभव नहीं था । और इसलिए एक अच्छा कीबोर्ड और टचपैड काफी मददगार साबित होता है । इसके डिस्प्ले में सिर्फ एक कमी है और वो है इसका रिफ्लेक्टिव होना । विवोबुक में इंटेल कोर प्रोसेसर के साथ रैम है । सामान्य कामकाज में इसका परफॉरमेंस काफी अच्छा है । इसका कीबोर्ड और टचपैड भी काफी अच्छा है और इस पर टाइप करना बहुत आसान है । इसमें एएमडी प्रोसेसर है जीबी हार्ड डिस्क औ जीबी रैम । इस लैपटाप को अल्ट्राबुक का लुक देने में तो लिनोवो को सफलता मिली है । लेकिन इसका प्रोसेसर कमजोर है । दिलचस्प बात है कि लगभग इसी कीमत में लिनोवो का माडल इंटल के कोर प्रोसेसर के साथ मिल सकता है जो परफार्मेंस के मामले में बेहतर है । फौरी तौर तो उपभोक्ता को लग सकता है कि इसकी स्पीड बहुत अच्छी है लेकिन प्रोसेसर बहुत मजबूत न होने से कई एप्लीकेशन्स एक साथ चलाने पर इसकी गति धीमी पड़ सकती है । इस लैपटाप की एक कमी यह है कि इसमें कोई आप्टिकल ड्राइव नहीं है । फोन में चार सेल की बैटरी है जो कुछ ही घंटे चल पाती है । अगर आप छात्र यां गृहिणी हें जिसे रोजाना कुछ देर लैपटाप पर अपनी जरुरत का छोटा मोटा काम यां नेट सर्फिंग करनी है तो इसे खरीदने में कोई हज़ नहीं लेकिन कामकाजी व्यक्तियों के लिए यह बहुत उपयुक्त नहीं है । इतनी कीमत में यां कुछ और पैसे डालकर इससे कहीं बेहतर लैपटाप मिल सकता है । इस लैपटाप की खासियत है इसकर एंटी रिफलेक्टिव स्क्रीन मतलब यह कि इस पर काम करते हुए आंखों पर बहुत ज्यादा जोर नहीं पड़ेगा । सैमसंग इसमें डोस आपरेटिंग सिस्टम उपलब्ध करवा रहा है । ट्रायल के तौर पर नोर्टन एंटी वायरस भी इसके साथ मिलेगा । अपने सेगमेंट में यह लेपटॉप एपल मैकबुक एयर को चुनौति देने वाला है । इंच एलईडी ब्राइटव्यू टच डिस्पले स्क्रीन है । इनकी सबसे खास बात इनका कॉम्पेक्ट साइज में होना है जिसके चलते ये वजन में हल्के हैं और इन्हें जेब में रखकर कहीं भी ले जाया जा सकता है । एस्युस वियाओ सीरीज के इस नए कंप्यूटर को चौथी जनरेशन के इंटेल कोर टीएम और आई अथवा सेलेरोन प्रोसेसर के साथ उतारा गया है जिसके चलते इनकी परफोर्मेश शानदार है । इसमें एक और खास बात ये है कि इन पीसी को किसी भी डेस्कटॉप मोनिटर से जोड़ा जा सकता है । इनके द्वारा जारी की जानी वाली तस्वीरों का रेजोल्युशन / यूएचडी है जो बहुत ही शानदार है । इन कंप्यूटर्स को पर्सनल और बिजनेस दोनों काम के लिए उपयोग में लिया जा सकता है । कंप्यूटर चिप नाम से आया है । इतना ही नहीं बल्कि इस कंप्यूटर से वो सभी काम किए जा सकते हैं जो एक नॉर्मल कंप्यूटर पर किए जा सकते हैं । यदि कोई यूजर इसमें वीजीए अथवा एचडीएमआई पोर्ट आदि लगवाना चाहता है उसे इसके लिए डॉलर और डॉलर अतिरिक्त देने होंगे । यह एक फुली फंक्शनल कंप्यूटर है जिसमें ब्लूटुथ वाय फाय तथा एचडीएमआई पोर्ट आदि सबकुछ है । इसी के चलते माइक्रोसॉफ्ट अब लेपटॉप सेगमेंट में अपनी पकड़ वापस से मजबूत करने के चलते सस्ती कीमत में शानदार फीचर्स वाला नया लेपटॉप लेकर आ रही है जिसकी कीमत से हजार रूपए के बीच में होगी । इसे विशेषकर भारतीय बाजार और शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में उपयोग को ध्यान में रखकर बनाया जा रहा है । यह सस्ता लेपटॉप वेब सर्फिग और वर्ड प्रोसेसिंग जैसे कार्यो के लिए बेहतर विकल्प हो सकता है । मैकबुक का यह नया आया संस्करण अब तक का सबसे पतला मैकबुक है जिसकी मोटाई महज एमएम है । डेल लैटिटयूड की कीमत रूपए और डेल लैटिटयूड की कीमत रूपए से शुरू होती है । दोनों ही नोटबुक्स में प्रोसेसर की च्वॉयस दी गई है । इनमें नोटबुक में फ्लैश के साथ एम बॉटम कैमरा है और एचडी वेबकैम दिया गया है । स्वाइप अल्टीमेट विंडोज ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम पर काम करता है । इसमें बेहतर परफोर्मेस के लिए इंटेल एटॉम गीगाहर्त्ज प्रोसेसर और की रैम दी गई है । स्वाइप अल्टीमेट में मेगापिक्सल कैमरा पीछे की तरफ और एमपी कैमरा आगे की तरफ दिया गया है । इसका डिस्प्ले हिन्ज़ काफी टाइट है और इस्तेमाल करने पर डिस्प्ले अपनी ज़गह से हिलता नहीं है । आइडियापैड का बैटरी परफॉरमेंस उतना अच्छा नहीं है और इसकी बैटरी मिनट तक चलती है । कवर खोलने पर इसका साफ़ सुथरा कीबोर्ड काफी आकर्षक दिखाई देता है । इसमें तीन यूएसबी पोर्ट और मेमोरी कार्ड रीडर के साथ फुल ईथरनेट पोर्ट और एचडीएमआई आउट दिया गया है । आसुस विवोबुक के डिस्प्ले साइज़ के कारण यह लैपटॉप काफी छोटा हल्का और पोर्टेबल है । इसका टचस्क्रीन एक अतिरिक्त लाभ है लेकिन एक नोटबुक में टचस्क्रीन के इस्तेमाल की बहुत कम ज़रूरत पड़ती है । इसके डिस्प्ले में टेक्स्ट बहुत अच्छी तरह से दिखाई पड़ता है । रंग काफी गहरे हैं और ब्लैक लेवल इस कीमत के रेंज में सर्वोत्तम में से एक है । कोर प्रोसेसर इस कीमत के रेंज में काफी स्टैण्डर्ड है और दूसरे विकल्प के रूप में एएमडी डुएल कोर और क्वाड कोर प्रोसेसर आते हैं । अगर बजट डिवाइस के तौर पर इन्हें देखें तो इनके डिस्प्ले में कोई कमी नहीं बताई जा सकती है । सिल्वर ग्रे रंग में उपलब्ध इस लैपटाप की एक साल की वारंटी है । लैपटाप में मेगापिक्सल का वेबकैम है और इन वन कार्ड स्लाट भी । यह इंटेक के बे ट्रेल प्रोसेसर से लैस होगा । महज पाउंउ वजनी नए मैकबुक में एलईडी के साथ बड़े बटन दिए गए हैं । इसके अलावा यह गीगाहर्त्ज डयूलकोर प्रोसेसर और जीबी फ्लैश स्टोरेज वेरियंट में भी उतारा गया है । जो हम यहाँ टेस्ट कर रहे हैं वो और लेनोवो आइडियापैड और सोनी की प्राइस सामान है लगभग रूपये । लेकिन आश्चर्यजनक रूप से अन्य परीक्षणों में पीछे रह गया है । मार्क बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में थोडा आगे ज़रूर रहता है लेकिन मार्क और यूनीजेन टेस्ट में ये से काफी पीछे रहता है । इसके अलावा गूगल ऐप्स और अन्य फीचर जैसे यूजर्स एक साथ वीडियो चैटिंग कर सकते हैं । ये भारत के सबसे सस्ते लैपटॉप्स में से एक है । इस लैपटॉप में भी की इंटरनल मेमोरी है । इसका डिस्प्ले एंटी ग्लेयर के साथ दिया गया है । मेमोरी की बात करें तो आसुस ने इस अल्ट्राबुक में हार्ड डिस्क दी है । कंपनी का ऐसा दावा है कि / हार्ड डिस्क दूसरी ट्रेडिशनल हार्ड डिस्क से छह गुना ज्यादा तेज है । कंपनी ने अपनी इस डिवाइस के दो कलर ओब्सीडियन स्टोन और सिरेमिक अलॉय में निकाली हैं । साथ ही टचपैड भी बड़ा है । जिससे आप एक्सटर्नल मॉनिटर कनेक्ट कर सकते हैं । इसमें रैटिना डिस्प्ले प्रेशर सेंसिटिव फोर्स टच ट्रैकपैड के साथ कई अन्य हाईटेक फीचर्स दिए गए हैं । एप्पल ने अपने इस कम्प्यूटर में का क्वाड कोर इंटेल कोर प्रोसेसर दिया है । ये टू इन वन डिवाइस बिना कीपैड के टैबलेट की तरह काम करता है और कीपैड लगे होने पर ये लैपटॉप की तरह काम कर सकता है । ये डुअल सिम स्लॉट के साथ आता है । पहले वर्जन के मुकाबले नए वर्जन में बेहतर डिजाइन है । इसका मतलब टैबलेट में दो सॉफ्टवेयर थे जिसे विंडोज और एंड्रॉइड दोनों पर चलाया जा सकता था । बाकी टू इन वन से विपरीत माइक्रोमैक्स लैपटैब में सॉलिड कीबोर्ड है । के क्वाड कोर इंटेल एटम प्रोसेसर के साथ इस टैबलेट में रैम है जो मल्टीटास्किंग के लिए बेहतर साबित हो सकती है । इलाइटबुक में इंच फुल डिस्प्ले है जो टचस्क्रीन भी है । इसकी स्क्रीन से दोगुना ज्यादा बेहतर क्वालिटी की है । इन दोनों डिवाइस में ऑडियो स्पीकर्स हैं जो स्टूडियो साउंड के साथ दिए गए हैं । ये दुनिया की सबसे हल्की बिजनेस नोटबुक है । इस डिवाइस में मेगापिक्सल रियर कैमरा और मेगापिक्सल फ्रंट कैमरा दिया गया है । प्रीमियम मेटल डिवाइस में की बोर्ड के साथ इंच का टचस्क्रीन डिस्प्ले दिया गया है । टच स्क्रीन को सुविधा के अनुसार डिग्री घुमाया जा सकता है । यह अब तक का सबसे स्लिम क्रोमबुक है इसकी थिकनेस सिर्फ है । आप इसे किसी भी डिस्प्ले में प्लग करके उस डिस्प्ले को कम्प्यूटर की तरह इस्तेमाल कर पाएंगे । इस लॉक को लगाने के बाद आप बेफिक्र घूम सकते हैं । यह अत्यंत पतला और हल्का है यह दूसरे लैपटॉप कारोबारियों के लिए मानक तय करता है । इसमें लगी बैटरी एक बार फुल चार्ज होने पर घंटे का बैटरी बैकप देती है । एक ऐसा फ़ोन जिसमें है एक शानदार की पैड और ज़बरदस्त स्क्रीन । बोल्ड के मुक़ाबले इसमें ज़्यादा स्क्रीन स्पेस है और ज़्यादा बैटरी लाइफ़ है । लुक के मामलें में साफ तौर पर कहा जाए तो इसके और इसके पिछले अवतार में कोई फर्क नहीं है । प्लास्टिक का बना हुआ था जो हाथ से फिसलता था । वैसे हमने श्याओमी से इससे बेहतर करने की उम्मीद की थी । फोन का वर्जन क्वॉलकोम स्नैप ड्रैगन प्रोसेसर के साथ पेश किया गया है । इसमें जीबी का रैम यूज किया गया है और का इंटरनल स्टोरेज स्पेस दिया गया है । इसकी बैटरी लाइफ की बात करें तो यह घंटे मिनट तक चली । वैसे बता दें कि आप इसे उठाते समय इसका वजन तो महसूस करेंगे ही और इसलिए एक ही हाथ से इसे पकड़ने के लिए शुरू में थोड़ा ध्यान देने की जरूरत होगी । इसमें मेगापिक्सल का कैमरा है । इससे ली गई पिक्चर्स काफी अच्छी होती हैं । कम रोशनी में भी इसका कैमरा अच्छी एचडीआर इमेज लेता है । इससे अच्छी सेल्फी ली जा सकती है । सामने से स्मूथ है कोई मार्किंग वगैरह नहीं मिलेगी सिवाए होम बटन के करीब । इसका स्क्रीन रेजॉल्यूशन हमें पसंद आया पिक्सल । जब हमने इस बाबत चेक किया तो रिजल्ट्स काफी पॉजिटिव मिले । यूरेका श्याओमी के रेडमी नोट को कई मामलों में एकदम टक्कर देता है । यह बेहद परिष्कृत फोन है और ईमानदारी की बात तो यह है माइक्रोमैक्स के पिछले साल डेढ़ साल में आए बाकी फोन्स के मुकाबले इसे हाथ में लेना यूज करना काफी बेहतर अनुभव है । एक खास बात यह कि सूरज की रोशनी में भी आप इसे पढ़ सकते हैं । इसका इन बिल्ट स्पीकर अच्छा है और साउंड क्वॉलिटी में औसत से बेहतर है । मेगापिक्सल का रीयर कैमरा है जबकि फ्रंट कैमरा मेगापिक्सल का है । जहां कम लाइट थी वहां यूरेका को दिक्कत आई । क्लोज अप के मुकाबले चौड़े फ्रैम्स बेहतर रहे । विडियो कुछ ज्यादा ही अस्थिर थे लेकिन बाकी सब वैसा ही अच्छा रहा जैसे कि फोटोज के मामले में । इस फोन के मामले में साइनोजन ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम का होना एक बड़ा प्लस पॉइंट है । यह फैबलेट कागजी आंकड़ों पर डुअल कोर जीएचजेड प्रोसेसर इंच की स्क्रीन और मेगापिक्सल के कैमरे सहित बहुत आशाजनक लगता है । खराब कैमरा क्वालिटी फोन भारी है प्रतिस्पर्धियों के मुकाबले थोड़ा सा महंगा भी है । स्पाइस स्टेलर होराइजोन में बहुत अच्छी स्पेसिफिकेशन्स हैं जैसे इंच का डिसप्ले जिसका पिक्सल रिजॉल्यूशन में मेगापिक्सल का रियर कैमरा फ्लैश सहित फ्रंट कैमरा डुअल कोर प्रोसेसर आधारित मीडियाटैक चिपसेट और बैटरी । इसकी दाम रुपये है जो अन्य भारतीय ब्रांडों के जिनके इसी तरह के फोन की कीमत रुपये से शुरू है के मद्देनजर कुछ अधिक लगती है । हालांकि इसकी स्पेसिफिकेशन्स कागजों पर तो बहुत बेहतरीन लगती हैं चलिए जांचते हैं की असलियत में इसका प्रदर्शन कैसा है । चमकदार और साफ एलसीडी डिसप्ले है और बैटरी कैमरा साउंड आउटपुट अच्छे हैं । अव्यवस्थित यूनीबॉडी बढ़ने योग्य मेमोरी का अभाव इनकी कमियां हैं । डिसप्ले अच्छा बैकअप अौर सहज इंटरफेस । एमटीएस ने स्मार्टफोन के साथ टीवी एप्लीकेशन बंडल्ड की है जिसके कारण यूजर से अधिक चैनल के साथ लाइव टीवी देख कता है । शानदार कैमरा क्वालिटी और विडियो रिकार्डिंग साउंड और ऑडियो रिकार्डिंग क्वालिटी से भरपूर लंबी बैटरी लाइफ है । मेगापिक्सल के इमेज सेंसर के अतिरिक्त नोकिया इमेजिंग इंजिनियर्स ने ऑप्टिक्स और फ्लैश पर भी पूरा ध्यान दिया है । आगे कैमरा नहीं है अौर कैमरा की इमेज क्वालिटी खराब है है । एचटीसी वन एक्स और वन एस जहां उच्च श्रेणी के फोन हैं । शानदार प्रोसेसर और ज्यादा रैम होने के चलते इस स्मार्टफोन में कोई भी गेम चलाया जा सकता है फिर भी यह हैंग नहीं होगा । सस्ता होने के बावजूद इनफोकस स्मार्टफोन में प्रीमियम स्मार्टफोन्स जैसा डिजायन दिया गया है । इसमें इंच की एचडी टच डिस्पले स्क्रीन अच्छी चमक के साथ दी गई है जिसका रेजोल्युशन * पिक्सल है । इसकी बैटरी लाइफ काफ़ी अच्छी है । कैनवस टर्बो मिनी का ऑडियो आउटपुट अच्छा है । इस स्मार्टफोन के किनारे घुमावदार हैं यह दिखने में बहुत साधारण है । स्क्रीन के किनारे पर ज्यादा जगह की वजह से इसका पूरा साइज बढ़ गया है और इसी वजह से यह जितना बड़ा होना चाहिए था उससे ज्यादा बड़ा है । बिल्ड क्वॉलिटी के लिहाज से देखें तो माइक्रोमैक्स ने एक बहुत अच्छा स्मार्टफोन बनाया है जो हाथ में सॉलिड महसूस होता है । मोटो से तुलना करें तो मोटो में इससे थोड़ी छोटी स्क्रीन इंच है लेकिन ज्यादा रेजॉलूशन है क्लैरिटी और शार्पनेस के मामले में यूनाइट की स्क्रीन थोड़ी कमजोर है । माइक्रोमैक्स के ज्यादातर ऐप्स को आप अनदेखा कर सकते हैं लेकिन ऐसा ऐप है जो आपके हर कॉल करने पर सामने आ जाता है । आम इस्तेमाल में इसमें कहीं धीमापन या रुकावट नहीं आती है । यूनाइट की कम रेजॉलूशन वाली स्क्रीन पर आपको गेम के अच्छे ग्राफिक्स डीटेल नहीं दिखाई देंगे । म्यूज़िक भी अच्छी तरह से चलता है लेकिन ऑडियो आउटपुट बहुत अच्छा नहीं है । इसकी बैटरी एक बार के चार्ज में करीब घंटे चली । यूनाइट कैमरा के मामले में बेहतर है जिसकी वजह से कई लोग इसे लेने का फैसला कर सकते हैं । फोन काफी अच्छा है लुक वाइज़ पर इसका कॅमरा अच्छा नही है कम रोशनी मे एह अच्छी पिक नही ले पता है । इसमें ऐल्युमिनियम यूनिबॉडी है जिस पर इसे बिल्ड क्वॉलिटी के लिए फुल मार्क्स मिलते हैं । इसमें काम के कुछ अच्छे ऐप्स प्री लोडेड हैं । इस पर फुल एचडी विडियो बिना प्रॉब्लम के चल जाता है । इस फोन की एक खास बात इसमें लगा मेगापिक्सल्स का कैमरा है । यह चटख रंगों और शार्प डीटेल वाले शानदार फोटो लेता है । कम रोशनी में खींचे गए फोटो में बहुत नॉइज़ देखने को मिली लेकिन फोन डिस्प्ले में देखने पर उनकी क्वॉलिटी ठीक ठाक लगती है । इसी प्राइस रेंज में इंटेक्स ऐक्वा लिया जा सकता है जिसके स्पेसिफिकेशंस कैनवस टर्बो जैसे ही हैं लेकिन इसमें जीबी स्टॉरेज कपैसिटी है । पिछला पैनल ऐल्युमिनियम का बना है और इसे निकाला नहीं जा सकता है इसकी वजह से फोन मजबूत और प्रीमियम लगता है । इसका स्टाइलस पिछले कैनवस डूडल के स्टाइलस से बेहतर है हालांकि स्टाइलस को रखने का स्लॉट न होना बहुत खलता है । ठीक ठाक कीमत पर डूडल बड़ी स्क्रीन का बढ़िया एक्स्पीरियंस देता है । हमें इसकी परफॉर्मेंस में बहुत से इशू फील हुए । हाइ एंड गेम्स को खेलने में बहुत परेशानी हो रही थी । फ्रंट कैमरा के साथ भी थोड़ी बहुत दिक्कत आई । जेनफोन में इंच का फुल एचडी स्क्रीन है जो ज्यादा बड़ी है डिस्प्ले थोड़ा डिम है कुल मिलाकर स्क्रीन को शार्प नहीं कह सकते हैं । दोनों ही स्मार्टफोन विंडोज फोन मोबाइल ऑपरेटिंग

में इनबिल्ट इंटरनल स्टोरेज है जिसमें से जीबी एप्लिकेशन्स और यूजर डाटा के लिए उपलब्ध है जब आप पहली बार फोन को बूटअप कर रहे हो । ये बात गेमर्स को थोड़ा निराश कर सकती है क्योंकि इसमें माइक्रोएसडी स्लॉट नहीं दिया गया है । यह स्मार्टफोन यूएसबी ओटीजी को सपोर्ट करता है जिसका मतलब है कि आप यूएसबी ड्राइव में प्लग इन कर सकते हैं और माइक्रो यूएसबी पोर्ट के मदद से अन्य डिवाइस लगा सकते हैं । जियाओमी ने दावा किया है कि एमआइयूआइ भाषाओं हिंदी बंगाली कन्नड़ तेलुगू मलयालम तमिल को सपोर्ट करता है मगर हमने सातवीं भाषा मराठी को भी सेटिंग मेन्यु में पाया । जब जियाओमी से कॉल की गई तो कोई परेशानी महसूस नही हुई । दोनों सिम पर फोन को सपोर्ट करता है । जब म्यूजिक सुन रहे हो मूवी देख रहे हो या कॉल कर रहे हो तो उस दौरान लाउडस्पीकर अच्छा काम करते हैं । यह कैमरा अपार्चर और डिग्री के वाइड एंगल व्यू लेंस के साथ आगे की तरफ बनाया गया है । इनबिल्ट माइक ऑडियो के लिए अच्छा काम करते हैं । एमआइ में ब्युटिफिकेशन फीचर दिया गया है जो रिंकल और फेस के अन्य दाग धब्बों को रिमूव करके सेल्फी व पिक्चर्स के मजे को दोगुना बना देता है

बहुत बड़ा फोन है मार्केट में फिलहाल उपलब्ध सभी फैबलेट में नेक्सस सबसे बड़ा फैबलेट है । मिमी मोटाई वाला यह डिवाइस ग्राम के वजन के साथ आया है जो बाजार में उपलब्ध फैबलेट्स से ग्राम ज्यादा भारी है । स्क्रीन बड़ा बोल्ड व वाइब्रेंट है । इसमें फ्रंट फेसिंग स्पीकर्स और वाइड एंगल्स हैं सिसे इंच के स्क्रीन पर वीडियो देखना मनोरंजक है । बड़े साइज के कारण इसे एक हाथ से कंट्रोल करना मुश्किल है । इतनी कम कीमत में इतने अच्छे स्पेसिफिकेशन फीचर के साथ इसे खरीदना अपने आप में एक अच्छा अनुभव ही साबित होगा । इंच के डिस्प्ले वाले स्मार्टफोन में एमएएच की बैटरी साधारण बात नहीं इसलिए इसके डिजायन से कुछ समझौता किया गया है । फ्यूल का यूएसपी इसका बैटरी बैकअप ही है । इसकी एमएएच की बैटरी इसे विशेष बनाती है । एक सिंगल चार्ज पर यह एक दिन से ज्यादा साथ निभाती है । फोन में एमएएच की बैटरी है । इसमें जीएचजेड क्वाडकोर प्रोसेसर के अलावा जीबी की इंटरनल मेमोरी है । यह फोन एंड्रायड किटकैट पर रन करता है इसकी कीमत करीब रुपये है । जीबी के रैम की वजह से इसका परफार्मेंस काफी अच्छा है । लावा आयरिस फ्यूल में बीएसआई इमेज प्रोसेसर के साथ मेगापिक्सल का रियर कैमरा है । इसमें रियर पैनल पर एलइडी फ्लैश है व मेगापिक्सल का फ्रंट कैमरा है । कुल मिला कर लावा आयरिस फ्यूल रुपये तक के स्मार्टफोन कैटेगरी में मिलने वाला बेहतर कैमरा

स्नैपड्रगन प्रोसेसर है । इसकी हर चीज इतनी आसान है कि यूजर को इसे कंट्रोल करने को एक बूंद पसीना भी नहीं बहाना पड़ेगा । इस फैबलेट में बड़ा बैटरी भी लगा है जो बिना बैटरी सेविंग मोड को एक्टिव किए ही एक दिन चल सकता है । नेक्सस में क्यूआई वायरलेस चार्जिंग है जो काफी उपयोगी है । नेक्सस में मोटोरोला का एक्टिव डिस्प्ले नोटिफिकेशन भी है । ऑप्टिकल इमेज स्टेबलाइजेशन के साथ मेगापिक्सल का कैमरा काफी अच्छा है । वीडियो रिकार्डिंग भी बेहतर है । कंटेंट व टेक्सट के डिस्प्ले के लिए इसका स्क्रीन काफी बेहतर है । एस हेल्थ यूजर के प्रतिदिन के फिजिकल एक्टिीविटी का स्नैपशॉट मुहैया कराएगा । यह एप नोट में लगे सेंसर्स से जुड़ा है जो यूजर के शरीर के अंदर होने वाले प्रतिक्रियाओं पर भी नजर रखता है जैसे स्ट्रेस लेबल हर्ट रेट ब्लड में ऑक्सीजन लेबल आदि । नोट फ्लैगशिप डिवाइस है हालांकि यह नेक्सस की तरह स्मूथ नहीं है । कनेक्टीविटी की बात करें तो यह एक बेहतर डिवाइस है । जीपीएस काफी बढिय़ा है व कॉल की क्वालिटी भी अच्छी है । अगर आप अपने फोन पर इंटरनेट का उपयोग नहीं कर रहे हैं तो यह घंटे तक आपका साथ देगी व इंटरनेट के साथ घंटे तक और घंटे तक आप लगातार इसका उपयोग कर सकते हैं । इसमें ऑप्टिकल इमेज स्टेबलाइजेशन के साथ एमपी का रियर कैमरा लगा है । अच्छी रोशनी में तो यह साथ देगी ही कम रोशनी में भी इससे क्लिक की गयी तस्वीरें काफी उम्दा हैं । इसके अलावा इसमें मेगापिक्सल का फ्रंट कैमरा है जिससे आप बेहतर सेल्फी क्लिक कर सकेंगे । यदि क्वालिटी की बात करें तो कैमरा बहुत खास नहीं है लेकिन जिस कीमत में यह डिवाइस मिल रहा है उस हिसाब से कैमरा क्वालिटी अच्छी है । जेनफोन का कैमरा कम रोशनी में भी अच्छी तस्वीरें क्लिक कर सकता है । जेनफोन को कंपनी ने दो मॉडल में लांच किया है जीबी व जीबी मेमोरी जिन्हें बढ़ाया भी जा सकता है । यदि डिवाइस के कैमरे की बात की जाए तो इसमें मोशन पिक्चर व वॉयस पिक्चर दोनों विशेषताएं मौजूद हैं लेकिन इससे ली गई तस्वीरें उम्मीद से कुछ कम हैं । यदि आप दिन के उजाले में तस्वीर लें तो उसमें आपको ब्लू टिंट ज्यादा देखने को मिलेगा और इसके अलावा रात को घर के अंदर ली गई तस्वीर को यदि जूम किए बिना लिया जाए तो अच्छी आ सकती है । सबसे ऊपर ऑडियो जैक है और सबसे निचले भाग पर यूएसबी पोर्ट उपस्थित है । इसके अलावा इसकी एमएएच की बैट्री आपको से घंटे तक का पॉवर दे सकती है इसका मतलब है आपको समय समय पर डिवाइस को फुल चार्ज करना होगा । इंच एचडी डिस्प्ले और जीबी रैम के साथ मोटो एक्स पैक में गीगा हर्ट्ज ड्यूअल कोर स्नैपड्रैगन प्रो चिपसेट भी डाला गया है । से जीबी एक्सपैंडेबल मेमोरी के साथ और यह नैनो सिम को सपोर्ट करता है । इसका वजन ग्राम है । दिखने में आईफोन जैसे लगने वाले मैजू नोट काफी आकर्षक स्मार्टफोन है ।

पांच कलर्स की च्वॉयस में उतारा गया है । लेनोवो एक स्लिम स्मार्टफोन है जो दिखने में काफी अच्छा लगता है । यह महज मिलिमीटर पतला है और इसका वजन भी महज ग्राम है । इस स्मार्टफोन को ब्लैक और पर्ल व्हाइट के दो रंगों में उपलब्ध उपलब्ध कराया गया है । इसमें मेगापिक्सल कैमरा ऑटो फोकस के साथ पीछे तथा एमपी कैमरा आगे की तरफ दिया गया है । लेनोवो के इस नए स्मार्टफोन में गीगाहर्त्ज ऑक्टाकोर प्रोसेसर और जीबी रैम दिए गए है जिससें इसकी प्रोसेसिंग और परफोर्मेंश अच्छी है । म्यूजिक लवर्स के लिए यह स्मार्टफोन खास है । यह एक अच्छा एंड्रॉयड�स्मार्टफोन है�जो यूनिक तकनीक और कम कीमत में आया है । जियाओमी मोटोरोला मोइक्रोमैक्स जैसी कंपनियों के नए आए स्मार्टफोन्स का यह एक अच्छा विकल्प है । यह एक मिड रेंज स्मार्टफोन है जिसमें इंच की एचडी डिस्पले स्क्रीन गीगाहर्त्ज ऑक्टाकोर बिट प्रोसेसर इंटरनल मेमोरी एमपी फ्रंट तथा एमपी रीयर कैमरा एमएएच बैटरी ब्लूटुथ ए जीपीएस वाय फाय कनेक्टिविटी आदि फीचर्स दिए गए हैं । इसे रूपए की कीमत में उतारा गया है । कंपनी का यह सस्ता एंड्रॉयड स्मार्टफोन है जो किटकैट ओएस पर काम करता है । इसमें इंच की डिस्पले स्क्रीन गीगाहर्त्ज प्रोसेसर जीबी रेम एमपी रीयर तथा एमपी फ्रंट कैमरा इंटरनल मेमोरी एमएएच बैटरी दिए गए हैं । में इंच की एचडी डिस्पले दी गई है । इसमें मेगापिक्सल कैमरा एलईडी फ्लैश के साथ पीछे की तरफ दिया गया है जिससे अच्छी क्वालिटी के फोटो और वीडियो शूट किए जा सकते हैं । इसमें आगे की तरफ इसमें मेगापिक्सल कैमरा लगा है जिससें अच्छी क्वालिटी की सेल्फी लेने समेत वीडियो कॉलिंग की जा

एप प्री इंस्टॉल्ड है । कनेक्टिविटी के तौर इसमें वाय फाय ब्लूटुथ और वाय फाय जैसे फीचर्स दिए गए हैं । इसमें बेहतर प्रोसेसिंग स्पीड के लिए गीगाहत्र्ज क्वॉडकोर प्रोसेसर रैम इंटरनल मेमोरी दी गई है । यह जीबी तक का मेमोरी कार्ड सपोर्ट करता है । लंबे समय तक चलने वाली एमएएच की बैटरी इसमें दी गई है । इसमें गीगाहर्त्ज क्वॉडकोर मीडियाटेक प्रोसेसर रैम इंटरनल मेमोरी और माइक्रोएसडी कार्ड सपोर्ट दिए गए हैं । आर्या एक एंड्रॉयड स्मार्टफोन है जो इसके लेटेस्ट वर्जन किटकैट पर काम करता है । यह एक बेहतर कैमरा स्मार्टफोन भी है जिसमें एमपी मैन कैमरा ऑटोफोकस और सोनी बीएसआई सेंसर के साथ दिया गया है । वहीं सेल्फी और वीडियो कॉलिंग के लिए एमपी कैमरा फ्रंट में दिया गया है । फ्रंट कैमरे के मामले यह रेडमी से ज्यादा अच्छा है । कंपनी ने इसमें ईडीजीई जीपीआरएस वाय फाय ब्लूटुथ यूएसबी ओटीजी जैसे कनेक्टिविटी ऑप्शंस दिए हैं । इस अनोखे स्मार्टफोन को जेडटीई कंपनी लेकर आई है । यह एंड्रॉयड किटकैट ओएस पर काम करता है । नेटवर्क पर भी करता है काम । इसकी कीमत रुपये रखी गयी है । साथ ही इसमें जीएचजेड क्वालकॉम स्नैपड्रगन डुअल कोर प्रोसेर व जीबी का रैम है । इसमें जीबी का इंटरनल स्टोरेज है जिसे माइक्रोएसडी कार्ड के सहारे बढ़ाया जा सकता है । एमएएच की बैटरी के साथ आने वाले इस फोन में कनेक्टीविटी के लिए वाई फाई ब्लूटूथ जीपीएस एनएफसी व माइक्रो यूएसबी है । कनेक्टिविटी के साथ इस वक्त यह भारत का सबसे सस्ता स्मार्टफोन है । यह एक ही सिम को सपोर्ट करता है । इसमें पिक्सल्स रेजॉलूशन वाला इंच का एचडी आईपीएस डिस्प्ले है । डिस्प्ले में वन ग्लास सलूशन के साथ कॉर्निंग ग्लास प्रोटेक्शन का इस्तेमाल किया गया है । मेगापिक्सल का फ्रंट कैमरा है । जीबी इंटरनल स्टॉरेज है और जीबी तक का माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है । बैटरी की है । इसकी साउंड क्वालिटी अच्छी है । मोबाईल का इंटरफेस भी ठीक ठाक है । इसकी कीमत लगभग रुपये है जो भारतीय बाजार में इसे सबसे किफायती फोनों की श्रेणी में ला देती है । मसलन आप इसे नेटवर्क पर नहीं चला सकते हैं न ही इसमें वाइ फाइ का विकल्प है । लेकिन इस बात को मानना होगा कि सस्ता होने के बावजूद यह फोन दिखने में सस्ता नहीं लगता है इसकी लुक्स अच्छी हैं । फोन में क्वर्टी की पैड और बटनों के बीच सुविधाजनक जगह होने के कारण एसएमएस करने में काफी सुविधा मिलेगी । फोन की स्क्रीन इंच की है और स्क्रीन रिजोल्यूशन गुणा पिक्सल का है । इसमें एमबी का इंटरन स्टोरेज हैं और माइक्रोएसडी कार्ड लगाकर इसे जीबी तक अपग्रेड किया जा सकता है । इस तरहं किफायती कीमत होने के बावजूद इसमें कम से कम से रुपये तो इस कार्ड को लगाने के लिए आपको खर्च करने ही होंगे । इसमें एफएम रेडियो ब्लूटूथ कनेक्टीविटि कैमरा मौजूद है । हमारा मानना है कि अपने आप में यह इकलौता हैंडसेट आपके लिए एकमात्र मोबाइल के तौर पर शायद नाकाफी साबित होगा । यह स्मार्टफोन नहीं है । अगर आपको सिर्फ सीमित इस्तेमाल के लिए फोन चाहिए तो यह आपके लिए एक औसत से कुछ बेहतर विकल्प हो सकता है । लावा का यह नया ड्यूअल कोर स्मार्टफोन है । फोन का बाहरी खोल यानी कि चेसीज़ पोलीकार्बोनेट की बनी है और काफी मजबूत है । चेसीज़ की फिनिश अच्छी है जो इस फोन को दिखने में स्मार्ट बनाती है । इसमें एक गीगाहर्टज़ का ड्यूअल कोर प्रोसेसर है लेकिन रैम केवल एमबी की है जो इसकी स्पीड पर असर डालती है । स्क्रीन का गुणा एमपी है जो औसत से कमजोर है । इसकी इंटरनल स्टोरेज क्षमता जीबी है जिसे बढ़ाकर माइक्रोएसबी कार्ड से जीबी तक किया जा सकता है । दिखने में भी यह फोन काफी आकर्षक है । इसमें नवीनतम आपरेटिंग सिस्टम एंड्रायड जैली बीन लगाया गया है । फोन का वजन मात्र ग्राम और इसकी मोटाई मिलीमीटर है । इस फोन में दो सिम कार्ड और एक माइक्रो एसीबी कार्ड लगाकर इसकी स्टोरेज क्षमता को अपग्रेड किया जा सकता है । एक जीएसएम और दूसरा सिम सीडीएमएस अथवा जीएसएम नेवर्क पर लगाया जा सकता है । इसमें दो सिम कार्ड लगाए जा सकते हैं लेकिन एक को इस्तेमाल करते समय दूसरा सिम कार्ड सक्रिय नहीं होगा । फोन में इंज का हाइ डेफिनेशन डिसप्ले है रंग और ग्राफिक्स चटकीले दिखते हैं । सूरज की तेज़ रोशनी में बहुत से फोन के डिस्पले को आप देख नहीं पाते हैं लेकिन एलजी आप्टिमस जी में ऐसा नहीं है । फोन में केवल दो बटन हैं आवाज़ कम ज्यादा करने के लिए और फोन को लाॅक करने के लिए । फोन में शानदार क्वाॅडकोर प्रोसेसर है जो इसकी स्पीड को दमदार बनाता है । आपरेटिंग सिस्टम एंड्रायड जैली बीन है । लेकिन बैटरी केवल एमएएच की है जिससे इसे दिन भर बिना चार्जिंग के चलाना शायद संभव न हो पाए । इस फोन का कैमरा एमपी का है लेकिन इसकी तस्वीरें उतनी साफ नहीं है । आप इसे काम चलाउ भी कह सकते हैं । स्पीड के मामले में इसका कोई मुकाबला नहीं । अगर कई एप्लीकेशन्स एक साथ चलाना आपकी जरूरत है तो यह फोन अच्छा विकल्प साबित हो सकता है क्योंकि यह एक साथ कई काम करते हुए भी उतनी ही स्पीड से काम करता है । फोन का वजन कम है और यह दिखने में भी बेहतर है । लेकिन इसकी बैटरी कमज़ोर है । अगर आप लगातार यात्रा करने वालों में से है तो इस फोन को बार बार चार्ज करने से झंुझलाहट हो सकती है । कैमरा भी बहुत जानदार नहीं है । फोन में दो जीबी रैम है और गीगाहर्टज का क्वाड कोर प्रोसेर । इसे सुपरफोन का दर्जा दिया गया है क्योंकि इसमें कुछ ऐसे फीचर्स हैं जो अन्य किसी भी फोन में नहीं हैं मसलन इस फोन की स्क्रीन आपकी आंखों की पुलतियों हरकत को पढ़कर उस की सहूलिसत के हिसाब से काम करेगी । अगर आप दांई ओर देख रहे हैे तो फोन की स्क्रीन पर चल रही एप्लीकेशन आपकी आख्ंा की मूवमेंट को दायीं तरफ फाॅलो करते हुए एप्लीकेशन को दांयी ओर ले जाएगी और आपकी आंख की पुतलियों की मूवमेंट बाईं ओर है तो एप्लीकेशन बाईं ओर चली जाएगी । मेगापिक्सल का रियर कैमरा जिसमें फ्लैश भी है एमपी का फ्रंट कैमरा है । पांच इंच स्क्रीन पिक्सल के रिज़ोल्यूशन के साथ है । जीबी इंटरनल स्टोरेज माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड से इसे जीबी तक अपग्रेड करने की सुविधा है । जीबी की रैम है । एंड्रायड जैली बीन आपरेटिंग सिस्टम है । इसलिए इसे आप फोन और टैबलेट का संगम यानी कि फैबलेट भी कह सकते हैं । इस फोन का डिज़ाइन सादा है और बहुत आकर्षक भी नहीं है । फोन की स्क्रीन का एचडी यानी कि हाई डेफिनेशन डिसप्ले ज़रूर आकर्षक है । इस फोन में एंड्रायड जैली बीन साफ्टवेयर है जो कई एप्लीकेशन्स उपलब्ध करवाता है जिनमें गूगल नाओ भी शामिल है । इसमें पांच मेगापिक्सल का कैमरा है । इसी फोन में ठीक ठाक का वीडियो शूट करने की भी सुविधा है । फोन में नेविगेशन की स्पीड अच्छी है । इसमें एफएम रेडियो नहीं है । फोन के स्पीकर औसत दर्जे के हैं । बड़ी स्क्रीन की चाह रखने वालों को यह फोन पसंद आएगा । औसत परफार्मेंस की उम्मीद करने वाले इसे खरीद कर निराश नहीं होंगे लेकिन इससे ज्यादा की इससे उम्मीद न करें तो बेहतर होगा । इसके चलते फोन में नेवीगेशन बहुत तेजी से नहीं हो पाएगा । स्क्रीन का आकर इंच है जिसके चलते गेमिंग का अनुभव बहुत सुखद नहीं है । यह फोन वाइ फाइ पर भी काम कर सकता है । रैम केवल एमबी होने के कारण इंटरनेट और अन्य एप्लीकेशन्स बहुत तेज़ी से काम नहीं करते हैं । स्क्रीन का आकार काफी छोटा है और फोन में सिंगल कोर प्रोसेसर लगा है जो अब बीते जमाने की बात हो चुकी है । इससे कुछ सौ रूपये ज्यादा खर्च कर ज्यादा बड़ी स्क्रीन ज्यादा शक्तिशाली डयूल कोर प्रोसेसर और अन्य कई अतिरिक्त फीचर्स वाले कई स्मार्टफोन बाजार में उपलब्ध हैं । जहां यूजर्स टॉप स्क्रीन को की ओर स्वाइप करके सेटिंग बदल सकते हैं । इस मामले में यू यूरेका में काफी कुछ पसंद आने योग्य है । साइनोजेन हाल ही में बिट के मुताबिक ढला है ऐसे में इस फीचर को इनकॉरपोरेट करना बढ़िया रहा । ऑडियो इक्वेलाइजर और कुछ इफेक्ट्स डालने के लिए ऑडियोएफएक्स ऐप दिया गया है । क्योंकि कंपनी काफी कम कीमत में जो कुछ दे रही है वह थोड़े में ज्यादा देने वाली बात को साबित करता है । श्याओमी रेडमी नोट के एकदम बढ़िया विकल्प के तौर पर इसे देखा जा सकता है । स्मार्टफोन की मूनस्टोन बैक यह वन प्लस वन में आपको मिलनेवाली सॅन्डस्टोन बैक का ही सस्ता अवतार है लेकिन फिर भी यह रेडमी नोट के चिकने प्लास्टिक से अच्छा ही है । यू यूरेका मज़बूत बनावट और संतोषजनक लूक्स का स्मार्टफोन है । यह ऍसस ज़ेनफोन जैसा मनमोहक तो नहीं है लेकिन रेडमी नोट के सस्ते प्लास्टिक फील से दूर रहकर उसने अच्छा काम कर दिखाया है । साथ ही यूरेका अपने आकार की तुलना में बहुत हलका है जो उसके खाते में और भी गुण जोड़ता है । अब ज्यादा महत्वपूर्ण बातों के लिए यूरेका कुछ गिनेचुने डिवाईसो में से एक है जो फिलहाल क्वालकॉम की नई जनरेशन पर चल रहे हैं । इसका दिल ओक्टा कोर स्नैपड्रैगन प्रोसेसर पर धड़कता है और आपके रोज़ाना कार्यों को अच्छी तरह से पूरा करता है । उच्च क्षमतावाले गेम्स जैसे ऍस्फाल्ट और इनजस्टीस गॉडस् अमंग अस प्रोसेसर को कुछ खास तकलीफ़ नहीं देते । फिर भी अच्छी बात यह है कि इसमें जीबी रैम है यह उस सबके लिए पर्याप्त से भी अधिक है जिसके लिए आप अपना स्मार्टफोन इस्तेमाल करना चाहेंगे । फोन बेंचमार्क में भी आपको बढ़िया नंबर्स देता है और वास्तविक स्थितियों में परफॉर्मंस भी उससे कम नहीं है । बहुत देर तक गेम खेलने के बाद कुछ लॅग्स हुए थे लेकिन नियमित इस्तेमाल में यह बहुत ही स्मूद है । मेगा पिक्सल का कैमरा मुझे खासकर पसंद आया । पिछले महिने मैंने कहा था कि रेडमी नोट का कैमरा यह निश्चित तौर पर हज़ार के नीचे वर्ग में सबसे अच्छा है लेकिन अब मुझे अपने शब्दों को वापस लेना होगा । यूरेका द्वारा ली गई तस्वीरे कभी कभार थोडी अंडरसॅच्यूरेटेड होंगी । हालांकि वन में तस्वीरे और भी खराब होती थी और यू उन्हें उतना अंडरसॅच्यूरेटेड नहीं करता । मेरे नियमित इस्तेमाल के तहत जिसमें बहुत सारा गेमिंग और भारी बैट्री उपयोग वाले कार्य शामिल थे डिवाईस पुरे दिन तक नहीं चला । हालांकि यह बुरा नहीं था लेकिन फॅब्लेट की बैट्री लाईफ ज्यादा होनी चाहिए । जिओमी रेडमी नोट इतनी ही बैट्री लाईफ प्रदान करता है जबकि उस डिवाईस का संस्करण बुरा है । इसलिए यूरेका को जब स्पर्धा में खड़ा रहना है तो डिवाईस में बेहतर बैट्री लाईफ होनी चाहिए थी खासकर तब जब डिवाईस में बड़ी बैट्री के लिए पर्याप्त जगह भी थी । बैटरी लाइफ बढ़िया है लगभग पूरा दिन चलती है अच्छा कैमरा है । अगर एंड्राइड फोंस से इसकी तुलना करें तो परफॉरमेंस उतनी अच्छी नहीं है । अगर आप एक पॉवर यूजर हैं तो आपको इस डिवाइस को नहीं खरीदना चाहिए या आप इसे खरीदना नहीं चाहेंगे क्योंकि कहना आसान है कि यह एक पॉवरफुल डिवाइस नहीं हैं जैसे इसके प्रतिद्वंदी हैं । दूसरी और ध्यान दें या इसके दूसरे पक्ष क देखें तो यह माइक्रोसॉफ्ट लुमिया उन लोगों के लिए एक बढ़िया चुनाव है जो साधारण तौर पर स्मार्टफ़ोन के इस्तेमाल करते हैं या जो अपने फ़ोन पर डाक्यूमेंट्स और स्प्रेडशीट आदि पर ज्यादा काम करते हैं । लुमिया लुमिया लगभग पतला है और इसका वजन भी इससे लगभग ग्राम कम है । साफ़ तौर पर इसका मतलब यही है कि यह डिवाइस देखने में इतना बुरा नहीं लगता हालाँकि अगर इसकी कीमत पर गौर करी तो यह एक बढ़िया डिजाईन वाला स्मार्टफ़ोन है । इसके बनावट के लिए हमारी कोई शिकायत नहीं है । जिस कीमत पर ये डुअल सिम फोन बिक रहा है उस कीमत के लिहाज से तो ये बेहद अच्छा लगता है । डुअल कलर टोन डिजाइन मेटल का इस्तेमाल कॉम्पैक्ट लुक बैकपैनल के बीचों बीच कैमरा और उसके चारों और बड़ी सी मेटल रिंग जिसमें फ्लैश भी दिया गया है । फोन साइज और फील दोनों के मामले में काफी कॉम्पैक्ट है सॉफ्ट एज वाले कोने है जो चुभते नहीं । पहली नजर में या फिर किसी एडवर्टाइजमेंट में तो ये फोन आपका दिल जीत लेगा पर थोड़ी देर इस्तेमाल करने के बाद इसकी डिजाइन में छोटी मोटी कमियां सामने आने लगेंगी । हकीकत ये है कि मेटल के नाम पर फोन में सिर्फ चारों और मेटल रिम दी गयी है । फोन का बैकपैनल प्लास्टिक से बना है । बैकपैनल हटाते वक्त डर लगता है कि कहीं टूट ना जाए । डिजाइनिंग के मामले में इस फोन में मेटैलिक बॉडी के साथ ग्लास कवर फ्रंट पैनल दिया गया है । में पॉवर बटन के ऊपर नीचे वॉल्यूम रॉकर है जिससे बहुत कन्फ्यूजन होता है । आवाज बढ़ाने की जगह फोन की स्क्रीन बंद हो जाती है । दिखने के मामले में आपको निराश नहीं करेगा । बस इसके बैकपैनल को जरा नजाकत से ही खोलिएगा । सबसे बड़ा बदलाव तो डिजाइन में है । पिछले साल सैमसंग उम्मीदों पर खरा नहीं उतर पाया था । इसे यूजर अपनी सहूलियत के हिसाब से अलग अलग तरीके से कस्टमाइज कर सकता है । इसकी वाली डिजाइन के अपने अलग फायदे है जैसे के कारण ये फोन दिखने में से भी पतला लगता है । इसी तरह से के कारण ये फोन हाथ से आसानी से फिसलता भी नहीं है । सैमसंग के मुताबिक में इस्तेमाल किया गया ग्लास डिग्री सेल्सियस के तापमान पर मोड़ा गया है । ये कंपनी का पहला सेल्फी स्मार्टफोन है जिसमें मेगापिक्सल का फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा दिया गया है । डिजाइन के मामले में कैनवस सेल्फी बाजार में बिक रहे ज्यादातर फोन से थोड़ा अलग लगता है । इसके साथ ही इसके बैक पैनल पर कैमरे के चारों और दी गई मेटल रिम काफी अच्छी लगती है और ऐसा एहसास दिलाती है कि इस फोन का कैमरा जोरदार होगा ही होगा । यूनिबॉडी डिजाइन वाला ये फोन दिखने में बेहद खूबसूरत लगता है । जिसके कारण ये फोन हाथ से इतनी आसानी से फिसलेगा नहीं । प्लास्टिक से बना इसका बैक पैनल दिखने में काफी प्रीमियम लगता है और याद दिलाता है सैमसंग के की । यूनिबॉडी डिजाइन होने के कारण कैनवस सेल्फी की बैटरी को हटाया नहीं जा सकता ना ही इसके बैक पैनल को । माइक्रो सिम और मेमोरी कार्ड डालने के स्लॉट फोन के साइड में ही दिए गए हैं । जिसका नुकसान ये होता है कि अगर आप फिल्म देख रहे है या गेम खेल रहे है तो स्पीकर्स आपके हाथों से ढक जाते हैं । जिससे एंटरटेनमेंट के पूरे एक्सपीरियंस में एक कमी सी रह जाती है । अगर डिजाइन में हुई इस गलती को माफ किया जाए तो फोन देखने में काफी अच्छा लगता है । हालांकि कंपनी के पहले वेरिएंट की तरह जितना पतला नहीं लेकिन पतला नया जिओनी काफी स्टाइलिश और स्लिम दिखता है । फ्रंट और बैक दोनों ही साइड जिओनी ईलाइफ में कॉर्निंग गोरिल्ला ग्लास प्रोटेक्शन दिया गया है । ग्लॉसी बॉडी होने के कारण इस फोन में फिंगरप्रिंट ज्यादा दिखते हैं । फिंगरप्रिंट्स की बात को हटा दिया जाए तो ये काफी स्टाइलिश हैंडसेट लगेगा । डिस्प्ले की बात करें तो इस फोन में इंत की फुल एचडी * पिक्सल रेजोल्यूशन स्क्रीन दी गई है । कुल मिलाकर फोन भले ही पतला हो लेकिन जिओनी ने एक अच्छी बॉडी वाला फोन बना लिया है । का ये नया वर्जन भी पिछले फोन के मुकाबले काफी नई चीजें अपने साथ लेकर आया है । कम दाम में है । पैसा वसूल फोन है । ये दिखने में सस्ता भद्दा नहीं लगता । फोन की ग्रिप काफी अच्छी है आसानी से हाथ में फिसलेगा नहीं । ना स्क्रीन अच्छी ना ऑडियो में दम । कम से कम स्क्रीन तो देनी चाहिए थी । पिछले से स्क्रीन साइज बड़ा है इंच अब स्क्रीन बड़ी है तो रेजोल्यूशन भी अच्छा होना चाहिए पर यहां ये बात नहीं है । स्क्रीन नहीं है पर रंग काफी नैचुरल और ब्राइटनेस लेवल काफी बेहतर नजर आते है धूप में भी स्क्रीन पर लिखा पढ़ा जा सकता है । व्यूइंग एंगल जबरदस्त है । कुछ खास नहीं पर के की याद दिलाता है कैमरा स्लो है । माना कि सुर्खियों के पीछे की हर मंगलवार होने वाली वाली मार्केटिंग स्ट्रैटजी का अपना हाथ है पर इस बात को भी नकारा नहीं जा सकता कि के स्मार्टफोन क्वालिटी के मामले में घटिया कतई नहीं है । दिखने में अच्छा है । शानदार टचस्क्रीन है । कैमरा की क्वालिटी अच्छी है । परफॉरमेंस अच्छी है । बैटरी लाइफ अच्छी । बढिया कैमरा खूबसूरत डिजाइन और बेहतरीन फीचर्स वाले ने सबका दिल जीता था । पहली नजर में देखने पर और में कोई खास फर्क नजर नहीं आता पर गौर से देखने पर फर्क नजर आने लगता है । इंच के इस फोन को एल्यूमिनियम यूनिबॉडी कंस्ट्रक्शन से बनाया गया है । फोन के बैकपैनल पर दी गई भी कंपनी के मुताबिक लग्जरी जैव्लरी में इस्तेमाल होने वाली तकनीक से बनाई गई है । अच्छी वीडियो रिकॉर्डिंग केपेबिलिटी है । उम्मीद से कम कैमरा है । कागज पर तो भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम की तरह लगता है । एक से बढ़कर एक फीचर । मेगापिक्सल कैमरा तगड़ा क्वाड कोर प्रोसेसर रैम और की बैटरी और इन सब फीचर्स की कीमत – सिर्फ रु । पिछले फोन से अलग इस बार में डुअल मेटल फिनिश दी गई है । जिससे फोन थोड़ा और प्रीमियम लगने लगता है । को हाथ में ले कर ये तो महसूस होता है कि इसे फुर्सत से बनाया गया है । क्सपीरिया ज़ेड वन कॉम्पैक्ट स्मार्टफ़ोन में आपको मिलता है एक उपयुक्त आकार बेहतरीन हार्डवेयर और एक शक्तिशाली प्रदर्शन । परफॉर्मंस रेशो के लिए उत्कृष्ट कीमत है । अच्छी बैट्री लाईफ है । आकर्षक डिस्प्ले है । आकार के हिसाब से मोटा और भारी है । औसतन कैमरा है । मोटो जी कीमत के टॅग पर पूरी तरह से खरा उतरता है । शानदार प्रदर्शन और सरल डिज़ाईन के साथ यह स्मार्टफोन उनके लिए सर्वोत्तम है जो बजट ऍण्ड्रॉइड स्मार्टफोन की तलाश में है । मोटो जी की डिज़ाईन फ्लॅशी तो नहीं है लेकिन सरल बिना दिखावे वाली और ज्यादातर अपने बड़े भाई मोटो एक्स की तरह ही है । इसी रेंज के बाकी स्मार्टफोनो की तुलना में डिस्प्ले की क्वालिटि अच्छी है । मोटो जी के बैक पर हल्का सा उभार है जो उसे अच्छा घूमाव प्रदान करता है जिससे वह हाथ में अच्छे से बैठता है । स्मार्टफोन अपने आकार के हिसाब से थोड़ा भारी लगता है । इसके नतिजे बहुत ही अच्छे निकले जिसके लिए स्नैपड्रैगन को धन्यवाद देने चाहिए जो इस डिवाईस को पावर दे रहा है । मेन्यू और होमस्क्रीन पर स्क्रॉलिंग स्मूथ है और किसी भी समय मल्टिटास्कींग करते हुए स्मार्टफोन धीमा नहीं होता । शटर लॅग ज्यादा नहीं है और फोटो क्वालिटि अच्छी है । कम रोशनी में कुछ बारीकीयाँ मिट जाती हैं और कुछ प्रमाण में ग्रेन दिखता है । कैमरा पिक्सल के वीडीयो रिकॉर्ड कर सकता है और ऑडियो में अच्छा दम है । बैट्री ने मोटो जी को आकर्षक बनाया है जो की पर्याप्त है क्योंकि डिस्प्ले बहुत बड़ा नहीं है । हमारे बैट्री परिक्षण से पता चला है कि आप साड़ेपाच घंटो तक फुल एचडी वीडीयो लगातार चला सकते हैं । इंच के डिस्प्ले पर गेमिंग बहुत ही खुशनूमा रहा क्योंकि स्मार्टफोन ऍस्फाल्ट और फीफा बिना किसी गडबड़ी के चले । साथ ही मोटो जी ने लगभग हर प्रकार के वीडीयो बिना कीसी समस्या के चलाए । यह बताना ज़रूरी है कि मोटो जी ऊंची आवाज़ में बजनेवाले स्पीकर से सक्षम है । यह वैसे बहुत क्रीस्प नहीं है लेकिन छोटे कमरे में ऊंची आवाज़ में संगीत बजाने के लिए पर्याप्त है । सरल लूक सम्मानजनक विशेषताएं और स्पर्धात्मक कीमत के चलते मोटोरोला ने इस बार सही काम कर दिखाया है । हालांकि अगर आप कम कीमत में अच्छा परफॉर्मंस चाहते हैं तो आपको निश्चित तौर पर मोटो जी लेना चाहिए खासकर संस्करण जो रूपयों में उपलब्ध है । इसी कीमत में अन्य स्मार्टफोन भी है जो ऐसे ही या इससे भी बढ़कर विशेषताएं प्रदान कर रहे हैं लेकिन अगर ईमानदारी से कहा जाए तो मोटो जी सच में “नो नॉनसेंस” बजट ऍण्ड्रॉइड स्मार्टफोन है । इस स्मार्टफ़ोन में की बेज़ल लेस डिस्प्ले है इसके साथ ही यह क्वाड कोर स्नेप ड्रैगन प्रोसेसर पर काम करता है और इसमें एंड्राइड है । इस स्मार्टफ़ोन में आपको कोई मेमोरी कार्ड स्लॉट नहीं मिल रहा है । यह स्मार्टफ़ोन निश्चित रूप से किसी भी शीर्ष स्मार्टफ़ोन का सबसे शक्तिशाली छोटा स्वरुप है और यह आज उपलब्ध किसी भी उत्कृष्ट उच्च स्तर के एंड्रायड स्मार्टफ़ोन का मुकाबला कर सकता है । सोनी ने मोबाइल फ़ोन्स के मामले में शानदार काम किया है जबकि एक्सपीरिया ज़ेड वन पहले ही एक शानदार स्मार्टफ़ोन था सोनी ने प्रदर्शन और हार्डवेयर के मामले में समझौता न करते हुए इसे छोटे आकर में पेश करके इसे और भी बेहतर बनाया है । मेगापिक्सल कैमरा वाटरप्रूफ तकनीक और तेज़ मोबाइल प्रोसेसर के साथ ज़ेड वन कॉम्पैक्ट छोटे आकार में एक बेहद शक्तिशाली स्मार्टफ़ोन है । ज़ेड वन कॉम्पैक्ट में एक्सपीरिया ज़ेड वन की तरह ही किनारे पर धातु का फ्रेम है जो इसके चेसिस की तरह लगता है । नीचे के हिस्से में बड़ा स्पीकर ग्रिल है लेकिन इसकी आवाज़ तेज़ नहीं है और ऐसा सोनी के इसे वाटरप्रूफ बनाने की वज़ह से है । एक्सपीरिया ज़ेड वन कॉम्पैक्ट एंड्रायड जल्द ही इसे मिलने वाला है ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम पर काम करता है और इसकी दृश्यता और विशेषताएं एक्सपीरिया ज़ेड वन की तरह हैं । कुल मिलाकर इसके यूजर इंटरफ़ेस का अनुभव बहुत शानदार और सहज है । प्रदर्शन की अगर बात करें तो ज़ेड वन कॉम्पैक्ट बहुत से शीर्ष एंड्रायड स्मार्टफ़ोन्स से काफी बेहतर है । बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में यह नेक्सस को भी पीछे छोड़ देता है और अपने बड़े स्वरुप एक्सपीरिया ज़ेड वन से भी कुछ बेहतर रहता है । हमने इसमें जो थोड़ी सी कमी महसूस की वो है इसके स्पीकर की आवाज़ का कम होना । फोटो में रंग काफी सही मात्रा में रहते हैं और इसका ऑटोफोकस इतना तेज़ है कि यह कुछ उच्च स्तर के पॉइंट एंड शूट कैमरों को भी मात देने में सक्षम है । सोनी एक्सपीरिया ज़ेड वन कॉम्पैक्ट की अन्य छोटे उपकरणों से तुलना करने पर यह निर्विवाद रूप से सबसे बेहतर साबित होता है । अच्छा प्रदर्शन है । अत्यधिक कीमत है । कीमत के मामले में कोई तुलना नहीं है क्योंकि यह आईफॉन प्लस के सबसे महंगे वैरिएंट को भी सस्ता ठहराता है । ऑटोमोबाइल की तरह डिज़ाइन के बहुत सारे तत्व है । भले ही डिज़ाइन तत्व काफी स्टाइलिश रहे हैं पर एर्गोनोमिक्स के संदर्भ में वे एक दुःस्वप्न रहे हैं । उदाहरण के लिए आप इस फॉन को पकड़ने के लिए बहुत मुश्किल पाओगे जब चार्ज इत्यादि करते समय इसके फ्लेप खुले होंगे । यह बहुत बड़ा भी हैं जिसका अर्थ है कि आपको इसे चारों ओर अपने हाथ में ले जाना होगा । जो इसे आज बाजार में सबसे शक्तिशाली उपकरणों के साथ वहाँ ऊपर डालता है । हालांकि आश्चर्य की बात यह है कि यह मोटों एक्स जन जैसे से कम बेंचमार्क स्कोर देता है पर यह समग्र प्रदर्शन को प्रभावित नहीं करता लेकिन यदि आप सख्ती से आंकड़ो पर ध्यान दोगे यह फॉन आज के कई फ्लेगशिप से नीचे है जो आज हमारे बीच हैं । टोनिनी लेम्बोर्गिनी टौरी आसानी से आप के लिए देढ़ दिन तक चलेगी जो किसी भी स्मार्टफोन के लिए अच्छा है । यह अभी भी गेलक्सी नॉट आईफोन को हरा नहीं सकता । इन दिनों महज अच्छे शॉट्स लेना पर्याप्त नहीं है । टौरी का ऑटो फोकस हमारे पसंद आने से थोड़ा धीमा है और सामने रियर कैमरा दोनों कभी कभी फ्लोरोसेंट रोशनी के अंतर्गत संघर्ष करते हैं । फोन का ऑपरेटिंग शानदार है लेकिन स् में थोड़ा पीछे हो जाता है । आज के स्लीम फोन की दौर में यह थोड़ा मोटा दिखाई देता है लेकिन इसकी की बिल्ट क् बहुत ही अच्छी है । फोन की बॉडी मैट फिनिश प्लास्टिक की है । फोन का पिछला पैनल खुलता नहीं है और आप खुद से बैटरी बदल नहीं सकते । फोन के साइड पैनल में एक प्लास्टिक का बैंड दिया गया है और सिम लगाने या बदलने के लिए आपको उसी बैंड को खोलना है । फोन उपयोग में बेहद ही आसान है और टच रिस्पॉरन्स उतना ही बेहतर । मोटो ई पुरान संस्करण ऑपरेटिंग और क्वालिटी के लिए बहुत लोकप्रिय हुआ था लेकिन इसके साथ ही कम मैमरी और फ्रंट कैमरा को लेकर उसे कुछ आलोचना भी झेलनी पड़ी थी । हमें कैमरे को लेकर आशा थी कि शायद इस बार कंपनी थोड़ा बदलाव करे लेकिन ऐसा कुछ दिखा नहीं । हां वीजीए रेजल्यूशन का सेकेंडरी कैमरा अब मिलेगा । कैमरा से हटकर अगर फोन के परफॉर्मेंस की बात करते हैं तो बहुत अच्छा कहा जाएगा । मोटो ई का पिछला पैनल थोड़ा कर्व है जो इसे पकड़ने में आरामदायक बनाता है । मोटोरोला मोटो ई के बजट में कई ऐसे फोन मिलेंगे जो स्पेसिफिकेशन में इसे टक्कर देने में सक्षम होंगे लेकिन ऑपरेटिंग में इसकी बराबरी शायद कोई नहीं कर पाएगा । मेगापिक्सल का कैमरा और स्टाइलिश बॉडी भी इसकी उपयोगिता को बढ़ाते हैं । फोन में एलटीई की कमी कही जा सकती है । इसके अलावा कैमरा परफॉर्मेंस भी साधारण है । मेगापिक्सल कैमरा के बावजूद पिक्चकर क्वालिटी साधारण है । वहीं परफॉर्मेंस भी अच्छा है । जब इन फोन से इसकी टक्कर होती है तो यह बहुत पीछे तो नहीं कहा जाएगा लेकिन आगे भी नहीं है । बहुत कम ही फोन इतने ताकतवर कैमरे के साथ उपलब्ध हैं । आउटडोर फोटोग्राफी में भी कही जा सकती है कि अच्छी है बहुत अच्छी नहीं । कीमत के लिहाज से स् बहुत अच् हैं । कैमरा क् शानदार है और बैटरी बैकअप भी आपको निराश नहीं करेगा । फोन का परफॉर्मेंस अच्छा है और कैमरा क्वालिटी भी बेहतर है । कमी सिर्फ पुराने एंडरॉयड की कही जा सकती है फोन में और एलटीई होना भी अच्छा संयोग है । जहां तक क्वालिटी की बात है तो कहा जा सकता फोन की बिल्ट अच्छी है । भारतीया बाजार में यह फोन सफेद रंग में उपलब्ध है । कनेक्टिविटी में यह फोन आगे है । मुख्य पैनल पूरा ग्लास का है वहीं पिछला पैनल भी ग्लास फिनिश ही है । डिजाइन में कमी की बात करें तो बहुत जल्दी उंग्लियों के निशान आ रहे थे और फोन बहुत जल्दी गंदा हो जा रहा था । ऐसे में बार बार इसे साफ करना होता है । इसकी सबसे खास बात यह है कि लाॅक स्क्रीन से ही आप कई फीचर को एक्सेस कर सकते हैं । फोन के दाएं पैनल में वाॅलयूम और पावर बटन दिए गए हैं । ब्लूम ग्लोब लाइट की म्यूजिक क्वालिटी अच्छी है परंतु हमे शिकायत लाउडस्पीकर के प्लेसमेंट से है । कैमरे से ली गई तस्वीर अच्छी तो नहीं है । नोकिया आशा आपकी आशाओ पर पानी फेर सकता है । पर फीचर फोन के हिसाब से यह काफी अच्छा फ़ोन है । रूपए की कीमत में काफी अच्छा मोबाइल है मोटोरोला मोटो जी । नोकिया लुमिया से ली गई फोटो और विडियो काफी अच्छी क्वालिटी की है । इस मोबाइल के स्पीकर से काफी अच्छी आवाज आती है । इन्टरनेट काफी अच्छे चलता है इसमें । इंच की स्क्रीन है इसकी और पिक्साल का रेसुलूसन है पर रंग इतने खास नहीं और धुप में इतना साफ़ नहीं दीखता । यह फोन लाजवाब है पर कई जगहों पर यह पीछे छुट जाता है जिस वजह से इस फोन के बदले हज़ार रूपए देना मुझे तो ठीक नहीं लगता । इस मोबाइल से ली गई फोटो अच्छी है और विडियो की क्वालिटी भी खूब है । स्क्रीन का कॉन्ट्रास्ट बहुत खराब है धुप में धुप में अच्छ नहीं दीखता । युवाओं को आएगा पसंद । आकर्षक डिस्पले और ओएस । जोलो का यह नया हेंडसेट एंड्रॉयड ओएस के लेटेस्ट वर्जन लॉलीपॉप पर काम करता है । युवाओं के लिए यह फोन कमजोर रैम के कारण बहुत ज्यादा उपयुक्त नहीं है । अगर आप दंाई ओर देख रहे हैे तो फोन की स्क्रीन पर चल रही एप्लीकेशन आपकी आख्ंा की मूवमेंट को दायीं तरफ फाॅलो करते हुए एप्लीकेशन को दांयी ओर ले जाएगी और आपकी आंख की पुतलियों की मूवमेंट बाईं ओर है तो एप्लीकेशन बाईं ओर चली जाएगी । यह भी देखना होगा कि वास्तव में यह फीचर कितने प्रभावी ढंग से लम्बे समय तक काम कर पाता है । सैमसंग वेव की सबसे खास बात इसका हार्डवेयर है जो कमाल का है । यह शायद सैमसंग की मोबाइल श्रेणी में अभी तक का सर्वश्रेष्ठ है । यह बाडा ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम पर आधारित है जो शायद इसकी कमज़ोर कड़ी है । सैमसंग वेव स्लिम फोन है जिसकी चौड़ाई केवल मिमी है । इसके अलावा इसमें एचडी वीडियो रिकॉर्डिंग वाईफ़ाई ब्लूटूथ जीपीआरएफ जीपीएफ और यूएसबी भी मौजूद हैं । हालांकि लो पिक्सल काउंट के कारण शायद कुछ यूजर्स को स्क्रीन उतनी आकर्षक ना लगे । जैसा की पहली स्लाइड में बताया गया है इस फोन में मेगापिक्सल के रियर कैमरा के साथ मेगापिक्सल का वाइड एंगल फ्रंट कैमरा दिया गया है । इस फोन में तक मेमोरी बढ़ाई जा सकती है । अपने स्मार्टफोन को इस हफ्ते एंड्रायड लॉलीपॉप से अपडेट करने वाला है जबकि इस मामले में गूगल के डिवाइसेज अभी पीछे हैं । पिछले कुछ सालों से एलजी को एंड्रायड अपडेट मामले में असफलता को लेकर काफी बातें बनी थीं । इस नए स्मार्टफ़ोन में एक स्टाइलिश डिजाईन है है इसके साथ ही इसकी सुंदरता इसके मेटलिक फ्रेम और फ्लैट बैक से ज्यादा बढ़ जाती है । इसके अलावाइस स्मार्टफ़ोन में का क्वाड कोर मीडियाटेक प्रोसेसर और की रैम है । इसके अलावा अगर इसकी इंटरनल स्टोरेज की बात करें तो लेनोवो के इस नए स्मार्टफ़ोन में की इंटरनल स्टोरेज मिल रही है इसके साथ ही अगर आप इसकी स्टोरेज में इजाफ़ा करना चाहते है तो आप इसे तक एक्सपैंड कर सकते हैं । इसके साथ ही यह नया स्मार्टफ़ोन ड्यूल सिम सपोर्ट के साथ आ रहा है । इसके फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा से आप बढ़िया क्वालिटी की सेल्फी और विडियो कॉलिंग कर सकते हैं । इसके साथ ही इस स्मार्टफ़ोन में ग्रेविटी सेंसर प्रोक्सिमिटी सेंसर लाइट सेंसर और असेलेरोमीटर भी है । इसके साथ ही इस नए स्मार्टफ़ोन में इंटेल एटम प्रोसेसर रैम के साथ है इसके अलावा इस फ़ोन में की इंटरनल स्टोरेज भी है जिसे आप तक एक्सपैंड कर सकते हैं । इस फ़ोन में ऑप्टिकल इमेज स्टेबिलाइजेशन के साथ मेगापिक्सेल रियर कैमरा भी है इसके कनेक्टिविटी ऑप्शन्स में ब्लूटूथ यूएसबी और वाई फाई हैं । पैनासोनिक एलुगा एल में की एचडी आईपीएस डिस्प्ले पिक्सेल रेजोल्यूशन के साथ है । इस स्मार्टफ़ोन में मेगापिक्सेल का रियर कैमरा जोकि आपको ऑटो फोकस के साथ एलईडी फ़्लैश के साथ मिल रहा है इसके साथ ही आपको इस स्मार्टफ़ोन में मेगापिक्सेल का फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा ब्लिंक प्ले टेक्नोलॉजी के साथ मिल रहा है यह कैमरा बढ़िया सेल्फी लेने में सक्षम है साथ ही आप इससे बढ़िया विडियो कॉलिंग का भी लाभ उठा सकते हैं । कैमरा सामान्य और निम्न प्रकाश की स्थितियों में बहुत अच्छी तस्वीर खींचता है । सबसे बड़ी बात तो यह है कि एलजी ने का निर्माण सुन्दर ढंग से किया है कि यह फोन आपके हथेली में आसानी से समा जाता है । मुझे गलत मत समझे यह एक बड़ा फोन है परन्तु यह इतना बड़ा भी नहीं है जितना आप एक इंच वाले स्मार्टफोन से अपेक्षा करते है । जबकि पहला रूपांतरण इसे कुछ इंच वाले स्मार्टफोन के समान बड़ा बनाता है जबकि दूसरा इसे आपकी हथेली में फिट बैठने लायक बनाता है । की एक पृथक करने वाली विशेषता इसकी क्वैड एचडी स्क्रीन है । फिंगरप्रिंट के प्रति बहुत अधिक संवेदनशील होने के कारण का डिस्प्ले थोड़ा निराश करने वाला है । हालांकि यह बहुत स्पष्ट और चमकीला स्क्रीन है फिंगरप्रिंट वास्तव में स्मार्टफोन के सूर्य के प्रकाश में देखने की क्षमता को प्रभावित करता है । इस सेगमेंट में अनेकों डिवाइस है जो सूर्य के प्रकाश में देखने की बेहतर क्षमता प्रदान करते है और यह एक ऐसा फैक्टर है जिस पर अवश्य विचार करना चाहेंगे जब आप रूपये से अधिक अपने फोन परव्यय करने जा रहे है । आप इस पर गेम खेलने और विडियो देखने का आनन्द उठा सकते है । यूआई के मोर्चे पर एलजी ने अनेकों परिवर्तन किया है फिर भी अन्य स्मार्टफोन की तुलना में कंपनी का यूआई बहुत ही साधारण है । फोन बेंचमार्क मानदंडों पर भी बेहतर प्रदर्शन करता है और मार्क आइस स्टॉर्म और आइस स्टॉर्म एक्सट्रीम टेस्ट दोनों पर बेहतर प्रदर्शन करता है । इसकी सबसे बड़ी शक्ति एमपी का रियर कैमरा है जो लेजर ऑटो फोकस से युक्त है । इसकी जाँच हमने क्स्पेरिया और जी ने सोनी से बेहतर प्रदर्शन किया का उपयोग कर आउटडोर इंडोर और कम प्रकाश में लिए गए तस्वीर का उल्लेख किया गया है । यहाँ तक कि नियमित उपयोग करने पर एक बार चार्ज करने पर आसानी से दिन भर काम करता है । वर्तमान समय में एलजी का डिजायन एंड्राइड फ्लैगशिप में सर्वश्रेष्ठ है और संभवत अपनी श्रृंखला में सर्वश्रेष्ठ है । लगभग रूपये की कीमत पर यह फोन बहुत अधिक लोकप्रिय हुआ होता परन्तु इसके बावजूद यदि आपके पास एक फ्लैगशिप स्मार्टफोन के लिए बजट है तो यह पहली अनुशंसा होगी । यह अन्य फ्लैगशिप जैसे के सोनी क्स्पेरिया सैमसंग गैलेक्सी और एचटीसी वन की तुलना में बेहतर प्रदर्शन करता है और निर्माण और अनुभव के मामले में भी अन्य फोन की तुलना में श्रेष्ठ है । ऊंची कीमत है । रंट के उपरी भाग में एक्सपीरिया जेड कॉम्पैक्ट ठीक कॉम्पैक्ट की तरह दिखता है हालांकि नजदीक से देखने पर आप पायेंगे कि डिस्प्ले का साइज अधिक है । एक बहुत ही खास और महत्वपूर्ण अपडेट्स इसके स्पीकर्स हैं जो अब डिस्प्ले के नीचे और ऊपर हैं और पहले से अधिक तेज आवाज वाले भी हैं । अब इसके किनारे अत्यंत निर्मल हैं जिसके टॉप पर मिमी का ऑडियो जैक लगा है जो कि वाटरप्रूफ है और वीडियो रिकॉ के लिए माइक भी लगा है । इसके डिस्प्ले में पी का रेजोलूशन है हालांकि स्क्रीन साइज बढ़ाया गया है फिर भी इसका डिस्प्ले तेज है और कॉम्पैक्ट के मुकाबले अधिक ब्राइट है । कॉम्पैक्ट में मिली समस्याओं को दूर करने के लिए सोनी ने प्रयास किये हैं और उन्होंने अच्छा काम किया है । हालांकि इसका पॉलिकार्बोनेट बॉडी बहुत चमकीला है और कभी कभी हाथ से फिसल जाता है यह वही समस्या है जो अधिकतर एक्सपीरिया डिवाइसेज के साथ देखी जाती है । आप यह भी देखेंगे कि इसके आइकॉन्स भी कॉम्पैक्ट के मुकाबले बड़े हैं जो एप्प्स खोलने को आसान बनाते हैं । इसके अधिकांश यूआर्इ अपने पूर्ववर्तियों के समान हैं तथा इसकी हर चीज ठीक से काम करती है । एक ब्रांड न्यू प्लेस्टेशन एप्प को भी शामिल किया गया है जो आपको प्ले स्टेशन नेटवर्क में लॉग इन करने में मदद करता है आपके प्रोफाइल में एक टैब बनाये रखता है और वेट फॉर इट आपको कनेक्ट करने तथा स्मार्टफोन पर प्लेस्टेशन गेम्स खेलने में मदद करता है । इसके बेंचमार्क स्कोर्स बहुत ही आशाजनक थे क्योंकि यह स्मार्टफोन प्रतियोगिता को दूर कर देता है । सोनी बैटरी को भी एमएएच तक बढ़ाया गया है और इस हैंडसेट को अपने पूर्ववर्तियों से हल्का बनाने का प्रबंध किया गया है । इसका कैमरा एप्प अधिक तेज और रिस्पॉन्सिव है । तेज प्रकाश की दशा में इसके पिक्चर्स बहुत ही तेज होते हैं रंग भड़कीले होते हैं और यहां तक कि ऑटो ह्वाइट बैलेंस भी बिल्कुल सटीक होता है । यदि आप स्मार्टफोन की फोटोग्राफी पसंद करते हैं तो कॉम्पैक्ट सबसे अच्छा विकल्प है । इसका डिस्प्ले बहुत ही सुधारा गया है इसका डिजाइन बहुत ही जोरदार लगता है और इसका यूआर्इ बहुत ही परिष्कृत और ताजा है । औसत परफॉर्मंस है । पॅकिंग सजीले तौर पर और बहुत ही अच्छी तरह से की हूई है । हमें कवर की क्वालिटि पसंद नहीं आई । बिल्ट क्वालिटि ना ही बहुत अच्छी है ना ही बुरी । बैक पैनल निकाला जा सकनेवाला लीड है जो रबरयुक्त फील के साथ है जिससे यह एक हाथ में पकडने के लिए मुश्किल बन जाता है क्योंकि यह आकार में भी बड़ा है । औसत परफॉर्मंस है । एक हाथ से इस्तेमाल के लिए बहुत बड़ा है । स्क्रीन और बॉडी पर धब्बे लगने की संभावना बैक कवर निकालने के बाद आपको बड़ी बैटरी बैट्री स्लॉट के उपर दो सिम स्लॉट और मेमरी एक्सपांशन स्लॉट दिखेगा । शीर्ष पर यूएसबी चार्जिंग स्लॉट और हेडफोन जॅक स्थित है । यह इंटिग्रेटेड पावरवीआर जीपीयू के साथ मीडीया टेक क्वाड कोर प्रोसेसर से संचालित है । फोन का प्रोसेसर निश्चित रूप से बाजार में सबसे तेज नहीं है लेकिन फिर भी यह अपना काम बखूबी करता है । इसमें जीबी विस्तारीत मेमरी को सपोर्ट करनेवाले मेमरी कार्ड स्लॉट के द्वारा ज्यादा मेमरी जोड़ने का पर्याय भी है । इस फोन के प्रमुख आकर्षणो में से एक है डिस्प्ले जो है इंच का फुल एचडी आइपीएस वैरायटी जिसमें पिक्सल रिजॉल्यूशन है जो पिक्सल की घनता को पीपीआइ तक लाता है जिससे स्क्रीन अच्छी शार्प दिखने में मदद मिलती है । पिछला कैमरा मेगा पिक्सल और अगला कैमरा मेगा पिक्सल का है । उंची पिक्सल घनता के कारण स्क्रीन आँखो के लिए सुखकारक है जो पढ़ने और वीडीयो देखने के लिए बहुत अच्छी है । वीडीयो पर कलर आउटपूट नैचरल दिखते है । बड़ी समस्या तो यह थी की इस मोड में फोन लगभग रूक सा गया था और इतना धीमा चलता था की वह लगभग काम के बाहर ही हो गया था । अगर आपको फोन दो हाथ से इस्तेमाल करने में कोई परेशानी नहीं हो तो यह आपके लिए समस्या नहीं है । फोन ऍण्ड्रॉइड जेली बीन आउट ऑफ द बॉक्स के साथ प्रस्तुत हुआ है जो की एक निराशा है । ओएस यह स्टॉक संस्करण है जो बिना किसी अनावश्यक समस्याओं के ऍण्ड्रॉइड का शुद्ध अनुभव देता है । फोन ओटीजी ऑपरेशन को सपोर्ट करता है और ओटीजी केबल के साथ आता है । इसका मतलब है आप अपना पेन ड्राइव गेमिंग कंट्रोलर्स और अन्य सपोर्टेड यूएसबी डिवाइसों को फोन से कनेक्ट कर सकते हैं । अगर आप इस डिवाईस पर भारी गेम खेलना चाहते हैं तो कहीं और खेलें क्योंकि यह फोन भारी गेम खेलने के लिए नहीं बना है । डिजाइन औसत ही है । इस कीमत में इतने बढ़िया कैमरे की उम्मीद नहीं की जा सकती थी । हमें इसका प्रोसेसर ज्यादा पसंद आया । प्रदान किये गए इयरफोन के साथ म्युजीक क्वालिटि बहुत कुछ खास नहीं है । बैक में मौजूद प्रमुख स्पीकर की आवाज़ साऊंड क्लॅरीटी अच्छी है लेकिन आउटपूट थोड़े हल्के दर्जे है । दिन की चमकती रोशनी में मेगा पिक्सल कैमरा अच्छे फोटोज़ लेता है लेकिन कम रोशनी में अपनी क्वालिटी छोड़ देता है । बीएसआइ सेंसरवाले मेगा पिक्सल कैमरा से जीन फोटोज़ की उम्मीद की जाती है इसके फोटो उतने शार्प नहीं है । सामान्य सेटिंग्स पर आउटपूट ग्रेनी आता है और आउटफोकस काफी खराब है । कैमरा फोटो तुरंत खिंचता है और ऑपरेशनल लॅग नहीं है । इसमें कोई भी समर्पित कैमरा की नहीं है जो इस डिवाईस के आकार को देखकर होनी चाहिए थी क्योंकि बाजूओं पर अतिरिक्त की के लिए काफी सारी जगह है । हालांकि डिवाईस से फोटो और वीडीयो लेने के लिए कोई समस्या नहीं होती । सबसे पहले तो बैट्री चार्ज होने में बहुत ज्यादा समय लेती है । जीबी की रैम क्षमता के साथ लूमिया का परफॉर्मेंस ऐसे भी बढिया था । इसके अलावे एप लोडिंग में भी थोड़ा अधिक समय लगता है जो यूजर की नापसंदगी का एक कारण बन सकते हैं । ज़ोलो काले और सफेद रंग में उपलब्ध है और कुछ प्रिलोडेड ज़ोलो ऍप्स के साथ आया है जैसे वारंटी और सपोर्ट के लिए ज़ोलो केअर ज़ोलो पावर जो की बैट्री प्रबंधन सॉफ्टवेअर है और ज़ोलो सिक्यूअर जो ऐंटी थेप्ट ऍप है जिससे आपका डिवाईस चोरी होनेपर उसका डेटा सुरक्षित रहता है । यह फोन सिर्फ एक फोन नहीं है और इसके आकार को देखते हुए यह आसानी से फॅब्लेट कहलाने के लिए पात्र है । सिर्फ एक ही क्षेत्र में यह पिछड़ता है और वह है इसका परफॉर्मंस जो उसके पुराने प्रोसेसर और जीपीयू से जुड़ा हुआ है । एक घंटे के प्लेबैक के बाद बैट्री से तक ही उतरी जो की बहुत ही जबरदस्त प्रदर्शन रहा था । उसके तुरंत बाद हमने बीच बगी ब्लिट्ज़ आधे घंटे तक लगातार चलाया और उससे बैट्री से तक उतरी । इंटरनल स्टोरेज आगे और भी बंटता है जो इसकी बड़ी कमज़ोरी बन जाती है । ज़ेडटीइ में इंच डिस्प्ले है और बनावट ज्यादातर प्लास्टिक की है और बैक निकाली जा सकती है । उसमें निकाली जा सकनेवाली बैट्री भी है जो कुछ लोगों के लिए बड़ी फायदेवाली बात हो सकती है । रेडमी से अलग ज़ेडटीइ ने ओजीएस तकनीक का प्रयोग किया है जो को रेडमी से अच्छे व्यूवींग ऐंगल्स प्रदान करता है । ज़ेडटीइ ने काला फ्रंट और सफेद बैक के जरिए स्मार्टफोन की बार डिज़ाईन को आकर्षक बनाया है । यह बढ़िया दिखता है और हाथ में आराम से बैठता है । का पिक्सल एचडी डिस्प्ले संतोषजनक है । यूआई के मोर्चे पर ज़ेडटीइ के खुद के नुबिया यूआई पर चलता है जो विजुअल एस्थेटिक्स के हिसाब से सर्वोत्तम है । लेकिन नुबिया यूआई में कुछ कमियाँ है जो मुझे अच्छी नहीं लगी । आप नोटिफिकेशन बार में जाकर बैकग्राउंड ऍप्स को रोक सकते हैं लेकिन कोई विशिष्ट ऍप बंद करने के लिए कोई तरीका नहीं है कम से कम ऐसा कोई तरीका जो तुरंत दिखाई दें । वह लॅग तो नहीं दिखाता लेकिन लोड होने में ज्यादा समय लेता है खासकर जब आप गेम खेल चुके हो और डिवाईस गरम हुआ हो । डिवाईस सिंथेटिक बेंचमार्क पर संतोषजनक रूप से प्रदर्शन करता है और गेम और अन्य भारी क्रियाकलापों के समय अच्छा प्रदर्शन करता है । गेम्स और ऍप्स इस डिवाईस पर क्रैश नहीं होते और यह आसानी से गरम भी नहीं होता । जब यह गरम होता है तब भी इतना गरम नहीं होता की इस्तेमाल में असुविधा होने लगे । इसका मेगा पिक्सल कैमरा जो इस डिवाईस का हिरो है । यह सामान्य बाहरी रोशनी में न्यूनतम नॉइस और अच्छे कलर रिप्रॉडक्शन के साथ अच्छी दिखनेवाली संतुलित तस्वीरे लेता है । हालांकी तस्वीरों की शार्पनेस में थोडी कमी नज़र आती है लेकिन इस रेंज में कम ही स्मार्टफोनो में मेगा पिक्सल कैमरा है इसके मद्देनज़र फिर भी यह अच्छा विकल्प है । इसका मतलब है आपको ना सिर्फ इस स्मार्टफोन के लिए मेमरी कार्ड खरीदना पडेगा बल्कि आपको प्राइमरी स्टोरेज को एसडी कार्ड पर बदलना पड़ेगा । प्राइमरी स्टोरेज को बदलने से कुछ ऍप्स का काम बिगड़ सकता है हमारे लिए कैमरा ऍप ने कुछ समय तक काम करना बंद कर दिया था । ज़ेडटीइ डिज़ाइन डिस्प्ले परफॉर्मंस और कैमरा विभाग में आगे है लेकिन स्टोरेज स्पेस इस स्मार्टफोन की अकीलीज़ की एड़ीयाँ है । अगर आपको इस बजट में मेगा पिक्सल कैमरा चाहिए तो माइक्रोमैक्स कैनवास नीट्रो और इंटेक्स ऍक्वा एचडी बेहतर विकल्प है । जबकि कैनवास नीट्रो में समान कैमरा है एचडी में वास्तव में इससे बेहतर कैमरा है । डिस्प्ले के व्ह्यूवींग ऐंगल अच्छे हैं । अपनी प्रतियोगीयों के मुकाबले कीमत काफी कम है । परफॉर्मंस उम्मीदों से कम है । यहाँ तक की ज़रासी छूट लेकर यह भी कह सकते हैं कि यह बाजार में उपलब्ध प्लास्टिक ढाँचेवाले फोन में सबसे अच्छा और मजबूत बनावट वाला फोन है । यह इंच का स्मार्टफोन है जिसमें वॉल्यूम रॉकर बायीं तरफ है पावर ऑन / ऑफ दायीं तरफ और हेडफोन जॅक और चार्जिंग पोर्ट क्रमश ऊपर और नीचे हैं । बॅक रबरयुक्त प्लास्टिक से बनी है जिससे डिवाइस सिर्फ प्लास्टिक का ही ना दिखकर प्रिमियम स्मार्टफोन का लूक रखता है । यह वहीं प्रोसेसर है जो माइक्रोमैक्स कैनवास नाईट और पॅनासोनिक में लगा है और जो ओक्टेन प्लस से रूपयों से महंगे हैं । हम इस डिवाईस के प्रदर्शन से पूरी तरह संतुष्ट नहीं थे और डिवाईस में कुछ लॅग्ज भी दिखें । ऍस्फाल्ट और डेड ट्रीगर जैसे गेम खेलते समय भी प्रदर्शन उम्मीदों से नीचे ही रहा जो की कम फ्रेम रेट के कारण थोड़ी मुश्किल से चल रहे थे । पांच मिनट गेम खेलने से ही डिवाईस गरम होना शूरू हो गया था । कुल मिलाकर प्रदर्शन औसतन रहा जबकि हम इस डिवाईस से काफी उम्मीद रखते थे । अगर आप अपने फोन से बहुत सारी तस्वीरें खिंचते हैं तो आप इस स्मार्टफोन को पसंद नहीं करेंगे । इसका मतलब है यह स्मार्टफोन घंटो से कम समय तक ही चलेगा जबकि स्पर्धक पॅनासोनिक ने इसी जाँच में घंटो का अच्छा प्रदर्शन किया । जैसा कि हमने पहले ही कहा है कि लूमिया सिरीज के अब तक के सभी डिवाइसेस की तुलना में लूमिया अभी भी कहीं बेहतर है । कार्बन ने टाइटेनियम ओक्टेन प्लस के लिए जिस कीमत की पेशकश की है उससे तो इस फोन में अपने प्रतिस्पर्धियों को हराने की संभावना नज़र आती है । कुल मिलाकर यह एक औसतन फोन है हालांकि कार्बन ने ढांचे की गुणवत्ता और दिखावे के मामले में बहुत ही शानदार काम किया है । अगर आपको बड़ा अच्छा दिखनेवाला डिस्प्ले चाहिए तो आप पॅनासोनिक बारे में सोच सकते हैं । खराब परफॉर्मेंस है । एलजी स्टाइलस का डिजाइन बहुत हद तक एलजी और एलजी बीट से मिलता जुलता है । अगर स्टाइलस के डिस्प्ले को इसकी बड़ी कमी कहें तो गलत नहीं होगा । की तरह एलजी का हाइली कस्टमाइज्ड यूआई स्टाइलस फैबलेट में प्रयोग किया गया है जो उपयोग में बेहद आसान है । डिवाइस टेस्टिंग मे हमने पाया कि ग्राफिक बेस्ड गेम खेलते हुए या कैमरा ऑन करते ही यह गर्म होने लगा । इतनी सारी कमियों के साथ मेगा पिक्सल का बैक कैमरा संभवत इसके सबसे अच्छे फीचर्स में है । इसके अलावे इसमें कोई एडवांस फीचर भी नहीं दिया गया है कि फोटोग्राफी पसंद करने वाले यूजर्स अपने अनुसार इसका ज्यादा से ज्यादा इस्तेमाल कर सकें । साधारण उपयोग में केवल एक बार फुल चार्जिंग के साथ हमारे टेस्ट में यह पूरे दिन चली । फ्रंट और बैक दोनों ही कैमरों की पिक्चर क्वालिटी काफी अच्छी है । परफॉरमेंस को और भी बेहतर बनाया जा सकता था । लूमिया के पास सबसे अच्छा स्मार्टफोन कैमरा था और लूमिया का बजट लोगों की पहुंच के मुताबिक था । नोकिया लूमिया की डिजाइन और बनावट बेहद मजबूत है । लॉन्च के समय से ही हरा रंग लूमिया लाइन फोन्स का ट्रेडमार्क रहा है लूमिया में भी यह मैट ग्रीन कलर देखा जा सकता है । इंच की डिस्प्ले साइज के साथ फोन कहीं भी साथ लेकर चलने के लिए एकदम फिट हो जाता है । पहला तो यह कि स्पीकर पीछे की तरफ है इसलिए म्यूजिक के लिए आपको हमेशा स्पीकर लगाने की जरूरत पड़ती है । इसमें का एचडी डिस्प्ले प्रयोग किया गया है जिसकी ब्राइटनेस इतनी कमाल की है कि तेज धूप में भी स्क्रीन देखने में आपको परेशानी नहीं होती । दूसरी तरफ विंदोज फोन डिवाइसेस की तरह लाइट व्हाइट बैकग्राउंड यूज करना आसान नहीं होगा । इसके साथ ही इसकी एक और खूबी स्क्रीन पर गोरिल्ला ग्लास का कवर होना भी है जो स्क्रीन को मजबूती देने के साथ ही इसे लूमिया का ट्रेडमार्क प्रीमियम टच भी देता है । जॉम्बि जोनर पर पहले भी फिल्म बन चुकी है । जॉम्बी जोनर में बनने वाली फिल्म ग्लैमरस तो नहीं है क्योंकि वैंपायर पर बेस्ड फिल्म होती है । हालांकि मैगी के साथ भी ऐसा हुआ है कि हॉरर के बजाए कई बार फिल्म कॉमेडी लगती है । इसलिए लय टूटती है । फिल्म की कहानी अच्छी होते हुए भी उसे ठीक से परदे पर नहीं उतारा गया है । बहुत ही डलनेस सा महसूस होता है । फैंस जो है वो इस रोल से निराश होंगे । यही इस फिल्म की सबसे बड़ी कमजोरी है । भारत और पाकिस्तावन के बीच पल रहे दुराग्रहों और पूर्वाग्रहों को तोड़ती कुछ फिल्मों की कड़ी में वेलकम कराची को भी रखा जा सकता है । दोनों देशों के बीच किरदारों के मेल मिलाप हंसी मजाक और हास्यास्पद प्रसंगों से मौजूद तनाव को कम करने के साथ समझदारी भी बढ़ सकती है । कई बार फिल्में पन्नों से पर्दे तक आने में बिगड़ जाती हैं । हिंदी फिल्म इंडस्ट्री के बेपरवाह रवैए की ओर भी यह फिल्म इंगित करती है । हर फिल्म के निर्माण में पैसा मेहनत और समय लगता है । ऐसी कोशिशों में सब व्यर्थ हो जाता है । उनसे कुछ ऐसा हो जाता है कि उन्हें पाकिस्तान पहचान भी मिलती है । गलतफहमी की इस निर्दोष यात्रा में हंसी के पल आते हैं । वे तुरंत किसी फूहड़ एवं हास्यास्पद स्थिति का सृजन कर जबरन हंसाने की कोशिश करते हैं । फिल्म में मोड़ से अधिक मरोड़ हैं जो एक समय के बाद तकलीफदेह हो जाते हैं । अरशद वारसी अपनी काबिलियत से भी फिल्म को नहीं बचा पाते । केदार को गुजराती लहजा देने का आइडिया अच्छा था लेकिन कलाकार को भी मेहनत करनी चाहिए थी । यंगिस्तान से जैकी भगनानी ने उम्मीए जगाई थी । इस फिल्म से वह उम्मीद धुल गई । वेलकम कराची उसका भी नमूना है । एक बार जो मैंने कमिटमेंट कर दी फिर मैं अपने आप की भी नहीं सुनता ... पर्दे पर सलमान खान के बोले इस पॉपुलर संवाद को तनु वेड्स मनु रिटर्न्स तवेमरि में मनोज शर्मा उर्फ मनु अपने अंदाज में फेरबदल के साथ बोलते हैं तो पप्पू टोकता है कि तुम क्या सलमान खान हो इस फिल्म को देखते हुए उत्तर भारत के दर्शक थोड़ा सा हंसेंगे क्योंकि शब्दक संवाद और मुहावरे उनकी रोजमर्रा जिंदगी के हैं । शहरी दर्शकों का आनंद अलग होगा । तवेमरि सीक्वल है । पहली फिल्म तनु वेड्स मनु की कहानी आगे बढ़ती है । दीपक डोबरियाल एक दो दृश्यों कुछ ओवर एक्टिंग करते नजर आते हैं । मुश्किल और जटिल दृश्यों में भी वे अपने किरदार को एक्सरप्रेशन की आजादी नहीं देते । सब कुछ ऐसा नपा तुला और संयमित है कि मनोज शर्मा वास्तविक से लगने लगते हैं । उनके वनलाइनर तो मजेदार हैं । पुरानी कहानी के विस्तार में दत्तो के आगमन से नाटकीय मोड़ आता है । पटकथा का हिस्सा बना दिया है । बच्चे की यह लाइन कि हमें तो मजबूत होना ही पड़ता है । इन बातों के बाद भी कलाकारों का काम ठीक ठाक है । बावजूद इसके ऐसी फिल्में लगातार बनती रहती हैं । बावजूद इसके यह फिल्म बहुत लंबी लगने लगती है । फिल्म में विजुअल इफेक्ट्स अच्छे हैं । कुछ हिस्से अच्छे भी है । कारण कि कुल मिलाकर फिल्म आपको निराश करती है । टुमारोलैंड का निर्देशन किया है ब्रेड बर्ड ने । जब इस बात की घोषणा पहली बार की गई थी तो दर्शकों को बताया गया कि यह फिल्म एक वैज्ञानिक पर आधारित है । कारण कि फिल्म को लेकर उम्मीदें बहुत थी । यदि आपको लगता है कि यह कुछ ठीक है तो आप अकेले नहीं है । ब्रेड बर्ड फिल्म होने के बावजूद टुमारोलैंड अपने आपको डिज्नी मूवी होने से रोकती प्रतीत होती है । फिल्म अच्छी दिखती है । बर्ड के डायरेक्शन में परफेक्शन है इस बात में कोई संदेह नहीं है । बावजूद इसके फिल्म के कुछ दृश्य ऐसे हैं जो दर्शकों का मनोरंजन करते दिखाई देते हैं । हां मगर इतना जरूर है कि जिन लोगों ने पहले की फिल्में देखी हैं वे इस फिल्म में डरने के लिए इंतजार करते दिखाई देते हैं । कारण कि सही मुद्दों को सही तरीके से डील किया गया है । बाद में बॉक्स ऑफिस पर अच्छा प्रदर्शन करने के लिए इसे सुरक्षित सांचे में ढ़ालने की कोशिश की गई है । फिल्म बहुत ही गंभीरता के साथ शुरू होती है । कहानी कमजोर पड़ जाती है । साथ ही निराशानजक भी है कारण कुछ बातें अविश्वसनीय सी लगती है । इस पूरे मसले में अवैधानिक तौर पर रहना और जाने का मसला कहीं खोकर रह जाता है । बावजूद इसके स्टार कास्ट ने अपने स्तर पर अच्छा काम किया है । मगर फिल्म और भी अच्छी बन सकती थी । आमतौर पर किसी भी सीक्वल के आने में तीन सालों का इंतजार लंबा समय होता है । उन्होंने ब्लॉकबस्टर फिल्म के स्टैंडर्ड का ध्यान रखा है । दूसरा जब कभी भी सीक्वल बनता है तो एक चुनौती उनके बीच तालमेल बैठाने की भी होती है । एवरेज एंजॉय के लिए एज ऑफ अल्ट्रॉन को पता है कि लोग क्या चाहते हैं । दमदार एक्शन सुपरहीरोज की कलाकारी और तो और रोमांटिक ट्रेक भी । ये एक बड़ा एक्शन पीस है । ये हिस्सा एकदम सांस रोक देने वाला है । इसके बाद जो होता है वो बहुत ही साधारण है । ये बाकी सभी एवेंजर्स से मजबूत भी बताया गया है । एक्शन कमाल का है । हल्क और आयरनमैन के बीच की टसल कमाल की है । मार्वल फैंस के लिए ये एक शानदार ट्रीट है । ये सबकुछ आपको ऐसा महसूस कराता है मानो आप अपनी फेवरेट कॉमिक्स पढ़ रहे हों । इस फिल्म में हमें पता होता है कि हीरो की जीत होने वाली है और विलेन हारने वाला है । मगर इसमें इस किरदार के बारे में किसी तरह की कोई बात नहीं की गई है । इस फिल्म को थ्री डी में देखने के लिए तो बिलकुल ना है । इसलिए इस फिल्म का मजा लेने के लिए टूडी एक बेहतर विकल्प है । इधर कुछ उनसे बिछुड़े और कुछ अलग हो गए बड़े बेटे ईशान को आकस्मिक तरीके से खोने के बाद वह खुद के अंतस में उतरीं । वहां सहेज कर रखे संबंधों को फिर से झाड़ा पोंछा । इस फिल्म में शोनाली की मौजूदगी सोच और समझदारी के स्तर पर है । उन्होंने लैला के बहाने संबंधों और भावनाओं की परतदार कहानी रची है । समस्या यह है कि हमारा समाज उन्हें मरीज और बोझ मानता है । हर किरदार के साथ कहानी एक नया मोड़ लेती है और रिश्तों का नया आयाम दिखा जाती है । कल्कि ने इस किरदार को आंतरिक रूप से पर्दे पर जीवंत किया है । सेरेब्रल पालसी की वजह से किरदार की गतिविधियों में आने वाली स्वाभाविक भंगिमाओं को जज्ब करने के साथ ही उन्होंने उसकी मानसिक क्षमताओं को भी सुंदर तरीके से जाहिर किया है । रेवती ने मां की ममता और भावना के बीच सुंदर संतुलन बिठाया है । ऐसे किरदार को पर्दे पर उतारना सहज नहीं होता । हां उनका व्यस्क होना जरूरी है । भारतीय समाज में अभी समलैंगिकता की सही समझ विकसित नहीं हुई है । वह कहीं भी समझाने और सुधारने की मुद्रा में नहीं दिखतीं । विक्रम भट्ट निर्देशित इमरान हाशमी की मिस्टर एक्स फिल्म है । साथ ही एक नयापन है कि फिल्म का नायक अदृश्य हो जाता है । विक्रम भट्ट तकनीक में दक्ष हैं । फिल्म पुराने ढर्रे पर चलती है । दर्शक इस फिल्म की पूरी कहानी का अनुमान लगा सकते हैं । सब कुछ प्रेडिक्टेबल और सरल है । कभी कढ़ाई सुघड़ हो जाती है तो दर्शक फिल्म पसंद कर लेते हैं । मिस्टर एक्स से ऐसी उम्मीद नहीं की जा सकती । इमरान हाशमी का जादू बेअसर हो चुका है । सिया की भूमिका में अमायरा दस्तूर कमजोर हैं जबकि उन्हें कुछ अच्छे दृश्य मिले हैं । तिवारी की छोटी भूमिका में आया कलाकार अपनी बेवकूफियों में अच्छा लगता है । पॉपुला सिंगर अंकित तिवारी भी निराश करते हैं । और हां इस फिल्म में हर किरदार भारद्वाज को भरद्वाज क्यों बुलाता है बेहतर होगा कि वे ऐसे चमत्कारिक दबावों से बचें । जब आप फिल्म देखने बैठते है तो धीरे धीरे इससे बंधते चले जाते हैं और आगे जाकर आपको समझ आता है कि देश की न्याय व्यवस्था में कैसे पेंच हैं । डेब्यूटेंट डायरेक्टर चेतन्य ताम्हणे ने इसके साथ ही यह भी बताया है कि हर दिन कोर्टरुम में किस तरह की जद्दोजहद होती है । एक व्यक्ति को न्यायिक प्रक्रिया से कैसे जूझना पड़ता है । फिल्म में नूतन और जज सदावर्ते के मिडिल क्लास जीवन को भी दिखाया गया है जो अपनी सीमित सोच के बूते इस मामले पर चर्चा भी करते हैं । आत्मविश्वास से भरे डायरेक्शन में दिल को छूती हुई एक मजबूत कहानी है फिल्म कोर्टरुम की । यह वास्तविक फिल्म है जो आपको जरूर महसूस होगी । इसलिए यह फिल्म एक बेहतरीन हॉरर फिल्म है । इसका बहुत सारा श्रेय तो इस बात को जाता है कि किरदारों का परिचय किस तरह से कराया गया है । मसलन एक किरदार है जो के दशक का लगता है । दूसरा जो है वो के दशक का लगता है । ब्रोकन हॉसेस के माध्यम से फिल्ममेकर विधु विनोद चोपड़ा ने एक बोल्ड अटैंप्ट लिया था मगर दुर्भाग्यवश यह फेल होता दिखाई देता है । ब्रोकन हॉर्सेस वर्ष में आई क्लासिक फिल्म परिंदा की रीमेक है । इसे चोपड़ा ने अपने साथी अभिजीत जोशी के साथ हॉलीवुड की पृष्ठभूमि पर फिर से लिखा है । यह फिल्म नए मैक्सिको की पृष्ठभूमि पर आधारित है । मूल फिल्म में कुछ बातें जो बहुत ही अच्छी थी उन्हें इस फिल्म में अपडेट नहीं किया गया । इसका नतीजा यह है कि जब आप फिल्म देखते हैं तो आपको लगता है कि इसमें बड़ा लॉजिकल गैप है । फिल्म की धीमी गति इसमें किसी तरह की मदद नहीं करती बल्कि और कमियों को उजागर कर देती है । फिल्म में कई पहलूओं को उठाने की बात हुई मगर बाद में उसे छोड़ दिया गया । जूलियस का किरदार भी फिल्म में सही तरीके से बाहर नहीं लाया गया । मसलन आप फिल्म में अंत तक नहीं जान पाएंगे कि आखिर जैकब और उसके पिता को गोली मारी किसने थी । जूलियस के मन में बडी को लेकर ऐसी भावना क्यों थी । वो उन्हें गैंग क्यों नहीं छोड़ने देना चाहता । कुछ भी अंत में निकलकर सामने नहीं आता । यदि आप परिंदा के फैन हो तो आपके दिल को थोड़ी निराशा हो सकती हैं । टिम जॉनसन ने फिल्म होम का निर्देशन किया है । होम की कहानी बहुत ही रोचक है । ड्रीमवर्क्स की एनिमेटेड फिल्मों में सेलीब्रेटिज की आवाज होना ही इन फिल्मों की पहचान होती है । इस बार भी ऐसा ही हुआ है । रिहाना जेनिफर लोपेज स्टीव मार्टिन और जिम पार्सन जैसे सेलेब्स ने अपनी आवाज दी है । पार्सन ने अपनी आवाज लीड रोल को दी है जो कि एकदम फीट बैठी है । फिल्म में पॉप सांग्स के साथ कई जोक्स भी है । एनिमेशन अपने आप में ही खूबसूरत होता है अगर वो में न हो । फिल्म में एक शानदार सीक्वेंस है जहां टीप और ओह भाग रहे हैं और एफिल टॉवर कोलेप्स हो रहा है । फिल्म का अंत सरप्राइज करते हुए प्रभावी बन पड़ा है । फिल्म फ्रेंडशिप और लव का मैसेज देती है । ओवरऑल यह एक प्यारी फिल्म है जो कि विशेष रूप से बच्चों के लिए बनी है । यहां भी धर्म और धार्मिकता के पहलू को एक अलग नजरिए से उठाया गया है । फिल्म के नायक या मुख्य अभिनेता परेश रावल हैं । धर्म संकट में ब्रिटिश कॉमेडी फिल्म द इनफिडेल से स्पष्ट रूप से प्रेरित है । और उन्होंने धर्मपाल के किरदार को अच्छी तरह निभाया है । निर्देशक फुवाद खान ने भारतीय संदर्भ में यहूदी और मुसलमान चरित्रों की मूल कहानी को हिंदी और मुसलमान चरित्रों में बदल दिया है । उन्होंने मुसलमानों के बारे में प्रचलित धारणाओं और मिथकों पर संवेदनशील कटाक्ष किया है । हालांकि वे गंभीर मसले पर खुद को केंद्रित करते हैं लेकिन निर्वाह और वर्णन में सतह पर ही रहते हैं । शायद तह में जाने पर विवाद और विरोध हो सकता था । फुवाद खान का यह प्रयास सराहनीय है । वे दोनों धर्मां में मौजूद कठमुल्लापन पर निशाना साधने में सफल रहे हैं । ऐसी फिल्मों की प्रासंगिकता कलात्मकता या सिनेमाई कौशल से अधिक वास्तविकता से होती है । ऐसी फिल्में एक स्तर पर समाज में फैला भ्रमजाल तोड़ती हैं । फुवाद खान ने सलीके से अपनी बात कही है और किसी भी धर्म के नागरिक को आहत नहीं किया है । हिंदी फिल्मों के इतिहास में इस विषय पर अनेक फिल्में बनी हैं कि इंसान पैदाइशी अच्छा या बुरा नहीं होता । उसके हालात और परवरिश ही उसके वर्तमान के कारण होते हैं । परेश रावल की तरह अन्नू कपूर ने भी अपने किरदार को सही तरीके से निभाया है । हां अन्नू कपूर कभी कभी अपनी अभिनय शैली के दोहराव के मोह में फंस जाते हैं । नसीरूद्दीन शाह ने नील आनंद बाबा की भूमिका में मस्ती की है । शरदिंदु बनर्जी ने में जासूस ब्योमकेश बक्शी के किरदार को गढ़ा था । उन्होंने कुल कहानियां लिखी थीं । इन कहानियों को बंगाल में फिल्मों और धारावाहिकों में ढाला गया है । हिंदी में भी एक धारावाहिक ब्योमकेश बक्शी नाम से ही बना था जिसमें रजत कपूर ने शीर्षक भूमिका निभाई थी । ताजा हाल रितुपर्णो घोष की बंगाली फिल्म सत्यान्वेषी मे ब्योमकेश बक्शी की भूमिका में कहानी के निर्देशक सुजॉय घोष दिखे थे । दिबाकर बनर्जी ने शरदिंदु बनर्जी की सभी कहानियों के अधिकार लेकर उन्हें अपनी फिल्म डिटेक्टिव ब्योमकेश बक्शी में सुविधानुसार इस्तेमाल किया है । दिबाकर बनर्जी की यह फिल्म यशराज फिल्म्स के सहयोग से आई है । इसमें ब्योमकेश बक्शी की भूमिका सुशांत सिंह राजपूत निभा रहे हैं । डिटेक्टिव ब्योकेश बक्शी के आरंभ में फिल्म का प्रमुख सहयोगी किरदार अजीत बंद्योपाध्याय का वॉयसओवर सुनाई पड़ता है । दिबाकर को वास्तविक लोकेशन के साथ सेट की भी सुविधा रही है । उनकी टीम की कोशिश पीरियड दिखने से अधिक उस परिवेश को सिरजने की रही है जिसमें ब्योमकेश अजीत अनुकूल गुहा अंगूरी देवी आदि किरदार विचरते हैं । इसे निकोस एंड्रिटसेकिस ने थीम के अनुकूल रंगो और शेड्स कैमरे में कैद किया है । जासूसी फिल्मों की उत्सुकता तो बनी रहती है लेकिन खोज की गति धीमी हो जाती है । हल्का भटकाव नजर आता है । उन्होंने नायक ब्योमकेश समेत सभी किरदारों के लिए हनी त्रेहन की मदद से उपयुक्त कलाकार खोजे हैं । सुशांत सिंह राजपूत उम्दा अभिनेता के तौर पर उभर कर आते हैं । उनके अभिनय की शैली में मधुर ठहराव और औचकपन है । उन्होंने ब्योमकेश को जबरन किसी मैनरिज्म में नहीं ढाला है । समुचित मेकअप और कॉस्ट्यूम से उनका किरदार निखरता है । अजीत की भूमिका में आनंद तिवारी सहज हैं । वे ब्योमकेश का पूरा साथ देते हैं । अंगूरी देवी की भूमिका में स्वास्तिका मुखर्जी प्रभावित नहीं कर पातीं । सत्यवती की छोटी भूमिका में दिव्या मेनन जंचती हैं । फिल्म की खासियत है कि सभी सहयोगी और छोटे किरदारों पर निर्देशक और उनकी टीम ने ध्यान दिया है । योमकेश बताता है कि वह भागलपुर मुंगेर से आया है । बाद में दो धोतीधारी सुरक्षाकर्मी भी आते हैं जो भागलपु मुंगेर के हैं । ब्योमकेश उनसे गंवई भाषा में बात करता है । अफसोस कि दिबाकर की टीम ने उनकी भाषा भोजपुरी प्रभावित कर दी है । ऐसा लगता है कि फास्ट एंड फ्यूरियस के तीसरे हिस्से के बाद वाले जितने भी सीक्वल आए हैं वो अंत तक आते आते कमजोर पड़ जाते हैं । डायरेक्टर जस्टिन लिन ने हर किसी को आश्चर्यचकित किया है । सीक्वल के ट्रेंड को बदला है । एक अच्छी बात निकलकर सामने आई है जो और में नहीं थी । इन फिल्मों में कोई मजबूत कहानी नहीं थी मगर स्टंट के भरोसे फिल्म चल रही थी । जेम्स वान सॉ के डायरेक्टर रहे हैं । उनके लिए इस फिल्म का सातवां सीक्वल बनाना एक तरह से उनके लिए अजीब पसंद था । बावजूद इसके उन्होंने निराश नहीं किया । फिल्म को जिस उत्साह की जरूरत थी वान ने उस चीज को फिल्म में डाला । फिल्म में जो महत्वपूर्ण है वो है एक्शन और स्टंट सीन । इन सीन्स में ट्रकलोड्स का इस्तेमाल किया गया है । मगर ऊंची ईमारतों से कूदती कार और पहाड़ियों के बीच दौड़ते ये ट्रक आपको हैरान कर देते हैं । आप इन सभी बातों से बोर होने ही वाले होते हैं कि इतने में इन कारों पर ड्रोन से मिसाइले दागी जाती है । यह सबकुछ किसी को मनोरंजन तो किसी को कुछ अजीब सकता है । केवल एक बात ही है जो इस फिल्म के लिए बुरी है और वो ये कि यह है । एक्शन का हर सीन हिलते हुए कैमरे के साथ में देखना किसी का भी सिर दुखा सकता है । कम लाइट में शूट किए गए कुछ सीन भी दिक्कत का कारण बन सकते हैं क्योंकि से देखते समय इमेज और भी मद्दम हो जाती है । इसके अलावा फिल्म जो कुछ भी दिखाती है अच्छा है । इसमें दिवंगत पॉल वॉकर को गुड बाय भी शामिल है । निर्देशक जैगम इमाम ने अपने ही लिखे उपन्यास दोजख पर बनाई है यह फिल्म और इसका टाइटल भी इसके नाम पर ही रखा है दोजख इन सर्च ऑफ हेवेन । मगर वह इस उपन्यास की दिल छू लेने वाली कहानी को पर्दे पर दमदार तरीके से दिखने में उतने सफल नहीं रहे हैं । निर्देशक जैगम इमाम ने एक अच्छी फिल्म बनाने की कोशिश तो की है मगर अभी उन्हें फिल्म निर्माण के कई पहलुओं को समझने की जरूरत है । इंटरवल से पहले फिल्म की रफ्तार काफी सुस्त है । इसके साथ ही खराब एडिटिंग बेवजह के बैकग्राउंड म्यूजिक दर्शकों को परेशान करते हैं । हालांकि इंटरवल के बाद फिल्म रफ्तार पकड़ती है लेकिन बाकी की खामियां साफ झलकती हैं । जसपिन्दर कौर निर्देशित दिल्लीवाली जालिम गर्लफ्रेंड का उद्देश्य दिल्ली की पृष्ठभूमि में खोसला का घोंसला जैसी हल्की फुल्की और सटायर फिल्म बनाने का रहा होगा । लेखक मनु ऋषि चड्ढा ने कुछ किरदारों को लेकर यह कहानी रची है । उन्होंने ध्रुव को केंद्र में रखा । अनावश्यक तरीके से कुछ गाने जोड़ दिए जाते हैं । लेखक निर्देशक इस गलतफहमी में रहते हैं कि दर्शकों का मनोरंजन हो रहा है जबकि ऐसी फिल्मों में कुछ दृश्यों के बाद ही जी उचट जाता है । फिल्म सलीके की न हो तो फिर बांध नहीं पाती । लेखक निर्देशक की ईमानदार कोशिश भी फिजूल हो जाती है । हाई स्कूल के दिनों में किशोर अपनी खास पहचान और स्टाइल के लिए अलग अलग तरीके से बाल कटवाते हैं । इस भूमिका में जैकी श्राॅफ अनफिट लगते हैं । पंजाबी लहजे में बोलते हुए वे नकली लगते हैं । नवदीप सिंह और अनुष्का शर्मा की एनएच पर सेंसर की कैंची चली है । कई गालियां अपशब्द कट गए हैं और कुछ प्रभावपूर्ण दृश्यों को छोटा कर दिया गया है । इस कटाव से अवश्य ही एनएच के प्रभाव में कमी आई होगी । एनएच हिंदी फिल्मों की मनोरंजन परंपरा की फिल्म नहीं है । यह सीधी चोट करती है । दर्शक सिहर और सहम जाते हैं । फिल्म में हिंसा है लेकिन वह फिल्म की थीम के मुताबिक अनगढ़ जरूरी और हिंसक है । चूंकि इस घात प्रतिघात में खल चरित्रों के साथ नायिका भी शामिल हो जाती है तो अनेक दर्शकों को वह अनावश्यक और अजीब लग सकता है । नायिका के नियंत्रण और आक्रमण को आम दर्शक स्वीकार नहीं कर पाता है । दरअसल प्रतिशोध और प्रतिघात के दृश्यों के केंद्र में नायकपुरुष हो तो पुरुष दर्शक अनजाने ही खुश और संतुष्ट होते हैं । नवदीप सिंह और उनकी टीम ने फिल्म को धूसर रंग दिया है । इलाके की कठोर और नंगी सच्चाई को उभारने और जताने के लिए इस फिल्म के शिल्प में चमक नहीं रखी गई है । दिल्ली की रंगीनी और चमक गुड़गांव पार करने के साथ खत्म हो जाती है । पूरी फिल्म में हम असहज होने के बावजूद बंधे रहते हैं । हमें मीरा के पति के व्यवहार बेवकूफाना और गैरजरूरी लगता है क्योंकि हम कहानियों और फिल्मों में भी मुश्किलों के लिए तैयार नहीं हैं । एनएच इंडिया और भारत की सच्चाई को कभी आमने सामने तो कभी समानांतर खड़ी कर देती है । हो सकता है कि शहरी दर्शक ऐसी सच्चाईयों से अकुलाहट महसूस करें । आरंभ के कुछ दृश्यों के बाद ही हम मीरा के साथ हो जाते हैं । दर्शन कुमार ने अपने चरित्र को पूरी क्रूरता के साथ निभाया है । उन्हें संवाद कम मिले है फिर भी अपनी मौजूदगी और अदायगी से वे प्रभावित करते हैं । मीरा के पति के रूप में भूपलम की भूमिका सीमित है । मामा और मां के किरदार में रवि झांकल और दीप्ति नवल उपयुक्त है । बिहारी दंपत्ति की छोटी सी भूमिका में आए दोनों अपरिचित कलाकार नैचुरल और रियल हैं । एनएच मुख्य रूप से अनुष्का शर्मा की फिल्म है । उन्होंने लेखक निर्देशक से मिले मौके का भरपूर इस्तेमाल किया है । उन्होंने मीरा की मजबूरी और बहादुरी तक के आयामों को संजीदगी से निभाया है । बतौर निर्माता ऐसी फिल्म के लिए तैयार होने की उनकी पहल की भी तारीफ करनी चाहिए । उनके समर्थन में खड़ी कृषिका लु्ल्ला का योगदान भी सराहनीय है । बदमाशियां एक अपरिपक्व हास्यापद फिल्म है जिसे देखते हुए आप अपना सिर पीटने लगेंगे कि हो क्या रहा है । यहां तक कि फिल्म देखने के बाद भी यह सवाल आपका पीछा नहीं छोड़ेगा कि यह फिल्म बनाई ही क्यों गई इस फिल्म में बकवास दृश्यों को एक दूसरे के साथ अजीबोगरीब तरीके से पिरो दिया गया है । यहां तक कि इस फिल्म के कलाकारों की एक्टिंग ऐसी है कि लगता है वे नशे में जरुरत से ज्यादा ऊर्जावान है और उनका उत्साह चिढ़ानेवाला है । इस फिल्म की स्क्रिप्ट को देखकर महसूस होता है कि कुछ दृश्यों में निर्देशक ने बेहतरीन काम किया है लेकिन बाकी दृश्य इतने फूहड़ है कि सब पर पानी फिर गया है । ऐसा लगता है कि पहली बार निर्देशन में कदम रख रहे अमित खन्ना ने अपनी फिल्म में किसी उपन्यास की तरह दर्शकों को भौंचक्का रखने पर काफी जोर दिया है लेकिन वह सुरुचिपूर्ण नहीं है । यहां भी उन्होंने कोरियाई फिल्म व्हाटएवर की नकल करने की कोशिश की है । इंटरवल के बाद शारिब हाशमी की एक्टिंग से फिल्म थोड़ी रफ्तार पकड़ती है । लेकिन आगे जाकर वे अपनी घटिया एक्टिंग से फिल्म पर पानी फेर देते हैं । और हां करण मेहता ने इस फिल्म में जो जासूस की भूमिका निभाई है उन्होंने जरुर ठीक ठाक एक्टिंग की है । लेकिन उनकी मेहनत इस घटिया फिल्म में खो जाती है । इसलिए इस फिल्म से तो आप बच कर ही रहें । अगर आप दो घंटे के लिए एक शानदार अनुभव में खो जाना चाहते हैं तो दम लगा के हईशा जरुर देखें । इस फिल्म में दिखाया गया है कि खूबसूरती वो नहीं होती जो हमें आंखों से नजर आती है । यह बहुत ही खूबसूरत फिल्म है जिसमें दिल को छू लेने वाली कहानी है । फिल्म के हर कलाकार ने उम्दा अभिनय किया है । फिल्म के गाने संगीत माहौल डॉयलॉग सब कुछ कमाल का है । इन सबसे भी ज्यादा प्रभावशाली है फिल्म का निर्देशन । बड़ी ही खूबसूरती से फिल्म की कहानी आगे बढ़ती है और संध्या के व्यक्तित्व के छुपे पहलूओं को सामने लाती है । इस फिल्म की कहानी हरिद्वार और ऋषिकेश के घाटों के आसपास बुनी गई है । यह फिल्म हमें दिखाती है कि कोई फिल्म कितनी सादगी और खूबसूरती से बनाई जा सकती है । फिल्म के निर्देशक शरद कटारिया की सबसे बड़ी उपलब्धि यह है कि उन्होंने हरिद्वार और बनारस की संस्कृति के साथ ही वहां के लोगों की मानसिकता को भी बहुत ही अच्छी तरह पेश कर पाए । उन्होंने इस बात का भी ध्यान रखा है कि फिल्म की भाषा बिल्कुल वास्तविक लगे । साथ ही फिल्म में बेहद मनोरंजक तरीके से हास्य का तानाबाना भी बुना गया है । के दशक के संगीत और उस दौर के सबसे मशहूर गायक कुमार शानू को फिल्म के कई दृश्यों में याद किया गया है । नई अभिनेत्री भूमि पेडनेकर ने संध्या के किरदार में जान डाल दी है । शायद ही कोई और उनके जैसी खूबसूरती व सादगी से इस भूमिका को निभा पाता । इस फिल्म की कास्टिंग लाजबाव है जिसका श्रेय कास्टिंग डाइरेक्टर शानू शर्मा को जाता है । उनकी इस बात के लिए खासतौर से तारीफ की जानी चाहिए कि इस फिल्म में उन्होंने फिल्म इंडस्ट्री के सबसे प्रतिभाशाली कलाकारों का चयन किया । यकीनन यह बॉलीवुड की रोमांटिक कॉमेडी में अब तक की सबसे बेहतरीन फिल्म है । दम लगा के हईशा धीरे धीरे आपके दिल में उतरती है और सिनेमा हॉल से निकलने के बाद भी आप फिल्म आपके मन में बसी होती है । इस फिल्म की सबसे खास बात यह है कि इस फिल्म देखने के बाद अाप यकीनन अपने जीवन में उनलोगों को महत्व देना शुरू कर देंगे जिनकी आप उपेक्षा करते रहते हैं । श्रीराम राघवन की बदलापुर हिंदी फिल्मों के प्रचलित जोनर बदले की कहानी है । इस हिस्से में घटनाएं तेजी से घटती हैं । फिल्म की गति धीमी नहीं पड़ती । श्रीराम राघवन पहले ही फ्रेम से दर्शकों को सावधान की मुद्रा में बिठा देते हैं । अच्छी बात है कि टर्न और ट्विस्ट लगातार बनी रहती है । वरुण धवन अपेक्षाकृत नए एक्टर हैं । उनकी मेहनत जाहिर है । उन्होंने रघु के बदलते भावों को व्यक्त करने में अच्छी खासी मेहनत की है । दूसरी तरफ नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी की फितरत प्रभावित करती है । वरुण की मेहनत और नवाज की फितरत से बदलापुर रोचक और रोमांचक हुई है । वरुण सधे अभिनेता नवाज के आगे टिके रहते हैं । नवाज हमारे समय के सिद्ध अभिनेता हैं । यह फिल्म वरुण और नवाज के अभिनय के लिए याद रखी जाएगी । फिल्म में महिला किरदारों को सीमित स्पेस में ही पर्याप्त महत्व दिया गया है । उन्हें अच्छी तरह गढ़ा गया है । पांचों महिला किरदारों ने अपनी भूमिकाओं को संजीदगी से निभाया है । प्रभावशाली दृश्य राधिका आप्टे और हुमा कुरैशी को मिले हैं । यों दिव्या दत्ता प्रतिमा कण्णन और यामी गौतम लेश मात्र भी कम असरदार नहीं हैं । कुमुद मिश्रा की सहजता और स्वाभाविकता उल्लेखनीय है । श्रीराम राघवन ने बदले की रोमांचक फिल्म को नया ट्विस्ट दे दिया है । बहुत कम फिल्में ऐसी होती हैं जो आरंंभ से अंत तक दर्शकों को बांध ही न पाएं । विक्रमजीत सिंह की रॉय ऐसी ही फिल्म है । साधारण फिल्मों में भी कुछ दृश्य गीत और सिक्वेंस मिल जाते हैं जिसे दर्शकों का मन बहल जाता है । रॉय लगातार उलझती और उलझाती जाती है । हालांकि इसमें दो पॉपुलर हीरो हैं । रणबीर कपूर और अर्जुन रामपाल का आकर्षण भी काम नहीं आता । ऊपर से डबल रोल में आई जैक्लीन फर्नांडीस डबल बोर करती हैं । आयशा और टीया में बताने पर ही फर्क मालूम होता है या फिर रणबीर और अर्जुन के साथ होने पर पता चलता है कि वे दो हैं । हिंदी फिल्म इंडस्ट्री के बैकड्रॉप पर बनी रॉय इंडस्ट्री की गॉसिप इमेज ही पेश करती है । रॉय की सबसे कमजोर कड़ी जैक्लीन फर्नांडीस हैं । उन्होंने नाच गाने में भरपूर ऊर्जा दिखाई है । अभिनय से अभी वह कोसों दूर हैं । अर्जुन रामपाल और रणबीर कपूर समर्थ अभिनेता हैं । निर्देशक ने इस फिल्म में उनके सामर्थ्य का उपयोग गैरजरूरी समझा है । दोनों ने बेपरवाही के साथ काम किया है । अन्य दिक्कते भी हैं । अर्जुंन रामपाल की दाढ़ी चिपकाई हुई दिखती है । रॉय के रूप में रणबीर कपूर भी खोए खोए से हैं । दोनों एक समय के बाद नीरस और अप्रभावी हो जाते हैं । फिल्म की थीम के हिसाब से सलेटी रंग चुना गया है लेकिन वह अधिक काम नहीं आ पाता । निर्देशक और लेखक ने पटकथा पर अधिक मेहनत नहीं की है । कुछ नया करने और दिखाने के चक्कर में फिल्म फिसल गई है । फिल्म के गाने ठीक ठाक हैं । उनकी लोकप्रियता से कुछ दर्शक भले ही आ जाएं । फिल्म में एक संवाद है कि जो बात समझ में नहीं आती वह सुनाई भी नहीं पड़ती । उसी तर्ज में कहें तो जो दृश्य समझ में नहीं आते वे दिखाई भी नहीं पड़ते । षमिताभ अनोखी व प्रयोगवादी किस्सागोई करने को मशहूर फिल्मकार आर. बाल्की की फिल्म है । षमिताभ की कहानी एक गूंगे शख्स की है जो हिंदी फिल्म इंडस्ट्री का सुपरस्टार बन जाता है । षमिताभ बड़ी खूबसूरती से हिंदी फिल्मकारों व सितारों की लकीर के फकीर वाली सोच व कार्यप्रणाली पर करारा प्रहार कर जाती है । वह माइंडलेस मसाला फिल्मों पर तंज कसते हुए उन्हें आड़े हाथों लेती है । फिल्म में अमिताभ बच्चन के असल जिंदगी से जुड़े अनुभव भी हैं । वे अपनी दमदार संवाद अदायगी से बताते हैं कि पार होने के बावजूद उनमें अब भी काफी ऊर्जा और उत्साह बाकी है । अब यह फिल्मकारों पर निर्भर करता है कि वे उनके किन शेड्स को उभार और बाहर निकाल पाने में सक्षम है । धनुष ने अपने किरदार से अमिताभ बच्चन की बुलंद आवाज और चेहरे पर हाव भाव को ठीक ठाक तौर पर कैरी किया है । अक्षरा हासन इस फिल्म से अपना डेब्यू कर रही हैं । उन्होंने असिस्टेंट डायरेक्टर यानी एडी की भूमिका का निर्वहन किया है । वे बड़ी स्वीट लगी हैं लेकिन उन्हें अपनी अदाकारी पर अभी और काम करना होगा । फिल्म का निर्देशन असाधारण है । आर. बाल्की ने मिनट लंबी फिल्म को बोझिल नहीं होने दिया है । उन्होंने परिस्थितियों का ताना बाना बेहद रोचक और तार्किक बुना है । फिल्म में अभिनेत्री रेखा को सीन पर ला अमिताभ बच्चन की आवाज बोलने वाले शख्स को बेस्ट एक्टर दिलवाने का आइडिया अनोखा और खूबसूरत बन पड़ा है । स्वानंद किरकिरे ने अपनी प्रतिष्ठा के मुताबिक सीन को आगे बढ़ाने में मदद करने वाले गाने लिखे हैं । इलैयाराजा का संगीत कर्णप्रिय है । पीसी श्रीराम की सिनेमैटोग्राफी उम्दा है । विभु पुरी निर्देशित हवाईजादा पीरियड फिल्म है । संक्षिप्त साक्ष्यों के आधार पर विभु पुरी ने शिवकर तलपड़े की कथा बुनी है । ऐसा कहा जाता है कि शिवकर तलपड़े ने राइट बंधुओं से आठ साल पहले मुंबई की चौपाटी में विश्व का पहला विमान उड़ाया था । अंग्रेजों के शासन में देश की इस प्रतिभा को ख्याति और पहचान नहीं मिल पाई थी । सालों के बाद विभु पुरी की फिल्म में इस हवाईजादा की कथा कही गई है । बोलचाल पहनावे और उपयोगी वस्तुओं के उपयोग में सावधानी नहीं बरती गई है । हां सेट आकर्षक हैं पर सब कुछ बहुत ही घना और भव्य है । ऐसे समय में जब स्पेस की अधिक दिक्कत नहीं थी इस फिल्म को देखते हुए व्यक्ति और वस्तु में रगड़ सी प्रतीत होती है । अतीत की ऐसी कथाएं किसी भी देश के इतिहास के संरक्षण और वर्तमान के लिए बहुत जरूरी होती हैं लेकिन उन्हें गहरे शोध और साक्ष्यों के आधार पर फिल्म की कहानी लिखी है । शिवकर तलपड़े और उनके सहयोगी चरित्र थोड़े नाटकीय और कृत्रिम लगते हैं । सनकी वैज्ञानिक शास्त्री का किरदार ऐसा ही लगता है । फिल्म में ही दिखाया गया है कि वेदों और ऐतिहासिक ग्रंथों के आधार पर शास्त्री ने वैमानिकी की पुस्तक तैयार की थी फिर उस पुस्तक के आधार पर विमान बनाने और उड़ाने का श्रेय अकेले शिवकर तलपड़े को देना उचित नहीं लगता । विभु पुरी अपनी सोच और ईमानदारी से उन्नीसवीं सदी के अंतिम वर्षों का माहौल रचते हैं । इसमें उनके आर्ट डायरेक्टर अमित रे ने भरपूर सहयोग दिया है । उन्होंने पीरियड को वर्तमान संदर्भ दिया है लेकिन उसकी वजह से तत्कालीन परिस्थितियों के चित्रण में फांक रह गई है । उन्नीसवीं सदी की मुंबई की बोली और माहौल रचने में भी फिल्म की टीम की मेहनत सराहनीय है । कलाकारों में आयुष्मान खुराना ने शिवकर तलपड़े की चंचलता और सनकी मिजाज को पकडऩे की अच्छी कोशिश की है । कहीं कहीं वे किरदार से बाहर निकल जाते हैं । शास्त्री के रूप में मिथुन चक्रवर्ती कृत्रिम और बनावटी लगते हैं । पीरियड फिल्म में उनका उच्चारण और लहजा आड़े आ जाता है । पल्लवी शारदा कुशल नृत्यांगना हैं । उनके अभिनय के बारे में यही बात नहीं कही जा सकती । बाल कलाकार नमन जैन प्रभावित करते हैं । उनकी मासूमियत और संलग्नता प्रशंसनीय है । हवाईजादा में गीतों के अत्यधिक उपयोग से कथा की गति बाधित होती है । नायक के समाज प्रेम और प्रयोग का द्वंद्व चलता रहता है । शिमित अमीन की अब तक छप्पन में आई थी । उस फिल्म में नाना पाटेकर ने साधु आगाशे की भूमिका निभाई थी । उन्होंने अभिनय में यथार्थ लाने की सफल कोशिश की । अभिनय का रियलिरूट तरीका अब सूक्ष्म और सरल हो गया है । नाना को अगली पीढ़ी के अभिनेताओं में इरफान खान मनोज बाजपेयी और नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी को देखने की जरूरत है । ये तीनों हिंदी सिनेमा में अभिनय के तीन भिन्न आयाम हैं । अब तक छप्पन में सिर्फ नाना ही नहीं बाकी सारे अभिनेता भी नाना जमाने की एक्टिंग कर रहे हैं । यहां तक की गुल पनाग भी इस प्रभाव से नहीं बच पाई हैं । फिल्म की घटनाओं का अनुमान पहले से हो जाता है । नाना के होने के बावजूद फिल्म निराश करती है । स्थितियां बदल चुकी हैं । मुंबई के माहौल में अंडरवर्ल्ड और एनकाउंटर अब सुर्खियों के शब्द नहीं हैं । फिल्मों के साथ समाज ने भी भ्रष्ट नेताओं को एक्सपोज किया है । भ्रष्टाचार के मामले में बड़े नेता बिजनेश मैन और समाज के कथित सम्मानित व्यक्ति जेल की सजा काट रहे हैं । उनके खिलाफ मुकदमे चल रहे हैं । इस पृष्ठभूमि में आई अब तक छप्पन अप्रासंगिक और बचकाना प्रयास लगती है । पटकथा और अभिनय में सामंजस्य नहीं है । दोनों का ढीलापन दो घंटे से छोटी फिल्म में भी ऊब पैदा करता है । मनीष गुप्ता की रहस्य हत्या की गुत्थियों को सुलझाती फिल्म है जिसमें कुछ कलाकारों ने बेहतरीन परफॉर्मेंस की हैं । उन कलाकारों की अदाकारी और लंबे समय तक हत्या का रहस्य बनाए रखने में कामयाब निर्देशक की सूझ बूझ से फिल्म में रोचकता बनी रहती है । अगर पटकथा और चुस्त रहती तो यह फिल्म किसने की होगी हत्या जोनर की सफल फिल्म होती । लंबे समय के बाद आशीष विद्यार्थी हिंदी सिनेमा के पर्दे पर आए हैं । समर्थ अभिनेता अपनी मौजूदगी के लिए संवादों का मोहताज नहीं होता । ऐसा लगता है कि फिल्म सीमित बजट में जल्दबाजी में बनाई गई है । दृश्यों की तारतम्यता अनेक जगहों पर टूटती है । कुछ दृश्यों के बाद उनमें दोहराव आने लगता है । भट्ट कैंप की खामोशियां नए निर्देशक करण दारा ने निर्देशित की है । उन्हें दो नए कलाकार गुरमीत चौधरी और सपना पब्बी दिए गए हैं । उनके साथ अली फजल हैं । कहानी विक्रम भट्ट ने लिखी है और एक किरदार में वे स्वयं भी मौजूद हैं । ऐसा लगता है कि अभी तक भट्ट कैंप अपनी फिल्मों में जिन मसालों का इस्तेमाल करता रहा है उनकी बची खुची और मिस्क मात्रा करण को दे दी गई है । प्रस्तुति और स्वभाव में भट्ट कैंप की यह फिल्म उनकी पिछली फिल्मों से कमजोर है । इस बार भट्ट कैंप अपनी एक्सपेरिमेंट देने में चूक गया है । सस्पेंस मर्डर हॉरर भूत प्रेत सेक्स रोमांस और प्रेम जैसे सभी तत्वों के होने के बावजूद यह फिल्म प्रभावित नहीं करती । कारण स्पष्ट है कि लेखक निर्देशक की विधा और प्रस्तुति के प्रति स्पष्ट नहीं है । कथा बढऩे के साथ छिटकती रहती है और आखिरकार बिखर जाती है । किरदारों में केवल कबीर अली फजल पर मेहनत की गई । मीरा सपना पब्बी और जयदेव गुरमीत चौधरी आधे अधूरे रचे गए हैं । खामोशियां का लोकेशन सुंदर है । दक्षिण अफ्रीका में कश्मीर रच दिया गया है । फिल्म में गीतों के फिल्मांकन पर पूरा ध्यान दिया गया है । गीत संगीत के चुनाव में भट्ट बंधु हमेशा सफल रहते हैं । उनकी फिल्मों के गीत लोकप्रिय होते हैं । खामोशियां में भी यही बात हुई है । फिल्म देखते हुए लगता है कि गानों के म्यूजिक वीडियो से एक लचर कथा को जोड़ा गया है । भूत आत्मा प्रेम ओर आकर्षण की खामोशियां में तर्क खामोश ही रहते हैं । यह फिल्म प्रेम और विश्वास से अधिक अंधविश्वास पर टिकी हुई है । ऐसी फिल्मों में मंत्र जाप और उपचार का मनगढ़ंत उपयोग किया जाता है । लेखक निर्देशक तथ्यों और साक्ष्यों पर गौर नहीं करते । खामोशियां में ऐसी लापरवाहियों की अति हो गई है । कलाकारों में अली फजल अपनी सीमाओं में कबीर को निभाते हैं । उन्हें अपने अभिनय में प्रवाह पर ध्यान देना चाहिए । इस फिल्म के प्रचार में गुरमीत चौधरी के नाम का शोर मचाया गया लेकिन फिल्म में उन्हें बहुत कम स्पेस और फुटेज मिला है । इनमें से भी आधे दृश्यों में वे अचेत लेटे रहते हैं । सपना पब्बी अपने किरदार मीरा की जरूरतों को पूरा नहीं कर पातीं । खामोशियां का गीत संगीत पॉपुलर रुचि का है । यों फिल्म की कथा से उसका अधिक तालमेल नहीं है । लंबे समय के बाद ... जी हां लंबे समय के बाद एक ऐसी फिल्म आई है जो हिंदी फिल्मों के ढांचे में रहते हुए स्वस्थ मनोरंजन करती है । इसमें पर्याप्त मात्रा में रहस्य और रोमांच है । अच्छी बात है कि इसमें इन दिनों के प्रचलित मनोरंजक उपादानों का सहारा नहीं लिया गया है । बेबी अपने कथ्य और चित्रण से बांधे रखती है । निर्देशक ने दृश्यों का अपेक्षित गति दी है जिससे उत्सुकता बनी रहती है । बेबी आतंकवाद की पृष्ठभूमि पर बनी फिल्म है । ऐसी फिल्मों में देशभक्ति के जोश में अंधराष्ट्रवाद का खतरा रहता है । नीरज पांडे ऐसी भूल नहीं करते । यह वैसे जांबाज अधिकारियों की कहानी है जिनके लिए यह कार्य किसी कांफ्रेंस में शामिल होने की तरह है । फिल्म के नायक अजय अक्षय कुमार और उनकी पत्नी के बीच के संवादों में इस कांफ्रेंस का बार बार जिक्र आता है । नीरज पांडे का उद्देश्य राजनीतिक और सामाजिक फिल्म बनाने का नहीं है लेकिन विवेक और समझदारी हो तो संदर्भ और परिप्रेक्ष्य में ये तत्व आ जाते हैं । बेबी आतंकवाद पर बनी एक समझदार फिल्म है । एक एक कर उनकी धड़ पकड़ से अजय और उसकी टीम मुख्य ठिकाने और सरगना तक पहुंचती है । नीरज पांडे ने मुख्य आतंकवादी तक पहुंचने की व्यूह रचना और घटनाक्रम में पर्याप्त उत्सुकता बनाए रखी है । क्लाइमेक्स के मिनट में नीरज पांडे की पकड़ दिखती है । छोटे छोटे दृश्यों से स्थितियां बनती हैं और उत्सुकता बढ़ती जाती है । नीरज पांडे का दृश्य विधान प्रेडिक्टेबल नहीं है । अनुमान से अलग किरदारों का व्यवहार चौंकाता है । क्लाइमेक्स दृश्यों में हल्का दोहराव आता है जो अधिकांश दर्शकों के लिए हंसी का कारण हो सकता है । क्लाइमेक्स में अजय और शुक्ला अनुपम खेर की नोंक झोंक तनाव ढीला कर राहत देती है । कह सकते हैं कि नीरज पांडे अपनी प्रस्तुति में परिपूर्णता के करीब पहुंच जाते हैं । किरदारों के गठन और कलाकारों के चयन में निर्देशक और कास्टिंग डायरेक्टर की सूझ बूझ फिल्म को सही रूप देती है । विकी सदाना की कास्टिंग उल्लेखनीय है । छोटे छोटे दृश्यों में भी समर्थ अभिनेताओं की मौजूदगी कथ्य गाढ़ा करती है । ड्रामा का घनत्व बढ़ाती है । अक्षय कुमार फिल्म की लीड भूमिका में जंचे हैं । एक्शन दृश्यों में उनकी गति और स्फूर्ति उल्लेखनीय है । बेबी का एक्शन धूलउड़ाऊ और कांचतोड़ू नहीं है लेकिन वह पर्याप्त असर डालता है । एक दृश्य में प्रिया सूर्यवंशी तापसी पन्नू और वसीम सुशांत सिंह के बीच की भिड़ंत उल्लेखनीय है । हिंदी फिल्मों में महिला किरदारों को नाजुक दिखाने की परंपरा रही है । हां प्रिया भिड़ती है और नायक अजय के आने तक उसे सुला चुकी होती है । डैनी डैंजोग्पा मधुरिमा तुली मुरली शर्मा सुशांत सिंह जमील खान और अनेक अपिरिचित चेहरे अपने अभिनय से किरदारों को विशेष रंग देने के साथ विश्वसनीय बनाते हैं । नीरज पांडे की बेबी आतंकवाद पर बनी एक समझदार फिल्म है । अतिरकों से बचती हुई यह पूरी ईमानदारी से एक्शन और ड्रामा के साथ थ्रिल पैदा करती है । बेबी दर्शनीय है । अभिषेक डोगरा और उमाशंकर सिंह की लिखी कहानी पर अभिषेक डोगरा निर्देशित डॉली की डोली ऊपरी तौर पर एक लुटेरी दुल्हन की कहानी लगती है लेकिन लेखक निर्देशक के संकेतों पर गौर करें तो यह परतदार कहानी है । लेखक और निर्देशक उनके विस्तार में नहीं गए हैं । उनका उद्देश्य हल्का फुल्का मनोरंजन करना रहा है । वे अपने ध्येय में सफल रहे हैं क्योंकि सोनम कपूर के नेतृत्व में कलाकारों की टीम इस प्रहसन से संतुष्ट करती है । लेखक निर्देशक आदर्श और उपदेश के भार से नहीं दबे हैं । डॉली की डोली पूरी तरह से सोनम कपूर की फिल्म है । खूबसूरत के बाद एक बार फिर सोनम ने साबित किया है कि अगर ढंग की स्क्रिप्ट और किरदार मिले तो वह अपनी सीमाओं के बावजूद फिल्म को रोचक बना सकती हैं । सोनम कपूर के हास्य में एक शालीनता है । वह हंसी मजाक के दृश्यों में भाव मुद्राओं या संवादों से फूहड़ नहीं होतीं । निश्चित ही लेखक निर्देशक की मदद से वह ऐसा कर पाती हैं । डॉली की डोली के मुश्किल दृश्यों में उनका संयम और आत्मविश्वास दिखता है । अन्य कलाकारों में राजकुमार राव ने गन्ना किसान सोनू सहरावत की भूमिका में अभिभूत किया है । हरियाणवी किरदार को उन्होंने भाषा संवाद अदायगी और अपने हाव भाव से जीवंत कर दिया है । नए नए अमीर बने हरियाणवी किसान की ठस को बहुत खूबसूरती से वे आत्मसात करते हैं । मनोज की भूमिका में वरुण शर्मा भी प्रभावित करते हैं । उनका जोर हंसाने पर रहा है इसलिए कई बार वह जबरन प्रतीत होता है । सहयोगी कलाकारों में मोहम्मद जीशान अयूब और मनोज जोशी स्वाभाविक हैं । दादी की भूमिका निभा रही प्रौढ़ अभिनेत्री याद रह जाती हैं । पुलकित सम्राट के अभिनय में सलमान खान की छाया खटकती है हालांकि उन्होंने अपने अंदाज और अदायगी पर मेहनत की है । डॉली की डोली में कथ्य की नवीनता नहीं है लेकिन परिचित कथ्य को ही अभिषेक डोगरा और उमाशंकर सिंह ने रोचक तरीके से पेश किया है । छोटे छोटे दृश्यों के जोड़ से गति बनी रहती है जिन्हें संवादों की पींग मिलती रहती है । लेखक निर्देशक ने अपना काम जिस ईमानदारी और ध्येय से किया है उसे सही तरीके से तकनीकी टीम और कलाकारों ने पर्दे पर उतारा है । कलाकारों की संवाद अदायगी में उच्चारण की स्पष्टता गौरतलब है । फिल्में में कथ्य और विषय वस्तु के तौर पर कोई नयापन नहीं है । फिर भी निर्देशक अमित रवींद्रनाथ शर्मा की प्रस्तुति रोचक है । नए कलाकारों की वजह से उत्सुकता बनी रहती है । यों लगता है कि निर्माता की तरफ से निर्देशक को स्पष्ट निर्देश है कि उन्हें एक मेकविलीब मसालेदार फिल्म में अर्जुन कपूर को फिट करना है । अमित इस निर्देश और जिम्मेदारी को बखूबी निभाते हैं । वे अर्जुन को नाचते गातेे मस्ती करते जोखिम उठाते निडर भाव से विलेन से टकराते और नायिका के साथ प्रेम करते दिखाते हैं । माना जाता है कि किसी हीरो को अगर दर्शक इन अदाओं में पसंद कर लेते हैं तो वह पॉपुलर हो जाता है । यह दर्शकों को भरपूर आनंद देगी । तेवर में निर्देशक अमित रवींद्रनाथ शर्मा ने अर्जुन कपूर और सोनाक्षी सिन्हा को पारंपरिक मसाला फिल्म के ढांचे में ही कुछ नया कर दिखाने के अवसर दिए हैं । अर्जुन कपूर भरोसेमंद एक्टर स्टार के तौर पर उभरते हैं । उन्होंने फिल्म में खुद का सलमान खान का फैन बताया है । तेवर में वे वास्तव में सलमान खान के फंस के बीच अपनी पैठ बनाने की सफल कोशिश करते हैं । सच कहें तो मनोज बाजपेयी की मौजूदगी ने फिल्म को नया आयाम दे दिया है । वे अपने अंदाज से फिल्म को घिसे पिटे माहौल से बाहर निकाल लाते हैं । तेवर में देसी टच है । पिछले दिनों साउथ की रीमेक के तौर पर बनी अन्य फिल्मों से यह इसी कारण भिन्न प्रभाव डालती है । कहानी उत्तर भारत की लगती है । इसमें थिएटर के ही चार से अधिक कलाकार है । उनके सान्निध्य में अर्जुन कपूर और सोनाक्षी सिन्हा की बोली भी निखर गई है । तेवर में सुब्रत दत्ता पर नजर टिकती है । वे दी गई भूमिका में प्रभावित करते हैं । महेन्द्र मेवाती भी छोटी भूमिका में असरदार हैं । इसी प्रकार अनुभवी राज बब्बर अपनी भूमिका में जंचते हैं । इस बार तो वे अपनी जमीन के किरदार में थे । फिल्म के गीत संगीत में ब्रज की शैली और संस्कार की ध्वनियों की कमी खलती है । कुछ गीत तो असंगत और अनावश्यक हैं । और अंत में तेवर हिंदी सिनेमा की उस शैली की फिल्म है जिसमें गाल पर गुलाल लगा देने से पहचान छिप जाती है । इसके बावजूद अमित शर्मा की बारीकी ध्यान खींचती है । फिल्म अग्ली के इस शीर्षक गीत को चैतन्य की भूमिका निभा रहे एक्टर विनीत कुमार सिंह ने लिखा है । फिल्म निर्माण और अपने किरदार को जीने की प्रक्रिया में कई बार कलाकार फिल्म के सार से प्रभावित और डिस्टर्ब होते हैं लेकिन उनमें से कुछ ही भूमिका निभाने की उधेड़बुन को यों प्रकट कर पाते हैं । दरअसल इस गीत के बोल में अनुराग कश्यप की फिल्म का सार है । फिल्म के थीम को गीतकार गौरव सोलंकी ने भी अपने गीतों में सटीक अभिव्यक्ति दी है । अग्ली की कुरूपता समझने के लिए इन गीतों को फिल्म देखने के पहले या बाद में सुन लें तो पूरा नजरिया और संदर्भ मिल जाएगा । निश्चित ही अग्ली अनुराग कश्यप की अलहदा फिल्म है । यहां वे चित्रण विवरण और प्रस्तुति में मुखर हैं । वे बेलाग तरीके से हमारे समय कसैले अनुभवों को स्थितियों और घटनाओं की तरह पेश करते हैं । उनके प्रोडक्शन डिजाइनर और कैमरामैन ने रंग और परिवेश से फिल्म के कथ्य को गढ़ा और प्रभावशाली बना दिया है । कलाकारों के चयन और और उनके अभिनय में अनुराग कश्यप ने हिंदी फिल्मों की परिपाटी का पालन नहीं किया है । यथार्थ की जमीन पर खड़े किरदारों का सभी कलाकारों ने मजबूती से पेश किया है । राहुल भट्ट तेजस्विनी कोल्हापुरी और रोनित रॉय ने प्रमुख किरदारों के तनाव और उलझन को समुचित मात्रा में आत्मसात और प्रस्तुत किया है । छोटी भूमिका में सिद्धांत कपूर ध्यान खींचते हैं । इस फिल्म की उपलब्धि हैं विनीत कुमार सिंह और गिरीश कुलकर्णी । अपने किरदार से विनीत का एकात्मता का नतीजा है फिल्म का टाइटल गीत । गिरीश कुलकर्णी अपनी निर्दोष सादगी से इंस्पेकटर जाधव को असली रंग देते हैं । पीके आज के समय की जरूरी फिल्म है । राजकुमार हिरानी और अभिजात जोशी का संदेश स्पष्ट है कि अलग अलग भगवान के मैनेजर बने स्वामी बाबा गुरु मौलवी और पादरी वास्तव में डर का आतंक फैला कर अपना उल्लू सीधा कर रहे हैं । राजकुमार हिरानी और अभिजात जोशी की कथा पटकथा सामाजिक विसंगति और कुरीति की गहराइयों में उतर कर विश्लेषण और विमर्श नहीं करती । वह सतह पर तैरते पाखंड को ही अपना निशाना बनाती है । पीके एक धर्महीन समाज की वकालत करती है लेकिन वह ईश्वर की अदृश्य सत्ता से इंकार नहीं करती । फिल्म यहीं अपने विचारों में फिसल जाती है । वैज्ञानिक सोच और आचार व्यवहार के समर्थक किसी भी रूप में ईश्वर की सत्ता स्वीकार करेंगे तो कालांतर में फिर से विभिन्न समूहों के धर्म और मत पैदा होंगे । वैचारिक स्तर पर इस कमी के बावजूद पीके मनोरंजक तरीके से कुछ फौरी और जरूरी बातें करती है । भेद और मतभेद के मुद्दे उठाती है । उनके समाधान की कोशिश भी करती है । राजकुमार हिरानी और अभिजात जोशी ने खूबसूरती से पीके की दुनिया रची है जिसमें भैंरो और जग्गू जगत जननी जैसे किरदार हैं । नयापन उनके किरदार पीके में है जो कोई मिल गया में जादू के रूप में आ चुका है । पीके की विचित्रता ही मौलिकता है । पटकथा अनेक स्थानों पर कमजोर पड़ती है । कहीं उसकी क्षिप्र गति तो कहीं उसकी तीव्र गति से मूल कथा को झटके लगते हैं । सरफराज और जग्गू के बीच प्रेम की बेल तेजी से फैलती है फिर सरफराज परिदृश्य से गायब हो जाते हैं । यह किरदार हमें प्रभावित करता है । ऐसे किरदारों की खासियत है कि वे दिल को छूते हैं । फिल्म के अंतिम दृश्य में सहयात्री के रूप में आए रणबीर कपूर भी उतने ही जंचते हैं । तात्पर्य यह कि हिरानी और जोशी की काबिलियत है कि पीके में आमिर खान की प्रतिभा निखरती है । जग्गू की भूमिका में अनुष्का निराश नहीं करतीं । वह सौंपी गई भूमिका निभाकर ले जाती हैं । सरफराज की छोटी भूमिका में आए सुशांत सिंह राजपूत में आकर्षण है । फिल्म का गीत संगीत थोड़ा कमजोर है । इस बार स्वानंद किरकिरे और शांतनु मोइत्रा जादू नहीं जगा पाए हैं । अन्य गीतकारों में अमिताभ वर्मा और मनोज मुंतजिर भी खास प्रभावित नहीं करते । पीके पर फिल्माए गाने अतिरंजित और अनावश्यक हैं । ईश्वर की खोज का गाने से अधिक प्रभावपूर्ण उसके बाद का स्वगत संवाद है । अपने कथ्य और संदर्भ के कारण महत्वपूर्ण भोपाल ए प्रेयर फॉर रेन संगत और वस्तुनिष्ठ दृष्टिकोण के साथ भोपाल गैस ट्रैजेडी का चित्रण करती तो प्रासंगिक और जरूरी फिल्म हो जाती । सन् में हुई भोपाल की गैस ट्रैजेडी पर बनी यह फिल्म सदी के जानलेवा हादसे की वजहों और प्रभाव को समेट नहीं पाती । रवि कुमार इसे उस भयानक हादसे की साधारण कहानी बना देते हैं । प्रभु देवा ने फिल्म वांटेड से हिंदी फिल्मों में कदम रखा तभी टोक देना चाहिए था । वे रीमेक बना रहे हों या कथित ऑरिजिनल कहानी चुन रहे हों । उनकी फिल्में एक निश्चित फॉर्मूले पर ही चलती हैं । उनकी फिल्मों में एक्शन वायलेंस डांस रोमांस ... इन चार तत्वों का अनुपात और क्रम बदलता रहता है । कथानक पटकथा और संवाद जैसी चीजें तो भूल ही जाएं । प्रभु देवा शब्दों से ज्यादा दृश्यों में यकीन करते हैं । उनकी फिल्मों में स्क्रिप्ट राइटर से बड़ा योगदान कैमरामैन साउंड रिकॉर्डिस्ट कोरियोग्राफर एक्शन डायरेक्टर और हीरो का होता है । एक्शन जैक्सन जैसी फिल्में देखते समय अजय देवगन सरीखे कद्दावर और लोकप्रिय अभिनेता की बेचारगी का एहसास होता है । जख्म तक्षक अपहरण और भगत सिंह जैसी फिल्मों को थोड़ी देर के लिए भूल भी जाएं तो इस अभिनेता ने कमर्शियल फिल्मों के रेगुलर हीरो के रूप में अपनी आंखों से किरदारों का दर्द बयान किया है । मनोरंजक फिल्में दी हैं । उम्र बढऩे के साथ लोकप्रियता और कामयाबी बरकरार रखने के लिए अजय देवगन ने अपनी सोच समझ को ताक पर रख दिया है । एक्शन जैक्सन उनके प्रशंसकों के लिए भी मनभंजक फिल्म है । प्रभु देवा और अजय देवगन की एक्शन जैक्सन उनके प्रशंसकों को भी निराश करेगी । मनोरंजन का कोई तुक और आधार तो होना चाहिए । और फिर ऐसी क्रूर एवं हिंसक फिल्म को यू / ए सर्टिफिकेट देने का क्या तर्क हो सकता है । सस्पेंस थ्रिलर रोमांस और सेक्स को मसालों की तरह इस्तेमाल करती जिद एक जर्मन फिल्म की रीमेक है । जेम्स क्रिस्प की द गुड नेबर पर आधारित यह फिल्म हिंदी में सायकोलॉजिकल थ्रिलर के तौर पर आरंभ हुई थी जो रिलीज होते होते ऐरोटिक थ्रिलर बन गई । हली फिल्म के लिहाज से दोनों ने बेहतरीन प्रदर्शन किया है । करण में एक ठहराव है । मनारा इस फिल्म में अनगढ़ लगी हैं । कुछ दृश्यों में वे संलग्न दिखती हैं तो कुछ दृश्यों में वह मिसफिट हो जाती हैं । श्रद्धा दास भी अपेक्षाकृत नई अभिनेत्री हैं । इन तीनों की वजह से फिल्म में ताजगी है । वह ताजगी अगर कथ्य में भी उतर पाती तो फिल्म अधिक प्रभावशाली हो जाती । लेखक निर्देशक ने सस्पेंस रचा है । फिल्म के गीत संगीत में मधुरता और शब्दों की भावुकता है । गीतकार शकील आजमी और तोषी शारिब की संगत प्रभावशाली है । जेड प्लस कंटेंट प्रधान फिल्म है । मौलिक और इनोवेटिव कहानियों की कंगाली के मौजूदा दौर में जेड प्लस फिल्मकारों और दर्शक दोनों के लिए उम्मीद और प्रेरणा की किरण है । यह रामकुमार सिंह की कहानी पर आधारित और डॉ. चंद्रप्रकाश द्विवेद्वी निर्देशित राजनीति पर तंज कसती आला दर्जे की मौलिक सटायर फिल्म है । यह सिस्टम नौकरशाही और आम आदमी के संबंध समीकरण की गूढ़ पड़ताल करती है । फिल्म का एकमात्र कमजोर पक्ष उसका असरहीन गीत संगीत है । सुखविंदर सिंह और नायब का संगीत मौजूदा कालखंड के मिजाज को छूने में नाकाम रही है । फिल्म की एडिंटिंग और कसी हुई हो सकती थी । कथानक में कोई नायक नहीं है । एक समूह ही इसका नायक है लेकिन उस समूह के विभिन्न चरित्रों को गढऩे में अधिक मेहनत नहीं की गई है । यही वजह है कि इमरान हाशमी कंगना रनौत और रणदीप हुड्डा जैसे समर्थ कलाकार भी कोई प्रभाव नहीं छोड़ पाते । इमरान हाशमी और कंगना के प्रेम प्रसंग पर भी लेखक निर्देशक ने अधिक ध्यान नहीं दिया है । इन दिनों हर तरह की फिल्मों में एक्टर की इमेज को संवादों और दृश्यों में डालने का चलन बढ़ा है । बैड बॉय और सीरियल किसर के रूप में विख्यात इमरान हाशमी फिल्म के किरदार निखिल के साथ न्याय नहीं कर पाते । फिल्म का आइटम सॉन्ग पटकथा में चिप्पी की तरह है जिसका फिल्मांकन प्रभावशाली नहीं है । श्रद्धा कपूर डांस बसंती आइटम सॉन्ग में निराश करती हैं । फिल्म का गीत संगीत प्रभावशाली नहीं है । हिंदी फिल्में अपने मसाले और फॉर्मूले के लिए मशहूर हैं । कहा और माना जाता है कि रियल लाइफ में जो नहीं हो सकता वह सब हिंदी फिल्मों में हो सकता है । हैप्पी एंडिंग इन्हीं मसालों और फॉर्मूलों का मजाक उड़ाती हुई खत्म होती है । राज और डीके अभी तक थ्रिलर फिल्में निर्देशित करते रहे हैं । इस बार उन्होंने रोमांटिक कॉमेडी बनाने की कोशिश की है । संबंध भेद विच्छेद और संवेद की यह फिल्म स्त्री पुरुष रिश्तों में कथित आधुनिकता से आए असमंजस की कहानी लेकर चलती यह फिल्म हिंदी फिल्मों के घिसे पिटे दृश्यों का ऊपरी तौर पर मजाक उड़ाती है लेकिन वैसे ही दृश्यों में रमती है । हैप्पी एंडिंग में हिंदी फिल्मों का एक स्टार अरमान भी है जो अपनी नई फिल्म के लिए नई कहानी चाहता है । कलाकारों में सैफ अली खान अपने एक्टिंग जोन में लौटे हैं । कंफ्यूज किरदारों को वे पर्दे पर अच्छी तरह उतारते हैं । इलियाना डिक्रूज ने अपने किरदार को संयम और शालीनता के साथ निभाया है । वह लगातार इम्प्रूव कर रही हैं । कल्कि कोचलिन अच्छी अभिनेत्री हैं पर इस भूमिका में वह नहीं जंच पायी हैं । फिल्म के एक आकर्षण गोविंदा हैं वे अपनी अदाओं से मुग्ध करते हैं । डायरेक्टर ने उन्हें कम नचाया होता तो उनका सही उपयोग हो जाता । फिल्म का मजेदार पक्ष है अंग्रेजी में उपन्यास लिख रहे और विदेश में बसे भारतीय लेखकों का हिंदी बोलना । हम सभी जानते और शिकायत करते हैं कि हिंदी फिल्मों के कलाकार और तकनीशियन भले ही हिंदी में फिल्में बनाते हों लेकिन उनके संपर्क और व्यवहार की भाषा अंग्रेजी है । यहां उनका लेखन प्रकाशन और समाज अंग्रेजी का है लेकिन वे हिंदी बोलते हैं और हिंदी में गाने गाते हैं । लेखक निर्देशक को पता होना चाहिए कि ऐसी विसंगति के साथ रची गई कहानी दर्शकों से कनेक्ट नहीं करती । अगर ये किरदार मुंबई या दिल्ली के होते तो कहानी विश्वसनीय लगती । फराह खान और शाह रुख खान की जोड़ी की तीसरी फिल्म हैप्पी न्यू ईयर आकर्षक पैकेजिंग का सफल नमूना है । पिता के साथ हुए अन्याय के बदले की कहानी में राष्ट्रप्रेम का तडका है । नाच गाने हैं । शाहरुख की जानी पहचानी अदाएं हैं । साथ में दीपिका पादुकोण अभिषेक बच् सोनू सूद बोमन ईरानी और विवान शाह भी हैं । सभी मिलकर थोड़ी पूंजी से मनोरंजन की बड़ी दुकान सजाते हैं । इस दुकान में सामान से ज् सजावट है । एक समय के बाद दर्शकों के धैर्य की परीक्षा होने लगती है । कला में यथास्थिति बनाए रखने के हिमायती दरअसल फिल्म को एक व्यवसाय के रूप में ही देखते हैं । हैप्पी न्यू ईयर का वितान व्यावसायिक उद्देश्य से ही रचा गया है । अफसोस है कि इस बार फराह खान इमोशन और ड्रामा के मामले में भी कमजोर रही है । उन्होंने फिल्म की पटकथा में इसी संभावनाओं को नजरअंदाज कर दिया है । किरदारों की बात करें तो उन्हें भी पूरे ध्यान से नहीं रचा गया है । चार्ली के बदले की यह कहानी आठवें नौवें दशक की फिल्मों का दोहराव मात्र है जो तकनीक और वीएफएक्स से अधिक रंगीन चमकदार और आकर्षक हो गया है । कलाकारों में शाह रुख खान ऐसी अदाकारी अनेक फिल्मों में कर चुके हैं । वास्तव में यह फिल्म उनकी क्षमताओं का दुरुपयोग है । फराह खान ने अन्य कलाकारों की प्रतिभाओं की भी फिजूलखर्ची की है । दीपिका पादुकोण ने मोहिनी के किरदार में चार छह मराठी शब्दों से लहजा बदलने की व्यर्थ कोशिश की है । बाद में डायरेक्टर और एक्टर दोनों लहजा भूल जाते हैं । अभिषेक बच् डबल रोल में हैं । उन्होंने फिल्म में पूरी मस्ती की है । सोनू सूद धीरे धीरे बलिष्ठ देह दिखाने के आयटम बनते जा रहे हैं । बोमन अपने लहजे से पारसी किरदार में जंचते हैं । विवान शाह साधारण हैं । हैप्पी न्यू इयर निश्चित ही आकर्षक भव्य और रंगीन है । फिल्म अपनी संरचना से बांधे रखती है । गीत संगीत प्रभावशाली नहीं है । फराह खान खुद कोरियोग्राफर रही हैं । फिर भी हैप्पी न्यू ईयर के डांस सीक्वेंस प्रभावित नहीं करते । दीपिका पादुकोण की नृत्य प्रतिभा की झलक भर मिल पाती है । फराह खान और शाह रुख खान की पिछली दोनों फिल्में मैं हूं ना और ओम शांति ओम से कमजोर फिल्म है हैप्पी न्यू ईयर । देश दुनिया के आर्थिक विकास के इस दौर में स्पष्ट दिखाई दे रहा है कि बहुराष्ट्रीय कंपनियां स्थानीय उद्यमियों के व्यापार को निगलने के साथ नष्ट कर रही हैं । इस व्यापक कथा की एक उपकथा सोनाली केबल में है । सोनाली का किरदार निभा रही रिया चक्रवर्ती मराठी युवती की भूमिका में मिसफिट लगती हैं । हालांकि भाषा और लहजे में मराठीपन लाने और डालने की कोशिश की गई है । स्मिता जयकर और स्वानंद किरकिरे ही अपने मराठी चरित्रों के साथ न्याय कर पाते हैं । अनुपम खेर के अभिनय का खास अंदाज यहां दोहराव पैदा करता है । उनका कैरेक्टर कैरीकेचर बन गया है । निर्देशक चारूदत्त आचार्य ने इंटरनेशनल मुद्दे को स्थानीय स्तर पर दिखाने की सराहनीय कोशिश की है । इस कोशिश में चरित्र और स्थितियों की वास्तविकता पर ध्यान देना जरूरी था । इसके अभाव में फिल्म प्रभावहीन हो जाती है । ऐसी फिल्मों में प्रेम कहानी डालने की अनिवार्यता नहीं रहनी चाहिए । इससे कथ्य और अभिव्यक्ति में व्यवधान आता है । फिल्म के कहानीकार राहिल काजी और निर्देशक रवींद्र गौतम भी अपने मकसद में सफल हुए हैं । फिल्म की यूएसपी उसका इमोशनल कार्ड है । वह कई मौकों पर दर्शकों के दिल को छूती है । वह साथ ही मुंबई शहर की जुझारू और लोगों की सहयोगी प्रवृत्ति भी दिखाती है । राहिल काजी ने दिलचस्प कथा रची है जो इशारों इशारों में नेताओं व मीडिया बिरादरी के स्याह पक्ष को पेश करती है । नेहा धूपिया संघर्षरत अभिनेत्री की भूमिका में हैं । उनका नाम जयप्रभा है । फिल्म के हर सीन एक दूसरे से जुड़े हुए हैं । वे तेज गति और रोचक तरीके से भ्रष्टाचार और ईमानदारी के अंतद्र्वंद्व को पेश करती है । अनुपम खेर ने जानदार परफॉर्मेंस दी है । पुरुषोत्तम जोशी के अवतार में बेबस मगर अपने सिद्धांतों पर अडिग रहने वाले शख्स की भूमिका को उन्होंने जीवंत बना दिया है । दिव्येंदु शर्मा का कॉमिक अवतार लोगों ने अब तक देखा है मगर यहां उनका विद्रोही रूप असर छोड़ता है । फिल्म की हीरोइन अदिति शर्मा भी अपने किरदार तान्या और राजेश शर्मा भ्रष्ट सीएम के रोल के संग न्याय करती हैं । फिल्म का संगीत भी निराश नहीं करता । में कश्मीर में आम्र्ड फोर्सेज स्पेशल पॉवर एक्ट के लागू होने के बाद सेना के दमन और नियंत्रण से वहां सामाजिक और राजनीतिक स्थिति बेकाबू हो गई थी । उसमें शामिल गजाला हैदर खुर्रम हिलाल और अर्शिया की जिंदगी लहुलूहान हो रही थी और सफेद बर्फ पर बिखरे लाल छीटों की चीख गूंज रही थी । विशाल भारद्वाज निस्संदेह अपनी पीढ़ी के समर्थ और संवेदनशील फिल्मकार हैं । बाजार और फैशन के दवाब से परे जाकर वे क्रिएटिव कट्टरता के साथ फिल्में बनाते हैं । उनकी फिल्मों में भावना और संवेदना का घनत्व ज्यादा रहता है । अच्छी बात है कि उनकी फिल्मों की अनेक व्याख्याएं हो सकती हैं । विशाल भारद्वाज हैदर में भी सरल नहीं हैं । उन्होंने शेक्सपियर के हैमलेट से प्रेरित हैदर को और परतदार एवं जटिल बना दिया है । हैदर में सभी कलाकार अपने किरदारों को प्रभावशाली तरीके से जीने की मेहनत करते हैं । इनमें गजाला बनी तब्बू और खुर्रम बने केके मेनन अपने प्रयासों में सफल रहते हैं । हालांकि दोनों अपनी मुग्धकारी प्रतिभाएं अनेक फिल्मों में साबित कर चुके हैं लेकिन इस फिल्म में विशाल के निर्देशन में उन्हें फिर से निखरते देखना अच्छा लगता है । शाहिद कपूर ने हैदर के बाहरी रूप को अच्छी तरह अंगीकार किया है । वे किरदार के आंतरिक द्वेष और प्रतिशोध को सही अनुपात में आत्मसात नहीं कर सके हैं । श्रद्धा कपूर अदायगी और संवाद अदायगी दोनों में विफल रही हैं । उनका खूबसूरत चेहरा भावों के अनुरूप नहीं बदलता । ललित परिमू आशीष विद्यार्थी जैसे सहयोगी किरदारों की वेशभूषा पर ध्यान नहीं दिया गया है । इरफान सिद्धहस्त अभिनेता हैं । उनकी मौजूदगी ही काफी लगती है । यहां वे रूहदार को तरजीह देते नहीं दिखाई पड़ते । हैदर की खोज है नरेंद्र झा । हैदर के पिता के रूप में उन्होंने शानदार परफारमेंस दी है । हैदर है तो के कश्मीर की पृष्ठभूमि पर लेकिन फिल्म में उस साल की राजनीतिक घटनाओं का कोई रेफरेंस नहीं है । विशाल भारद्वाज की फिल्मों में लतीफे और मजाकिया किरदार भी रहते हैं । इस फिल्म में अभिनेता सलमान खान के प्रतिरूप बने दोनों सलमान और लतीफों पर हंसी तो आती है मगर यह हंसी फिल्म के अभिप्राय को कमजोर करती है । आनंद कुमार की फिल्म देसी कट्टे में अनेक विषयों को एक ही कहानी में पिरोने की असफल कोशिश की गई है । यह फिल्म दो दोस्तों की कहानी है जो एक साथ गैंगवॉर अपराध राजनीति का दुष्चक्र खेल के प्रति जागरूकता समाज में बढ़ रहे अपराधीकरण आदि विषयों को टटोलने का प्रयास करती है । नतीजतन यह फिल्म किसी भी विषय को ढंग से पेश नहीं कर पाती । इसमें कलाकारों की भीड़ है । भीड़ इसलिए कि उन किरदारों को लेखक ने ठोस और निजी पहचान नहीं दी है । यही कारण है कि आशुतोष राणा अखिलेंद्र मिश्रा सुनील शेट्टी आदि के होने के बावजूद फिल्म बांध नहीं पाती । देसी कट्टे निहायत कमजोर फिल्म है । अफसोस की बात है कि मिले अवसर का सही उपयोग न होने पर भविष्य की अनेक संभावनाओं का दम घुट जाता है । नई कोशिशों पर रोक लग जाती है । यह फिल्म मनोरंजन थोड़ा कम करती है अगर हबीब फैजल की दावत एइश्क में कुछ व्यंजनों का जिक्र भी करते तो फिल्म और जायकेदार हो जाती । हिंदी में बनी यह पहली ऐसी फिल्म है जिसमें नॉनवेज व्यंजनों का खुलेआम उल्लेख होता है । इस लिहाज से यह फूड फिल्म कही जा सकती है । मनोरंजन की इस दावत में इश्क का तडक़ा लगाया गया है । हैदराबाद और लखनऊ की भाषा और परिवेश पर मेहनत की गई है । हैदराबादी लहजे पर ज् मेहनत की गई है । लखनवी अंदाज पर अधिक तवज् नहीं है । फिल्म का शीर्षक थीम के मुताबिक जायकेदार नहीं है । दावत एइश्क को गाने में लाने के लिए कौसर मुनीर को भी मेहनत करनी पड़ी है । फिल्म के गीत कथ्य के साथ संगति नहीं बिठा पाते । कौसर मुनीर गीतों में अर्थ लाने के लिए सहजता और स्वाभाविकता खो देती हैं । होली गीत में कैसे हैदराबाद की गुलरेज अचानक लखनवी लब्जों का इस्तेमाल करने लगती है । तार्र्किकता तो गीतों की तरह अनेक दृश्यों में भी नहीं है । यह फिल्म स्पष्ट शब्दों में दहेज का सवाल उठाती है और धारा का उल्लेख करती है । इसके लिए हबीब फैजल अवश्य धन्यवाद के पात्र हैं । शशांक घोष की खूबसूरत की तुलना अगर हृषिकेष मुखर्जी की खूबसूरत से करने के इरादे से सोनम कपूर की यह फिल्म देखेंगे तो निराशा और असंतुष्टि होगी । यह फिल्म पुरानी फिल्म के मूल तत्व को लेकर नए सिरे से कथा रचती है । एक अनुशासित और कठोर माहौल के परिवार में चुलबुली लड़की आती है और वह अपने उन्मुक्त नैसर्गिक गुणों से व्यवस्था बदल देती है । निर्देशक शशांक घोष और उनके लेखक ने मूल फिल्म के समकक्ष पहुंचने की भूल नहीं की है । उन्होंने नए परिवेश में नए किरदारों को रखा है । खूबसूरत सामंती व्यवहार और आधुनिक सोच समझ के द्वंद्व को रोचक तरीके से पर्दे पर ले आती है । मिली चक्रवर्ती की उन्मुक्तता को पर्दे पर जीवंत करने में सोनम कपूर की स्वाभाविकता दिखती है । ऐसा लगता है कि उन्हें खास मेहनत नहीं करनी पड़ी हैं जबकि मिली के मिजाज को अंत तक निभा ले जाने में श्रम लगा होगा । सोनम कपूर ने मिली के स्वभाव को अपने हाव भाव और अभिनय से रोचक बना दिया है । रानी साहिबा की भूमिका में रत्ना पाठक शाह की पकड़ और अकड़ किरदार के अनुकूल है । विक्रम सिंह राठौड़ की भूमिका में पाकिस्तानी अभिनेता फवाद खान अपनी प्रतिभा से मुग्ध करते हैं । न्होंने अभिनय में संयम और शिष्टता का परिचय दिया है । राजा साहब की भूमिका में अमीर राजा हुसैन जंचे हैं । रामसेवक के छोटे किरदार में अशोक बांठिया भी नोटिस होते हैं । हां फिल्म में हिंदी शब्दों के प्रति बरती गई लापरवाही अखरती है । सूर्यगढ़ को सूर्यगड़ और संभलगढ़ को समभलगढ़ लिखना और दिसंबर को डिसेंबर बोलना सही नहीं लगता । यह हिंदी की मौलिक फिल्म नहीं है । होमी अदजानिया निर्देशित फाइंडिंग फैनी मूल रूप से इंग्लिश फिल्म है । हालांकि यह हॉलीवुड की इंग्लिश फिल्म से अलग है क्योंकि इसमें गोवा है । भाषा और मुहावरों का वहां सटीक उपयोग हुआ है । हिंदी में डब करने में मजा खो गया है और प्रभाव भी । कई दृश्यों में तो होंठ कुछ और ढंग से हिल रहे हैं और सुनाई कुछ और पड़ रहा है । यह एक साथ इंग्लिश और हिंदी में बनी फिल्म नहीं है । इन दिनों हॉलीवुड की फिल्में भी डब होकर हिंदी में रिलीज होती हैं लेकिन उनमें होंठ और शब्दों को मिलाने की कोशिश रहती है । फाइंडिंग फैनी में लापरवाही झलकती है । होमी अदजानिया ने गोवा के पृष्ठभूमि के इन किरदारों की निजी विसंगति में हास्य पैदा किया है । होमी इन किरदारों के माहौल और मूड को अच्छी तरह से चित्रित करते हैं । उन्हें उम्दा कलाकारों से भरपूर सहयोग मिला है । पंकज कपूर और नसीरुद्दीन शाह ने वैसे इस से बेहतर परफारमेंस से हमें चकित किया है । डिंपल भी अपनी छोटी भूमिकाओं में प्रभावित करती रही हैं । फाइंडिंग फैनी वास्तव में दीपिका पादुकोण और अर्जुन कपूर के लिए उल्लेखनीय हैं । दोनों ने मिले मौके के हिसाब से मेहनत की और अपनी अदाकारी से संतुष्ट किया है । हिंदी फिल्मों के आम दर्शक फाइंडिंग फैनी का अपेक्षित आनंद नहीं उठा सकेंगे । फिल्म की भावभूमि उनके लिए नई और अपरिचित है । हालांकि डिजाइन के लिहाज से यह यूजर्स को काफी अट्रैक्टिव करेगी । पहली नजर में तो यह एक आम वॉच ही लगेगी लेकिन इंटरनल सिस् इसको आम से खास बना देगा । एलजी में

ओवरऑल देखें तो कम दाम में यह बेहतरीन डिवाइस है लेकिन मार्केट में आई अन् घड़ियों को देखते हुए इसे कड़ा कंप् मिल सकता है । हमने ट्रू ब्ल्यू वॉयस की ओर से पहले पेश किए गए ब्ल्यूटूथ किट्स को भी परखा है और हम कीमत के हिसाब से उसकी क्षमता के प्रभावित हुए थे । हमने यहां टीबीवी का रिव्यू किया है जिसका डिजाइन किसी लॉकेट की तरह है । यह ऐसा ब्ल्यूटूथ डिवाइस है जिसे जैक वाले किसी भी हेडसेट से जोड़ा जा सकता है । कीमत को लेकर सचेत रहने वाले खरीदारों को ध्यान में रखते हुए इस डिवाइस को बनाया गया है लेकिन इसके बावजूद यह अच्छी साउंड क्वालिटी देने वाला प्रतीत होता है । हेडसेट बहुत ही सरल जैक वाला ओपन ड्राइवर की तरह का ईयरफोन है । यह यूनिट देखने में अच्छा लगता है और इसे अच्छी गुणवत्ता वाले प्लास्टिक से बनाया गया है । इसका सामने वाला हिस्सा सफेद और पीछे वाला हिस्सा भूरा ग्रे है । डिवाइस हल्का है लेकिन किसी कारणवश टीबीवी ने इसका निश्चत वजन नहीं बताया है । इसका यूजर इंटरफेस काफी सरल है । इस किट के साथ दिए गए हेडसेट की गुणवत्ता अच्छी है और वॉल्यूम फुल करने के बावजूद इसमें कोई कमी नहीं आती है । हालांकि साउंड क्वालिटी बाजार में मौजूद विकल्पों में सर्वश्रेष्ठ नहीं है लेकिन निश्चित तौर पर इसे खराब नहीं कहा जा सकता है । हर रेंज कम मध्यम और ऊंचा में प्ले करता है और आवाज भी स्पष्ट है । जहां तक कॉल क्वालिटी का सवाल है तो क्लेरिटी फोन के डाइरेक्ट ईयरपीस की तरह अच्छी है । हालांकि माइक रिसेप्शन खासकर उस स्थित में जब आप डिवाइस को अपने शर्ट पर लगाते हैं बहुत अच्छा नहीं है । जब आप इसे अपनी गर्दन के करीब रखते हैं अगर आप टी शर्ट पहने हुए हों रिसेप्शन काफी अच्छा हो जाता है । इसलिए निचोड़ यह है कि आगर आपको आरामदायक बातचीत का आनंद उठाना है तो माइक को सही जगह पर लगाना होगा । न्वाइस कैंसिलेशन के लिए कोई अलग माइक नहीं है यद्यपि यह इसके लिए सॉफ्टवेयर और न्वाइस रिडक्शन टेकनोलॉजी का इस्तेमाल करता है । यह सिस्टम आस पास के शोर को कम करने के लिए बहुत हद तक अच्छा काम करता है लेकिन यह पूरी तरह से शोर को समाप्त नहीं करता है । डिवाइस की कीमत को देखते हुए यह एक खास फीचर है । इस घड़ी के बारे में सबसे बड़ी और खास बात यह है कि ये सिर्फ आपको समय ही नहीं बताएगी न ही तो आपके लिए सिर्फ संचार का माध् होगी बल्कि ये आपके स् और फ में भी आपकी साथी होगी । पहली है $ लगभग रुपये और $ लगभग रुपये में । दूसरी है $ रुपये और $ रुपये के बीच में । वहीं तीसरी है कैरेट गोल् में उपलब् । इसकी कीमत की बात करें तो इसकी शुरुआत

कर्व ग् वाले जेनवॉच में आपको इंच का डिस् मिलेगा । सैमसंग की इस स् का सबसे खास फीचर इसकी कनेक्टिविटी है । कंपनी ने इस स् में यूजर्स के लिये कनेक्टिविटी की सुविधा दी है । इसके अलावा इस स् में इंच की कर्व् डिस् लगी हुई है । इसके साथ ही इसमें आपको मैसेज कनवर्जेशन की भी सुविधा मिलेगी । सैमसंग ने अपनी इस डिवाइस का डिजाइन बहुत ही सुविधाजनक तरीके से तैयार किया है । इस स् में आप कनेक्टिविटी के जरिये अपने स् से भी जुड़े रहेंगे । जब भी आप अपने फोन से दूर होंगे तो आपके फोन में आने वाले मैसेज और नोटिफिकेशन को यह स् डिटेक् कर लेगी और आपको इन मैसेजेस की इंफार्मेशन दे देगी । इसके अलावा सैमसंग ने अपनी इस स् में ऑन स् की बोर्ड की भी फैसेलिटी दी है । इसके जरिये आप इन मैसेज का रिप् भी कर सकते हैं । स् सिस् के फीचर्स से लेस है । भारतीय बाजार में इसकी रुपये रखी गई है । अगर स् टेक और यूज़ेबिलिटी की बात करें तो को अन् स् के बीच राजा घोषित करने के लिए काफी विवादास्पद श्रेणी में रखा गया है । ऐसा इसलिए भी है क् इस घड़ी का बॉडी शेप देखने में काफी मर्दाना सा है । घड़ी पर स् दी गई है । इस घड़ी को पानी से बचाने की बिल् भी जरूरत नहीं है । घड़ी को पावर देने के लिए इसपर की बैट्री दी गई है । यह बैट्री आपकी घड़ी को दो दिन तक बेहतरीन तौर पर चलाएगी । वहीं इसकी प्रतिस् घड़ पर गौर करें तो वो सिर्फ एक दिन का बैट्री बैकअप देती हैं । घड़ी क् क् स् प्रोसेसर पर रन करती है । इसमें की इंटरनल स् दी गई है । कनेक्टिविटी के लिए वाई फाई ब् और की सुविधा दी गई है । एपल स्मार्टवॉच में बहुत सी खूबियां है । यह आपके आइफोन से

एपल की यह स्मार्टवॉच बहुत एलिगेंट और डिलाइटफुल है । एपल वॉच का खुद सेट होने के लिए इंतजार करें । एपल वॉच में स्टेन्लेस स्टील फीनिश और फ्लुओरोएलास्टोमर बैंड है । म्युजिक के साथ फिटनेस फीचर और कॉल करने

देखें । इसके इनबॉक्स में जाकर मैसेज और मेल चेक कर सकते हैं । कॉन्टेक्ट लिस्ट में अपने सभी कॉन्टेक्ट्स को रख सकते हैं । पासबुक फीचर भी उपलब्ध है । एपल वॉच का वर्ल्ड क्लॉक फीचर पूरे विश्व का समय दिखाता है आप अपने देश या जिस किसी भी देश के समय के विषय में जानकारी चाहते है यह देता है । एप लोडिंग में लगने वाला समय इस स्मार्टवॉच का एक दोष है । एक्टिविटी मूव और एक्सर्साइज फीचर के साथ आप अपने पूरी दिनचर्या को देख सकते हैं कि आप कितना चलें बैठे और आपका फिटनेस वर्कआउट कैसा रहा । एपल के तीन रिंग मूव एक्सरसाइज और स्टैंड फिटनेस डाटा के लिए अप्रोच करते हैं । एपल वॉच का कैमरा कमाल का है । इसमें वॉच में फोटो गैलरी एप भी उपलब्ध है । एपल वॉच की घंटे की बैटरी लाइफ आपका पूरा दिन साथ देती है । अन्य एंड्रायड वेयर डिवाइसेज के मुकाबले यह बहुत छोटी है । इसमें वॉच में हार्ट रेट सेंसर है । कुलमिलाकर कहा जा सकता है कि एपल वॉच को इस्तेमाल करने में खुशी होती है । एपल वॉच स्पोर्ट की कीमत हजार रुपये से शुरू हो रही है जबकि दूसरे वैरिएंट की कीमत हजार रुपये और तीसरे वैरिएंट की कीमत लाख हजार रुपये है । लुक बढिया है । बैटरी लाइफ बहुत बढिया है । परफॉर्मेंस में समरूपता नहीं कभी अच्छा कभी बुरा परफॉर्मेंस नोटिफिकेशन का मिस हो जाना । बहुत कम कार्यक्षमता है । इसमें कई स्मार्ट फंक्शन की कमी है और कई बार सही नोटिफिकेशंस भी नहीं दे पाता । हमने अभी मोटोरोला की समीक्षा की थी जो वास्तव में आज के बाजार में सबसे अच्छा स्मार्टवॉच नजर आता है । हालांकि यह दूसरा डिवाइस मोटो के लुक से खुद को बेहतर साबित कर सकता है लेकिन इसके साथ ही एक तथ्य यह भी है कि सिर्फ लुक के लिए घड़ी नहीं पहनी जाती । मार्टिन नोटिफायर का लुक बहुत हद तक केसियो के जी शॉक वॉच से मिलता जुलता है । इससे इतना तो तय है कि यह दिखने में बहुत आकर्षक है । इसके दाईं ओर यूएसबी चार्जिंग पोर्ट के साथ एक बटन और बाईं ओर दो बटन हैं । घड़ी में विशेष यूएसबी केबल लगे हैं जो इसे चार्ज करने के लिए दिए गए हैं । डायल पर ओएलईडी स्क्रीन के साथ यह साधारण कलाई घड़ी की तरह ही दिखती है । स्क्रीन पतला और आकार में छोटा जो नोटिफिकेशन देखेने आदि के काम आता है । नीचे की तरफ बाईं ओर दिया बटन मेन्यू पर जाने और सबसे ऊपर दिया गया बाईं ओर का बटन उसमें से अपनी पसंद और जरूरत का ऑप्शन सेलेक्ट करने के काम आता है । कुल मिलाकर मार्टिन नोटिफायार क्लासिक परंपरागत घड़ियों की तरह ही दिखता है जो वास्तव लुक के लिए बहुत अच्छा है । बाजार में अभी उपलब्ध सभी स्मार्टवॉच में जाहिर तौर पर यह सबसे अच्छा दिखने वाला स्मार्टवॉच है । बात जब फीचर की आती है तो लुक की सारी अच्छाइयां कहीं छुप गई लगती हैं । परंपरागत घडियों की तरह दिखना नोटिफायर की खूबी है लेकिन इसके अलावा और कुछ खास इसमें नजर नहीं आता । ओएलईडी स्क्रीन ऐसे भी बेहद छोटा है जबकि इसे यहां नोटिफिकेशन देखने के लिए बनाया गया है जिसमें कॉल रिसीव कराने के अलावा किसी भी नोटिफिकेशन का आअप जवाब नहीं दे सकते । इसके लिए अपने स्मार्टफोन पर आपको मार्टिन नोटिफायर एप डाउनलोड कर उसे अपने फोन से सिंक करना होता है । वॉच कैमरा शटर बटन की तरह भी काम कर सकता है । हालांकि मार्टिन नोटिफायर में वास्तविक स्मार्टवॉच कहलाने वाले पर्याप्त फीचर्स नहीं हैं कई बार इसके वर्तमान फीचर्स में भी कुछ गड़बड़ियां आती हैं । उदाहरण के लिए हमारे रेगुलर प्रयोग में इसने एक बार हमें जीमेल और ट्विटर का नोटिफिकेशन नहीं दिया जबकि ये एप इसमें पहले ही सेलेक्टेड थे । यहां तक कि कई बार फोन पर आया टेक्स्ट मैसेज भी यह नहीं दिखाता । इसके अलावे इसमें आने वाले नोटिफिकेशंस को आप केवल देख सकते हैं उसका जवाब नहीं दे सकते । यह भी इसके फंक्शन की एक बड़ी कमी है । इतना ही नहीं नोटिफिकेशन पूरी स्क्रीन पर घूमता है और अगर आप सेकंड के विंडो में नोटिफिकेशन मिस कर देते हैं तो इसे देखने के लिए आपको अपने फोन को देखना पड़ेगा । मोटो की तुलन में यह इसका दूसरा मजबूत पार्ट है । मात्र एक चार्ज में मार्टिन नोटिफायर दिन चला हालांकि यह बहुत अधिक आश्चर्यचकित करने वाला नहीं है क्योंकि इसमें बहुत सी स्मार्ट एक्टिविटीज हैं ही नहीं । एप का बैटरी इंडिकेटर बहुत सही जानकारी नहीं देता । एक बार बैटरी का इंडिकेटर दो दिनों तक चल सकने वाला बैटरी बता रहा था और अचानक यह बताने लगा । एक अच्छी चीज यह है कि इसमें दो बैटरी दिए गए हैं । एक बटन सेल इसके परंपरागत वॉच फंक्शन के लिए है जबकि दूसरा लाइ पो बैटरी स्मार्ट फंक्शन से जुड़ा है । मार्टिन नोटिफायर को एक अच्छा दिखने वाला डिवाइस माना जा सकता है लेकिन स्मार्टवॉच के रूप में इसकी कीमत को साबित करने में यह असफल है । बाजार में यह रु की कीमत में उपभोक्ताओं के लिए उपलब्ध है लेकिन इसकी तुलना में इसमें स्मार्ट फंक्शन कहीं नजर नहीं आते । इसलिए हमारी राय में अगर आपको सिर्फ एक वॉच चाहिए जिसमें कुछ स्मार्ट फीचर हों तो भी आपको अच्छा लगेगा तो यह वॉच खरीद सकते हैं लेकिन अगर आपको वास्तव में एक स्मार्टवॉच चाहिए तो यह डील आपके लिए सही साबित नहीं होगी । हालांकि बाजार में उपलब्ध कोई भी स्मार्टवॉच बहुत अच्छा नहीं कहा जा सकता लेकिन मार्टिन नोटिफायर उन सबमें भी बहुत निचले पायदान पर रहते हुए प्रभावशाली स्मार्टवॉच पेश करने की एक और असफल कोशिश ही कही जाएगी । बेहतरीन रूप से डिज़ाइन किया हुआ है । इतना आरामदायक कि पूरा दिन पहना जा सके । वायरलेस चार्जिंग है । ख़राब बैटरी लाइफ है । सीमित कार्यक्षमता है । महंगी कीमत है । अब तक की पहने जा सकने वाले सभी डिवाइस में मोटो की सबसे प्रशंसनीय है । मोटोरोला ने न केवल इसे खूबसूरती से डिज़ाइन किया है बल्कि इसे तैयार करने में अद्भुत प्रयास का परिचय भी दिया है । एक उम्दा प्रोडक्ट होने के बावजूद इसमें कुछ ऐसी खामियां है जो निराशाजनक है । घड़ी महंगी तो है ही साथ ही साथ बैटरी लाइफ भी काफी ख़राब है । इसके फीचर्स और प्रोडक्टिविटी भी कमतर एहसास देते है । मोटो स्मार्टवॉच दिखने में तो काफी कूल है ही साथ ही साथ अपने गोल आकार के डायल डिज़ाइन के साथ यह गूगल के लेटेस्ट एंड्रॉयड प्लेटफार्म पर कंज्यूमर्स को सबसे ज्यादा आकर्षित कर रहा है । यह देखने में एक वर्ग / आयताकार डायल की तुलना में अधिक आकर्षक लगता है । डायल हालांकि काफी मोटी है और बड़ी लगती है लेकिन यह कलाई पर अच्छी तरह फिट बैठती है । मुख्य डायल स्टेनलेस स्टील का बना हुआ है और इंच राउंड टचस्क्रीन डिस्प्ले को स्क्रैच प्रूफ गोरिल्ला गिलास से कवर किया गया है । डिस्प्ले की क्वालिटी उच्च स्तर की है पर अगर हम पिक्सल डेंसिटी पीपीआई की बात करें तो वो बहुत अच्छा नहीं है । डिस्प्ले भी बहुत कम पर इन सबके बावजूद यह डिवाइस परफेक्ट लगता है । मोटो साधारण घड़ियों की तरह ही दिखता है । आप लंबे समय तक इसे पहन सकते हैं । सर्टिफाइड होने के कारण यह धूल और पानी से भी पूरी तरह सुरक्षित है । आप टेक्स्ट मैसेज को क्विक रिप्लाई भी दे सकते हैं । वास्तव में वॉच बेहद रेस्पॉंसिव है और हमेशा सही रिजल्ट्स देती है । कुछ बहुत छोटी कमियां भी हैं लेकिन इन्हें अनदेखा किया जा सकता है । की बजाय एमएएच बैटरी मालूम पड़ती है जिसकी एमएएच की रेंज मोटोरोला ने ही कंफर्म की है । चार्ज के बाद हमने इसे पूरा दिन चलाया । दिनों के यूज में हमें पता चला कि यह रेगुलर यूज में लगभग घंटे ही मात्र चल पाता है । यह ब्राइटनेस मोड आदि को ऑफ करने के बाद था । एक दिन से ज्यादा यह नहीं चल सकता और अपने स्मार्तफोन के साथ आपको इसे भी हर दिन चार्ज करना पड़ेगा । मोटोरोला डिवाइस अपने आप में बेस्ट कहा जा सकता है क्योंकि इसका लुक बेहद आकर्षक है । पर्फॉर्मेंस वास्तव में स्मूथ है और डिजाइन बेहद अलग है जो आपको हाथ पर पहनते हुए बहुत कूल लगता है । पर जब बात रेकमेंडेशन की आती है तो हम इसे खरीदने के सलाह नहीं देंगे । अभी इसमें फीचर्स बहुत कम हैं और सुधारों की आवश्यकता ज्यादा है । पर अभी के लिए मोटो के लिए खर्च करना कहीं से समझदारी का सौदा नहीं लगता । जहां का प्राइस है $ जो सैमसंग गैलेक्सी गियर से पर्सेंट कम है और कई एंड्रोइड फोन्स के साथ काम करती है वहीं दूसरी तरफ सैमसंग गैलेक्सी का प्राइस है $ और वो सिर्फ सैमसंग के कुछ ही महंगे फोन्स के साथ ही कम्पैटिबल है । पर मेसेजेस और नोटिफिकेशंस ऐसे कीजिए मैनेज आपकी वॉच पर क्या आए और क्या ना आए ये कंट्रोल करने के लिए फोन पर स्मार्ट कनेक्ट एप डाउनलोड करना होगा । इस एप से यूजर नोटिफिकेशंस या मेसेजेस कोमैनेज कर सकते हैं । सैमसंग की यह नई घड़ी गियर वाच के वर्जन के साथ भारतीय बाजार में आई है जिसकी कीमत कंपनी ने रुपये रखी है । अपने पिछले मॉडल गियर के मुकाबले में गियर भी काफी हद तक उसी लुक में आई है । गियर स्पो में इंच का सुपर एमोलेड डिस्प्ले लगा है जो आपको उम्दा रंग व आउटडोर विजिबिलिटी देने में सक्षम साबित होगा । मेटालिक बॉडी से बनी यह घड़ी आपको एक टिकाऊ सुविधा देने का वादा करती है । गियर स्पो को चार्ज करने के लिए कंपनी ने एक माइक्रो यूएसबी डॉक दिया है जो इस घड़ी के हिसाब से आसानी से फिट हो जाता है । लेकिन विशेषज्ञों की मानें तो इस डिवाइस को बहुत ही ध्यान से रखने की जरूरत है । इस डिवाइस की मेटालिक बॉडी उसे बाकी डिवाइस से उत्तम बनाती है । इसके साथ ही कंपनी ने इसे धूल व पानी रहित बनाया है । एक स्मार्टफोन की तुलना में सैमसंग ने गियर स्पो में कई सारी विशेषताएं डाली हैं जैसे कि इस डिवाइस पर आप व्हाट्स एप एसएमएस ट्विटर फेसबुक व अन्य चीजें इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं । इसके साथ ही डिवाइस के मेगापिक्सल कैमरे की मदद से तस्वीरें भी ले सकते हैं । यह आधुनिक घड़ी हार्ट सेंसर की मदद से आपके दिल के स्वास्थ्य का भी पता लगाती है । सैमसंग की यह घड़ी कंपनी के सभी गैलेक्सी डिवाइस से लेकर गैलेक्सी ग्रैंड पर भी ब्लूटूथ से जोड़ने पर आसानी से काम करेगी । यह डिवाइस ब्लूटूथ द्वारा स्मार्टफोन्स से कनेक्ट की जा सकती है यह एंड्रायड और आइफोन दोनों स्मार्टफोन के साथ कम्पेटिबल है । यूफिट बैंड यूफिट एप के साथ आता है और एकसाथ मिलकर यूजर्स को स्टेप ट्रेकिंग स्लिप ट्रेकिंग डिस्टेंस वॉक और कैलोरी बर्न जैसे फीचर्स देते हैं । एप यूजर्स को अपने डेटाबेस के साथ कितनी कैलोरीज वह प्रयुक्त कर चुके हैं ट्रैक करने देता है जिनमें भारतीय स्नैक्स और डिशेज भी शामिल है । स्मार्टफोन बैंड में एक डिस्प्ले फीचर है जो यूजर्स को इनकमिंग कॉल्स और मेसेज के बारे में बताने के अलावा समय दिखाता है । यह डिवाइस फिटनेस फोकस करती है और यूजर के सोने के पैटर्न को भी ट्रैक करेगी । इसे पानी व डस्ट के लिए भी रेटिंग दिया गया है । आसुस के इस स्मार्टवॉच की बॉडी स्टेनलेस स्टील की बनी है । इसमें हर्ट रेट मॉनिटर भी लगा है । आसुस ने एक एप और वेब इंटरफेस भी बनाया है । इसके उपयोग से यूजर वॉच से एप में डाटा सिंक कर सकते हें । इस इंटरफेस को आसुस हाइविवो और आसुस हेल्थ केयर भी कहा गया है । यह स्मार्टवॉच अपने एंड्रायड आधारित ओएस पर चलेगी । मगर क् माउंटेन अलटीमेट वन वॉचबैंड ने आईपॉड नैनो के लिए एक खास तरह की कवरिंग का निमार्ण किया है । जो आईपॉड को नमी और पानी से दूर रखेगी । बैंड का बनाने में सिलिकॉन का प्रयोग किया

घड़ी समझने की भूल मत करिएगा क् यह देखने में केवल घड़ी की तरह लगती है मगर आईवॉच किसी स् से कम नहीं । मशहूर डिजाइन एंटोनियो ने आईवाच की नई डिजाइन तैयार की है जिसके अनुसार नई आईवॉच में जीबी मैमोरी के साथ वाईफाई ब् और फ्रंट कैमरे की सुविधा भी दी गई होगी । फ्रंट कैमरे की मदद से यूजर वीडियो कालिंग की सुविधा का लाभ उठा सकेगा । इसके अलावा एप् आईवॉच की स् में मौसम समय के अलावा कैलेंडर जैसी सूचनाएं यूजर कभी भी देख सकता है । आईवॉच की मदद से मेल एसएमएस भी भेजे जा सकते हैं । एक तरह से यह साधारण फोन से बेहतर काम करेगी । बहुत अधिक फीचर्स नहीं हैं । सभी फीचर्स को ध्यान में रखते हुए को एक प्रभावोत्पादक उत्पाद माना जा सकता है । फीचर्स की तुलना में रु. की कम कीमत भी आकर्षित करती है । अगर के साथ कहीं कोई नकारात्मक बात आती है तो केवल इसके फीचर्स के साथ । डेजीचेन जैसे कुछ अन्य फीचर्स से जोड़कर इसे और भी बेहतर बनाया जा सकता था । कुछ समय तक लॉगिटेक अपने अल्टिमेट ईयर्स यूई ब्रांडेड ब्लूटूथ स्पीकर्स को भारतीय बाजार बेचने की कोशिश में था । इस एक प्रकार की कोशिश से हटते हुए अब यह अपने स्पीकर्स में विविधता लाता प्रतीत हो रहा है । इसकी इस कोशिश में यूई के बजाय ब्रांडेड लॉगिटेक को दी जा रही प्राथमिकता साफ दिखाई देती है । यह छोटा स्पीकर जो चेन वाली जेब घड़ी की तरह दिखती है वास्तव में वैसा ही स्पीकर है । हालांकि स्पीकर के पास यूई का ब्रांड नेम नहीं है पर इसका चमकरहित मैटेरियल चमकीला रंग बड़े आकार के मोटे बटंस बहुत हद तक यूई के डिजाइन से मिलते या इससे प्रेरित लगते हैं । यूई के उत्पादों में दिखने वाली ये सभी खूबियां स्पीकर्स में भी हैं । यह पांच रंगों में बिक्री के लिए उपलब्ध है । चमकीले नारंगी में रंगा जंगला और नीले रंग की बॉडी वास्तव में एक भड़कीला मेल है लेकिन आश्चर्यजनक रूप से रंगों का यह मेल यहां बेहद आकर्षक लग रहा है । इसकी बनावट भी काफी मजबूत है । हालांकि हमने इसे गिराकर नहीं देखा लेकिन इसे देखकर लगता है कि दो तीन बार गिरने के बाद भी डिवाइस को नुकसान नहीं होगा । कार्यक्षमता के आधार पर देखें तो इस कीमत में बाजार में उपलब्ध इसी प्रकार के अन्य उत्पादों की तुलना में यह कहीं बेहतर है । इसकी एक बड़ी खूबी इसकी तेज आवाज भी है । तेज आवाज में भी इसकी आवाज फटती नहीं या उसमें किसी प्रकार की कोई बाधा नहीं आती और आवाज स्पष्ट सुनाई देती है । इसकी माइक्रोफोन की गुणवत्ता भी अच्छी है । स्पीकर को कांफ्रेस कॉल डिवाइस के रूप में उपयोग किया जा सकता है । पांच घंटे तक बैटरी चलने का इसका दावा भी बहुत हद तक सही लगता है । कुल मिलाकर स्पीकर लुभावना है खासकर इसकी कीमत बेहद आकर्षक है । डिज़ाइन काफी ट्रेडिशनल है । इसमें ग्लास फ्रंट प्लेट स्टेनलेस स्टील नॉब्स और क्लासिक ब्लू लाइट वाला वीयू मीटर दिया है । यह बेहद खूबसूरत और हाईटेक है । इसमें बेहतरीन क्वालिटी स्पीकर लगे हैं । दो इन वूफर भी हैं । वॉट के एम्प्लिफायर से जबरदस्त म्यूजिक सुन सकते हैं । इसका साइज़ ज्यादा बड़ा नहीं है लेकिन वजन काफी ज्यादा है । इन स्पीकर का मॉडल है जो स्पीकर के साथ मोबाइल स्टैंड का भी काम करते हैं । इन स्पीकर की कीमत रुपए है । इस डिवाइस पर कंपनी महीने की वारंटी के दे रही है । इसमें ब्लैक और व्हाइट कलर के कॉम्बिनेशन में आ रहे हैं । लैपकेयर स्मार्टफोन कम्प्यूटर टैबलेट लैपटॉप की एक्सेसरीज बनाने वाली भारत की लीडिंग ब्रांड है । इन स्पीकर का डिजाइन और ऑडियो क्वालिटी शानदार है । सबसे अच्छी बात इन स्पीकर का साइज है जिसे लेकर आसानी से ट्रेवल किया जा सकता है । इन स्पीकर को खूबसूरत डिजाइन के साथ बैटरी दी गई है । जो घंटे का ऑडियो बैकअप देती है । इन स्पीकर्स में ब्लूटूथ और नियर फील्ड कम्युनिकेशन की कनेक्टिविटी दी गई है । इस

क्योंकि ये बजट में हैं । इसे यूजर्स आसानी से अपने स्मार्टफोन टैबलेट लैपटॉप से कनेक्ट करके म्यूजिक का मजा ले सकते हैं । टैबलेट में सिंगल कोर प्रोसेसर बीते जामने की बात लगता है लेकिन दिलचस्प बात है कि एचसीएल जैसी दिग्गज कम्पनी ने ऐसे समय में सिंग कोर प्रोसेसर आधारित टैब्लेट बाज़ार में उतारा है जब कि डयूअल और क्वाड कोर प्रोसेसर वाले टैबलेट की भरमार है । गौरतलब है कि प्रोसेसर की क्षमता जितनी ज्यादा होगी उतने ज्यादा प्रभावी ढंग से आपका टैबलेट काम करेगा सिंगल कोर में सबसे कम क्षमता होती है जबकि डयूअल कोर में उसे ज्यादा क्षमता होती है और क्वाड कोर इन दोनों से ज्यादा क्षमता वाला प्रोसेसर है । सात इंच की स्क्रीन वाले इस टैबलेट की लुक औसत से बेहतर है । इसमें एमपी का कैमरा है जो बहुत ज्यादा शानदार तस्वीर नहीं खींच सकता है । टैब्लेट में मिनी एचडीएमआई पोर्ट मिनी यूएसबी पीसी इंटरफेस और माक्रोफोन के लिए एक ओपनिंग भी है । स्क्रीन का रिज़ोल्यूशन गुणा है जो काफी अच्छा है । फोन में माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड के अलावा दो सिम कार्ड भी डाले जा सकते हैं । इस टैबलेट की एक खासियत यह है कि इसमें कालिंग की सुविधा है । फोन में एआरएम कार्टेक्स प्रोसेसर है जिसका क्षमता एक गीगाहर्टज है इसमें पावरवीआरएसजीएक्स ग्राफिक्स प्रोसेसर भी है जो ग्राफिक्स को बेहतर करता है । पर इस्तेमाल करने वाले के पास दो जीबी इंटरनल मेमोरी उपलब्ध होगी इसलिए इसे खरीदते ही एक मेमोरी कार्ड तो आपको डलवाना ही पड़ेगा जिसका अतिरिक्त खर्चा इसी की कीमत में जोड़कर अपना टैबलेट खरीदने का बजट बनाएं । कनेक्टिवीटि के सिम वाइ फाइ ब्लू टूथ आदि कई विकल्प हैं । इसमें एफएम रेडियो भी है जो बहुत से टैबलेट में अक्सर नहीं मिलता है । इसमें एफएम में चल रहे पसंदीदा गानों को रिकार्ड भी कर सकते हैं और इसमें लगा स्कैनर सभी उपलब्ध एफ एम चैनलों की खुद ब खुद स्कैनिंग करता है । इस टैबलेट में मौजूद एक खास किस्म के ट्रांसमीटर की मदद से आप अपनी पसंद का म्यूज़िक घर कार यां एफएम पर ट्रांसफर कर सकते हैं । इस टैबलेट में एंड्रायड आइसक्रीम सैंडविच आपरेटिंग साफ्टवेयर है । गेमिंग और संगीत का शौंक रखने वालों के लिए तथा टैबलेट में कालिंग सुविधा चाहने वालों के लिए यह अच्छा विकल्प है । लेकिन सिंगल कोर प्रोसेसर के कारण रोजमर्रा के काम और कई एप्लीकेशन एक साथ चलाने की जरूरत जिन्हें है उन्हें इसी कीमत में अथवास इससे कुछ अधिक में डयूअल कोर प्रोसेसर मिल सकता है । इसके अलावा फोन की इंटरनल मेमोरी भी केवल जीबी की है । अगर आप इसे जीबी तक अपग्रेड करना चाहेंगे तो दो से तीन हजार रुपये अतिरिक्त खर्च आएगा । हमारे हिसाब से इस कीमत में कुछ और अन्य विकल्पों को जांच कर ही इसे खरीदने का मन बनाएं तो बेहतर होगा । इस टैबलेट में सात इंच की स्क्रीन है और एंड्रायड जैली बीन आपरेटिंग सिस्टम है । टैबलेट की स्पीड अच्छी है क्योंकि इसमें गीगाहर्टज कोरटेक्स श्रेणी का प्रोसेसर है और जीबी रैम है । लेकिन माइक्रोमैक्स ने इतनी कम कीमत में जीबी रैम देकर दूसरी कई कम्पनियों के लिए कड़ी चुनौती पेश की है । इसमें सिम कार्ड के लिए भी स्लाट है जिससे टैबलेट का इस्तेमाल करने वालों को इसी से कालिंग की सुविधा भी मिलेगी । इस श्रेणी के ज्यादातर टैबलेट में अब तक केवल डोंगल के सहारे इंटरनेट की सुविधा मिलती थी और कालिंग का विकल्प भी ज्यादातर माडल में नहीं है । लेकिन इस टैबलेट में बेहतर क्षमता वाली रैम सिम कार्ड स्लाट और कालिंग की सुविधा देकर माइक्रोमैक्स से हजार रुपये कीमत वाले टैबलेट् को भी कड़ी टक्कर देगा । इस माडल में गुणा पिक्सल के रिजोल्यूशन के चलते स्क्रीन पर औसत डिस्प्ले मिलता है । इसकी इंटरनल मेमोरी जीबी है जिसमें से इस्तेमाल करने के लिए केवल जीबी मेमोरी ही उपलब्ध है । ऐसे में इस माडल को खरीदने के साथ ही आपको कम से कम जीबी का एक माइक्रोएसबी कार्ड खरीदना पड़ेगा जिसका मतलब है से रुपये का अतिरिक्त खर्च । वैसे इसमें जीबी तक का माइक्रोएसडी कार्ड लगा कर मेमोरी अपग्रेड की जा सकती है । कैमरे की क्षमता बहुत अच्छी नहीं है । इंटरनेट के लिए सिम कार्ड का उपयोग किया जा सकता है लेकिन केवल नेटवर्क ही इस पर काम करेगा । अगर नेटवर्क चाहिए तो बाहर से डोंगल लगानी पड़ेगी । वाइ फाइ और ब्लूटूथ की सुविधा भी इसमें मौजूद है । सिम कार्ड से नेटवर्क कनेक्ट करने का विकल्प नहीं है जो इस टैबलेट की सबसे बड़ी कमजोरियों में से एक है क्योंकि ज्यादातर लोग अच्छी स्पीड के चलते इंटरनेट के लिए नेटवर्क का उपयोग करते हैं । अगर आप पहली बार टैबलेट खरीद करहे हैं और आपका बजट हजार रुपये से नीचे है तो इसे खरीदना बुरा विकल्प नहीं है । स्पीड ठीक ठाक होने के कारण गेमिंग का ठीक ठाक मज़ा इस पर मिल सकता है । लेकिन ग्राफिक्स बहुत ज्यादा अच्छी गुणवत्ता के नहीं दिखेंगे । ध्यान रहे कि इस टैबलेट की बैटरी थोड़ी कमजोर है इसलिए लगातार इस्तेमाल करने पर दिन में एक से ज्यादा बार भी चार्ज करना पड़ सकता है । लेकिन कुल मिलाकर इस कीमत में यह औसत से कुछ बेहतर श्रेणी का टैबलेट है । हजार की कीमत के साथ लेनोवो योगा को आइपैड रेटिना या सैमसंग टैब या आने वाले नेक्सस से बड़ी प्रतिस्पर्धा मिल सकती है । फिर भी लेनोवो योगा टैबलेट एक अच्छा सौदा साबित होता है । खासकर व्यावहारिक प्रयोगों में बाजार के अन्य उत्पादों से कहीं बेहतर है लेकिन एंड्रॉयड यूआई की तरह प्रयोग में आसान नहीं है । लेनोवो योगा टैबलेट से दिखने में थोड़ा अलग है और आकार में बहुत बड़ा नजर आता है । शुरुआत में टैबलेट का लुक अच्छा लगता है लेकिन जब इसे प्रयोग करते हैं तो इसमें कुछ कमियां नजर आती हैं जिनपर ध्यान दिए जाने की जरूरत थी । लेनोवो योगा टैबलेट का डिजाइन अब तक के सबसे अच्छे टैबलेट डिजाइन में माना जा सकता है । पिछले जेन के लेनोवो योगा टैबलेट का ही यह परिष्कृत रूप है । योगा की तरह ही इस बार भी इसमें किकस्टैंड हैं लीकिन इस बार हैंग का एक और पोजीशन जोड़ा गया है । लेनोवो की पुराने वाइब एक्स की तर्ह इसमें भी खुरदरी सिल्वर फिनिश का प्लास्टिक बैक दिया गया है । मेटल किक स्टैंड और प्रभावशाली डिजाइन के साथ लैपटॉप प्रीमियम होने का एहसास देता है । पूरा एमएएच की बैटरी को लेनोवो ने इसमें स्क्रीन के सबसे बाईं ओर रखा है । इस कारण बस इसी ओर से यह भारी भी महसूस होता है और दूसरी तरफ से पकड़ने की कोशिश करने पर पूरी तरह हल्का महसूस होता है । डिस्प्ले को इस तरह बनाया गया है कि इसे पकड़ने में आपको परेशानी नहीं आती है । डिस्प्ले क्वालिटी की बात करें तो यह ब्राइट है और तेज धूप में भी इसमें विजिबिलिटी की दिक्कत नहीं आती । हालांकि इसमें फिंगरप्रिंट मैग्नेट का प्रयोग किया गया है और यह थोड़ा रिफ्लेक्टिव भी है । एंड्रॉयड किटकैट पर चलने वाले इस टैबलेट में उच्च श्रेणी का कस्ट्माइज्ड यूआई प्रयोग किया गया है । इसका ब्लोटवेयर बहुत ज्यादा है और लेनोवो ने अपने यूआई को आईओएस की तरह बनाने की बहुत कोशिश की है और उसी की तरह इसमें भी कोई एप ड्रॉअर नहीं है । हालांकि इससे इसके फंक्शन्स पर कोई असर नहीं पड़ता सिवा इसके कि हम एप ड्रॉअर और एंड्रॉयड की तरह अगर इसका यूआई होता तो शायद हमें ज्यादा पसंद आता । गीगा हर्ट्ज का इंटेल प्रोसेसर कई बडे टास्क को एक साथ हैंडल कर सकता है । एसफाल्ट खेलते हुए मूवी देखते हुए या यहां तक कि गूगल डॉक्स पर यह रिव्यू लिखते हुए भी कहीं कोई समस्या नहीं है । टैबलेट स्क्रीन के एक तरफ स्टीरिओ स्पीकर जो वीडियो देखते के लिए अच्छा है पर गाने सुनने के लिए इसे बहुत अच्छा नहीं माना जा सकता । सिंथेटिक बेंचमार्क पर टैबलेट ने अच्छा स्कोर किया । टैबलेट से जुड़ा इंटेल चिप दूसरे डिवाइसेस के मुकाबले इसे ठंढा रखता है । लेनोवो योगा का बैटरी परफॉर्मेंस निश्चय ही बहुत बढ़िया है । पूरी तरह चार्ज किया हुआ यह टैबलेट हमारे टेस्ट में तीन दिनों से बस कुछ ही घंटे कम चला । लेनोवो योगा का मेगा पिक्सल का कैमरा पर्याप्त रूप से अच्छा है कि कभी कभार किसी विशेष अवसर पर आप अच्छी लाइट में इससे अच्छे पिक्चर्स ले सकते हैं । हालांकि सब्जेक्ट को फोकस करने में यह बहुत समय लगाता है और क्लिक किए पिक्चर्स थोड़े धुंधले भी होते हैं । वीडियो क्वालिटी बहुत अच्छी नहीं है और बेहतर होगा अगर आप इसके लिए अपना स्मार्टफोन कैमरा ही प्रयोग करें । कम रौशनी में भी आप इससे अच्छे पिक्चर्स नहीं ले सकते । इसके अलावे फ्रंट कैमरा भी बस वीडियो चैट के लिए ही काम आने लायक है । लेनोवो योगा एक अच्छे टैबलेट की श्रेणी में आता है । किकस्टैंड से इसकी उपयोगिता और भी ज्यादा हो जाती है । यह साधारण सा स्टैंड आपको टैबलेट को विविध रूपों में उपयोग कर सकने की आजादी देता है । इसलिए अगर आप एंड्रॉयड टैबलेट लेने का मन बना रहे हैं लेकिन एंड्रॉयड यूआई आपको बहुत अधिक पसंद नहीं है तो आप निश्चित रूप से लेनोवो योगा खरीद सकते हैं । अच्छी बैटरी क्षमता है । बढिया परफॉर्मेंस है । फ्रंट कैमरा की खराब क्वालिटी है । और स्टैण्डर्ड सिम कार्ड के साथ वॉ यस कालिंग क्षमता है । मेगापिक्सेल रियर कैमरा और मेगापिक्सेल फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा है । सैमसंग गैलेक्सी नोट एक बेहतरीन एंड्रायड टेबलेट है जो अपने शक्तिशाली परफॉरमेंस से बहुत से अच्छे टेबलेट्स को भी पीछे छोड़ देता है । इस टेबलेट में सब कुछ है जैसे बहुत अच्छी शक्ति बेहतरीन डिस्प्ले और अच्छी बैटरी लाइफ । इसमें सिर्फ एक ही कमी है और वो है इसकी अच्छी बनावट का ना होना । लेकिन इसकी बहुत सी खूबियों को देखते हुए इस कमी को अनदेखा किया जा सकता है । अगर आप एक प्रीमियम एंड्रायड डिवाइस खरीदना चाहते हैं तो इस टेबलेट को आप अवश्य खरीदें । सैमसंग गैलेक्सी नोट में का डिस्प्ले फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा लाइट सेंसर और स्क्रीन के दोनों तरफ दो स्पीकर्स हैं । इस टेबलेट की बनावट काफी प्लास्टिक फील देता है जो अच्छा नहीं दिखाई देता । हलांकि प्लास्टिक के इस्तेमाल से यह टेबलेट ग्राम से कम वज़न के साथ काफी हल्का है लेकिन यह इसे एक प्रीमियम फील बिल्कुल नहीं देता । इस टेबलेट के ऊपर के हिस्से में पॉवर / स्लीप / वेक बटन वॉल्यूम रॉकर माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड स्लॉट आईआर बीम जिससे आप इस डिवाइस को एक रिमोट की तरह इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं है डफ़ोन्स जैक और सिम कार्ड स्लॉट हैं । इस टेबलेट में दिए गए सिम कार्ड स्लॉट का इस्तेमाल ना सिर्फ डेटा के लिए हो सकता है बल्कि इससे आप कॉल भी कर सकते हैं । गैलेक्सी नोट के साथ कोई ईयरपीस नहीं दिया गया है लेकिन कॉल के लिए आप इसके स्पीकर का इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं और अगर आप प्राइवेसी चाहते हैं तो इसके साथ दिए गए है डफ़ोन्स का इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं । इस टेबलेट में नीचे के हिस्से में दाहिनी तरफ एस पेन भी दिया गया है । इसका आकार गैलेक्सी नोट से काफी बड़ा है और इसकी बनावट काफी अच्छी है । भले ही इस डिवाइस की बनावट बहुत अच्छी ना हो लेकिन शक्ति के मामले में गैलेक्सी नोट अपने प्रतियोगियों को बिल्कुल पीछे छोड़ देता है । इसमें जीबी रैम के साथ गीगाहर्ट्ज़ एक्सीनस क्वाड कोर प्रोसेसर है । इसमें माली ग्राफ़िक्स है । गैलेक्सी नोट में दिए गए जीबी रैम का इसके परफॉरमेंस पर असर बिल्कुल साफ़ दिखाई देता है । गैलेक्सी नोट में इसके ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम को सैमसंग के टचविज़ यूजर इंटरफ़ेस के साथ स्किन किया गया है । सैमसंग के टचविज़ यूजर इंटरफ़ेस में कस्टमाइजेशन के लिए पर्याप्त स्कोप है । गैलेक्सी नोट का लॉक स्क्रीन सिंपल और अच्छा है । इस टेबलेट के डिस्प्ले में किसी भी ज़गह पर स्वाइप करके इसके स्क्रीन को अनलॉक किया जा सकता है । इसमें होम स्क्रीन के नीचे के हिस्से में सामान्य एंड्रायड बटन बैक होम और मल्टीटास्किंग हैं । गैलेक्सी नोट में एक बहुत उपयोगी फीचर एस पेन दिया गया है । जैसे ही आप इस एस पेन को इसके होल्डर से बाहर निकालते है इस टेबलेट के स्क्रीन के दाहिनी तरफ कोने में एक मीनू खुल जाता है । यह मीनू एस नोट्स एस प्लानर क्रेयान फिजिक्स फोटोशॉप टच और पेन सेटिंग्स तक पहुंचने के लिए एक शॉर्टकट की तरह काम करता है । यह मीनू आपको उन एप्स तक तुरंत पहुंचा देता है जो एस पेन के काम करने के दायरे में आते हैं । इसमें कमी यह है की यह मीनू अपने पसंद के एप्स को शामिल करने के लिए कस्टमाइज नहीं किया जा सकता है । गैलेक्सी नोट का डिस्प्ले काफी अच्छा है । इसमें पिक्सेल रेजोल्यूशन का डिस्प्ले है जो ट्रांसफार्मर प्राइम में भी है लेकिन यह आईपैड के डिस्प्ले से काफी पीछे है । लेकिन इसका स्क्रीन रेजोल्यूशन कम होने के बावजूद इसके डिस्प्ले का परफॉरमेंस बहुत अच्छा है । इसमें ब्लैक लेवल काफी गहरे हैं और इसमें देखने का एंगल अब तक के सर्वोत्तम में से एक है । चाहे टेक्स्ट इमेज या वीडियो की बात हो इसका डिस्प्ले हर मामले में काफी अच्छा साबित होता है । बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में गैलेक्सी नोट का परफॉरमेंस शानदार है । हमने इस टेबलेट पर बहुत से गेम्स और एप्स चलाये और वे इस पर बहुत आसानी से चले । इस टेबलेट पर मल्टीमीडिया देखना काफी मजेदार अनुभव है । इस डिवाइस में स्पीकर्स सामने होने के कारण इसकी आवाज़ काफी अच्छी रहती है और इसलिए इस पर गेम्स या एप्स चलाना या मूवी देखना काफी अच्छा रहता है । सैमसंग ने गैलेक्सी नोट के साथ एक नया फीचर मल्टीस्क्रीन प्रस्तुत किया है । इसमें स्क्रीन पर एक साथ दो एप्स चला सकते हैं । गैलेक्सी नोट में एमएएच की बैटरी दी गई है । हमने इस पर एचडी वीडियो फुल ब्राइटनेस और फुल वॉल्यूम पर चलाया और इसकी बैटरी लगभग घंटे तक चलती है । यह एक काफी अच्छा बैटरी परफॉरमेंस है । सामान्य इस्तेमाल में इस टेबलेट की बैटरी दो दिन तक चल जाती है और फिर भी इसमें प्रतिशत तक बैटरी लाइफ शेष रहती है । सैमसंग गैलेक्सी नोट एक बहुत अच्छे परफॉरमेंस वाला बेहतरीन टेबलेट है । इस टेबलेट में वो सब कुछ है जो आप चाहते है । यह बहुत शक्तिशाली है और इसका डिस्प्ले शानदार है । इसकी बैटरी लाइफ भी काफी अच्छी है । इस टेबलेट में एस पेन के साथ और कई अच्छे फीचर्स हैं । इसमें सिर्फ एक ही कमी है कि इसकी बनावट की क्वालिटी बहुत अच्छी नहीं है । अगर आप एक अच्छे परफॉरमेंस वाला प्रीमियम एंड्रायड डिवाइस चाहते हैं तो आप इस टेबलेट को अवश्य खरीदें । मेगापिक्सेल का रियर कैमरा और मेगापिक्सेल का फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा है वाई फाई ब्लूटूथ है । वज़न पौंड है । दो साल के भीतर इसका चौथा वर्ज़न पेश होने के बावजूद एपल आईपैड की बादशाहत अभी भी बरक़रार है । एपल आईपैड इस समय उपलब्ध सर्वोत्तम बड़ा टेबलेट है जिसे आप खरीद सकते हैं । इसमें सब कुछ बेहतरीन है जैसे सर्वोत्तम परफॉरमेंस बेहतरीन डिस्प्ले आश्चर्यजनक रूप से अच्छा कैमरा तेज़ वाई फाई और शानदार एप्स वाली बड़ी लाइब्रेरी । बाज़ार में उपलब्ध अन्य वाले टेबलेट्स से अलग एपल आईपैड पूरे पैकेज के साथ है जो इसे एक बहुत खास फाइव स्टार प्रोडक्ट बनाता है और यह एडिटर्स चॉइस के लिए एक विश्वशनीय दावा पेश करता है । आईपैड पुराने आईपैड की तरह ही आईओएस पर काम करता है । आईफ़ोन में लगा प्रोसेसर भी काफी शक्तिशाली था । आईपैड में लगा प्रोसेसर उससे भी बेहतर है और इससे ग्राफ़िक्स बहुत शानदार आते हैं । बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में एपल आईपैड के शानदार परिणाम आते हैं । यह चौथी पीढ़ी का आईपैड गीकबेंच और जीएलबेंचमार्क स्कोर में बाकी सभी एपल प्रोडक्ट्स को पीछे छोड़ देता है । हां यह दूने से भी ज्यादा तेज़ है । हमने देखा कि जो एप्स आईपैड के प्रोसेसर को मुश्किल में डाल दे रहे थे उन्हें आईपैड पर चलने में कोई परेशानी नहीं हुई । एपल आईपैड का गेमिंग परफॉरमेंस भी काफी बेहतर है । बहुत भारी गेम्स भी जैसे नीड फॉर स्पीड और एस्फाल्ट भी फ्रेम प्रति सेकेंड के हिसाब से इस पर काफी अच्छी तरह से चलते हैं । जीएलबेंचमार्क ग्राफ़िक्स टेस्ट के स्कोर इस बात के गवाह हैं कि आईपैड का गेमिंग परफॉरमेंस बाकी सभी डिवाइस से काफी बेहतर रहा है । नए आईपैड में मेगापिक्सेल का फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा है जो वीडियो रिकॉर्ड कर सकता है । इसका रियर कैमरा मेगापिक्सेल का है जो फुल एचडी वीडियो रिकॉर्ड कर सकता है । इसका कैमरा एपल आईपैड मिनी की तरह ही बेहतरीन परफॉरमेंस देता है । इसके मेगापिक्सेल कैमरे से लिये गए फोटो और फ्रेम प्रति सेकेंड वाले वीडियो काफी शार्प क्लियर और संतुलित हैं । हम एपल आईपैड को सर्वोत्तम के टेबलेट की रेटिंग दे रहे हैं जबकि इसका छोटा स्वरूप आईपैड मिनी सबसे अच्छा का टेबलेट नहीं है । आईपैड का परफॉरमेंस अन्य सारे प्रतियोगियों की तुलना में बहुत आगे है और इसके अधिक कीमत के अनुरूप ही इसमें प्रीमियम स्क्रीन और प्रोसेसर हैं । टेबलेट के इस्तेमाल के लिए बनीं आईपैड के एप्स की लाइब्रेरी लोगों के लिए काफी उपयोगी साबित होती है । कुल मिलाकर चौथी पीढ़ी का यह एपल आईपैड एकमात्र ऐसा प्रोडक्ट है जिसे हमने पूरे पांच स्टार दिए हैं क्योंकि यह टेबलेट्स के लिए एक प्रतिमान स्थापित करता है । सोनी का एक्सपीरिया टेबलेट जेड इस समय भारत में उपलब्ध सर्वोत्तम एंड्रायड टेबलेट है जिसे आप खरीद सकते हैं । इसमें बहुत सारे फीचर्स हैं जैसे खास भारत के लिये बने कंटेंट एक अच्छा स्किन पतला और सुन्दर आकार और इसके अन्दर अच्छी शक्ति । इसमें कमी यह है कि इसे एंड्रायड अपडेट मिलने में देरी हो सकती है और इसके अन्दर सिर्फ जीबी का ही स्टोरेज है । लेकिन यह टेबलेट बहुत शक्तिशाली खूबसूरत और पानी से सुरक्षित है । अगर कीमत आपके लिए कोई समस्या नहीं है तो आप इस डिवाइस पर विचार कर सकते हैं । यह टेबलेट एपल आईपैड का एक काफी योग्य प्रतियोगी है । सोनी एक्सपीरिया टेबलेट जेड एमएम मोटाई के साथ बाज़ार में उपलब्ध सबसे पतला टेबलेट है । ग्राम वज़न के साथ यह काफी हल्का टेबलेट है । यह एंड्रायड जेली बीन ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम पर काम करता है और इसके ओएस पर स्किन है । इस टेबलेट के साथ बहुत सारे खास भारत के लिए बने कंटेंट जैसे सोनी टीवी शोज और म्यूजिक कंटेंट आदि हैं । इस टेबलेट से सोनी के गेम्स की लाइब्रेरी को भी इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है । यह टेबलेट यूनिवर्सल रिमोट की तरह काम कर सकता है और यह पानी से सुरक्षित भी है । सोनी एक्सपीरिया टेबलेट जेड एक ऐसा डिवाइस है जो हमें देखते ही बहुत पसंद आया । यह टेबलेट वास्तव में बहुत पतला और हल्का है । इसकी सबसे अच्छी बात यह है की ये पकड़ने में बहुत आरामदेह है क्योंकि इसके पीछे के हिस्से में बहुत ही स्मूद रबर फिनिश है । इस टेबलेट में पीछे बाएं किनारे पर कैमरा है लेकिन इसके साथ फ़्लैश नहीं है । एक्सपीरिया टेबलेट जेड में सामने का डिस्प्ले फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा है और कोई फिजिकल बटन नहीं है । इसका डिस्प्ले चिकना है और इस पर उंगलियों के निशान आसानी से लग जाते हैं । इस टेबलेट में बायीं तरफ पॉवर बटन

सोनी एक्सपीरिया टेबलेट जेड की डिज़ाइन बहुत खूबसूरत सिंपल और सुविधाजनक है । बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में एक्सपीरिया जेड का परफॉरमेंस बहुत शानदार रहता है । इस टेबलेट के अन्दर अच्छी शक्ति होने के कारण हमें इसके अच्छे प्रदर्शन पर कोई आश्चर्य नहीं है । वास्तविक इस्तेमाल में भी एक्सपीरिया टेबलेट जेड का परफॉरमेंस शानदार रहता है । हलांकि कुछ मौकों पर इसमें बहुत मामूली सी देरी होती है लेकिन यह कोई बड़ी बात नहीं है । कुल मिलाकर इसका परफॉरमेंस बेहतरीन है । एक्सपीरिया टेबलेट जेड का कीबोर्ड काफी अच्छा है और इस पर टाइप करना काफी सुविधाजनक रहता है । इसके टचस्क्रीन का रिस्पोंस भी बहुत अच्छा है और इसे इस्तेमाल करना बहुत मज़ेदार रहता है । इसके डिस्प्ले का रेजोल्यूशन आईपैड के रेटिना डिस्प्ले जितना तो नहीं है लेकिन फिर भी यह काफी आकर्षक है । इस पर वीडियो तीक्ष्ण और क्रिस्प दिखाई देते हैं और इसका देखने का एंगल भी काफी बढ़िया है । इस टेबलेट के अन्दर अच्छी शक्ति होने के कारण इस पर गेम्स बहुत अच्छी तरह से चलते हैं । रीयल रेसिंग डेड ट्रिगर एंग्री बर्ड्स आदि सभी गेम्स इस पर बहुत अच्छी तरह चलते हैं । अच्छा और रिस्पोंसिव डिस्प्ले और अच्छी आवाज़ और अच्छा परफॉरमेंस होने के कारण इस पर गेम्स चलाना एक बहुत आनंद देने वाला अनुभव है । इस टेबलेट की एक और खास बात है इसका वाटर रेसिस्टेंट होना । इसलिए अगर यह टेबलेट पानी में भीग भी जाये तो आपको चिंता करने की ज़रूरत नहीं है । एक्सपीरिया टेबलेट जेड में सोनी के एक्समोर टेक्नोलॉजी से युक्त मेगापिक्सेल का कैमरा है । दिन के समय अच्छी रोशनी में इसके कैमरे से लिए गए इमेज क्रिस्प शार्प और अच्छे हैं । कम रोशनी में इससे लिए गए इमेज मध्यम स्तर के हैं ये ना तो ख़राब हैं और ना ही बहुत अच्छे । इस टेबलेट में फ़्लैश का ना होना भी इसका एक कारण बनता है । यह बहुत अच्छी बात है कि सोनी ने टेबलेट के कैमरे में भी अच्छा सेंसर दिया हुआ है जिससे अच्छे फोटो आते हैं । हमारे लगातार वीडियो प्लेबैक टेस्ट में एक्सपीरिया टेबलेट जेड की बैटरी लगभग घंटे तक चलती है जो कि एक मध्यम स्तर का बैटरी परफॉरमेंस है । सोनी एक्सपीरिया टेबलेट जेड को बहुत आसानी से इस समय भारत में उपलब्ध सर्वोत्तम खरीदा जा सकने वाला एंड्रायड टेबलेट कहा जा सकता है । इसमें बहुत से फीचर्स के साथ खूबसूरत बनावट और डिज़ाइन शानदार डिस्प्ले बेहतरीन परफॉरमेंस के साथ एक अच्छा कैमरा भी है । इसका आकार बहुत अच्छा है और यह काफी पतला टेबलेट है । यह टेबलेट बहुत शक्तिशाली है और यह पानी से भी सुरक्षित है । लेकिन इसमें कमी यह है कि इसमें सिर्फ जीबी का आतंरिक स्टोरेज दिया गया है । कुल मिलाकर हम यह कह सकते हैं कि अगर एक्सपीरिया टेबलेट जेड की कीमत आपके लिए कोई समस्या नहीं है तो आप इसे खरीदने के लिए अवश्य विचार कर सकते हैं । गूगल नेक्सस में आपको एंड्रायड का बेहतरीन अनुभव मिलता है । इसमें जेली बीन ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम होने के कारण एंड्रायड का अनुभव और ज्यादा स्मूद हो गया है । इसमें टेगरा प्रोसेसर होने के कारण यह काफी तेज़ है । इसका आईपीएस डिस्प्ले काफी अच्छा है लेकिन इसका अत्यधिक रिफ्लेक्टिव होना इसकी एकमात्र कमी है । नेक्सस में कोई माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड स्लॉट नहीं दिया गया है इसलिए इसके स्टोरेज को बढ़ाने का कोई सवाल नहीं है । नेक्सस को आसुस के द्वारा बनाया गया है और यह बाज़ार में उपलब्ध पहला ऑफिसियल एंड्रायड जेली बीन टेबलेट है । आसुस द्वारा बनाया गया गूगल नेक्सस टेबलेट बहुत अच्छी तरह से आपकी हथेली में आ जाता है । इसके पीछे

कारण इसे आप काफी देर तक एक हाथ में पकड़ सकते है । इसका वज़न नए आईपैड की तुलना में लगभग आधा है और यह अन्य उपलब्ध टेबलेट्स से भी हल्का है । असल में यह हमारा टेस्ट किया हुआ अब तक का सबसे हल्का टेबलेट है ।

। इसके डिस्प्ले में कोरनिंग गोरिला ग्लास प्रोटेक्शन दिया गया है जिससे यह खरोंच आदि से सुरक्षित है । यह रेटिना डिस्प्ले जैसा तो नहीं है लेकिन फिर भी काफी अच्छा पीपीआई का पिक्सेल डेंसिटी देता है । इसके डिस्प्ले के सतह पर कोई बटन नहीं है । इस टेबलेट में मेगापिक्सेल का फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा है लेकिन इसमें कोई रियर कैमरा नहीं है । होने की वज़ह से नेक्सस का देखने का एंगल बहुत शानदार है । इसमें एक बात जो हमें बिल्कुल पसंद नहीं आई वो ये है कि इसका डिस्प्ले बहुत ज्यादा रिफ्लेक्टिव है । नेक्सस टेबलेट में गीगाहर्ट्ज़ एनवीडिया टेगरा क्वाड कोर प्रोसेसर है । इसमें जीबी रैम है इसमें एंड्रायड जेली बीन ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम है । नेक्सस में प्रोजेक्ट बटर फीचर है जो इस टेबलेट के रिस्पोंस में काफी सुधार करता है । जेली बीन ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम होने के कारण इसके विजेट्स को कस्टमाइज किया जा सकता है । इसमें एक बहुत उपयोगी फीचर गूगल नाउ है जो सर्च करने में काफी सहायता पहुंचाता है । गूगल नाउ खास आपके लोकेशन के आधार पर चीजों को सर्च कर सकता है और उनके बारे में आपको पर्याप्त जानकारी उपलब्ध कराता है । यह एक काफी अच्छा फीचर है । नोटिफिकेशन के मामले में भी इस ओएस में काफी सुधार हुआ है और अब आपको इसमें ज्यादा जानकारी मिलेगी । इसमें एक बहुत अच्छा वॉयस कंट्रोल फीचर है जिसके द्वारा आप गाने सुनने किसी लोकेशन का मैप पाने ईमेल भेजने वेबसाइट आदि पर जाने के लिए आप सिर्फ बोल कर ही इसे आदेश दे सकते हैं । बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में गूगल नेक्सस काफी अच्छा परफॉर्म करता है । हलांकि इसका परफॉरमेंस नए आईपैड की तुलना में कम है लेकिन बाज़ार में उपलब्ध अन्य बहुत से एंड्रायड टेबलेट्स की तुलना में इसका परफॉरमेंस काफी अच्छा रहता है । नेक्सस पर मूवी देखना काफी अच्छा अनुभव रहता है जब तक कि आपके पीछे कोई लाइट ना जल रही हो क्योंकि इसका स्क्रीन अत्यधिक रिफ्लेक्टिव है । कभी कभी बहुत डार्क सीन में हमें स्क्रीन पर अपनी परछाईं दिखाई देती है । नेक्सस टेबलेट में दिया गया टेगरा क्वाड कोर प्रोसेसर इसका बेहतरीन मल्टीटास्किंग सुनिश्चित कर देता है । हमें इस पर एप्स खोलने बैकग्राउंड में डाउनलोड करने यूट्यूब चलाने के बाद भी इस डिवाइस के परफॉरमेंस में किसी तरह का धीमापन नज़र नहीं आया । एनवीडिया टेगरा प्रोसेसर इस टेबलेट के बेहतरीन ग्राफ़िक्स परफॉरमेंस को भी सुनिश्चित करता है । नेक्सस पर डेड ट्रिगर और एंग्री बर्ड्स स्पेस आदि गेम्स बहुत अच्छी तरह से चलते हैं और इन्हें चलाना काफी मज़ेदार है । सामान्य वॉल्यूम पर नेक्सस की आवाज़ अच्छी है लेकिन अधिक वॉल्यूम पर इसकी आवाज़ फटने लगती है । नेक्सस में एमएएच की बैटरी है जो लगातार इस्तेमाल में घंटे तक आराम से चल जाती है । हमने महसूस किया कि यह डिवाइस गेम चलाते समय या एचडी मूवी देखते समय हल्का सा गर्म हो जाता है । अगर आपको टेबलेट पर एंड्रायड का बेहतरीन अनुभव चाहिए तो आपको गूगल नेक्सस अवश्य खरीदना चाहिए । इसका जेली बीन ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम एंड्रायड का बढ़िया अनुभव देता है और टेगरा क्वाड कोर प्रोसेसर इस टेबलेट को काफी सक्षम और तेज़ बनाता है । इसके आईपीएस डिस्प्ले में देखने का एंगल बहुत अच्छा है लेकिन इसमें कमी यह है कि यह पैनल काफी रिफ्लेक्टिव है । हमारे द्वारा टेस्ट किये गए के टेबलेट्स में से यह एक बेहतरीन टेबलेट है । कुल मिलाकर नेक्सस कम कीमत में उपलब्ध एक बहुत अच्छा परफॉरमेंस देने वाला टेबलेट है जिसे खरीदने का निर्णय लेते समय आपको अवश्य ध्यान में रखना चाहिए । इस समय रु के ख़ास ऑफर पर डिजिफलीप

है जैसा कि बजट टेबलेट्स में अक्सर देखने को मिलता है । यह टेबलेट हाथ में लेने पर भारी महसूस होता है जबकि यह सिर्फ ग्राम का है । दूसरी बात यह कि इसकी बनावट बेहद शानदार है । जिंक क्वाड में सामने की तरफ फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा है और इस पर कोई फिजिकल बटन नहीं है । इसका सामने का हिस्सा सामान्य काले रंग में है । इस टेबलेट के डिस्प्ले पर उंगलियों के निशान बहुत आसानी से पड़ जाते हैं । इस टेबलेट के पीछे का हिस्सा मेटल का बना हुआ है और इस टेबलेट की बनावट काफी अच्छी है । पीछे का हिस्सा मेटल का होने के कारण यह टेबलेट बहुत अच्छा फील देता है । जिंक क्वाड के पीछे के हिस्से में ही बिना फ़्लैश का रियर कैमरा भी है । कनेक्टिविटी के मामले में इस टेबलेट के नीचे के हिस्से में माइक्रो यूएसबी पोर्ट एचडीएमआई आउट और मेमोरी कार्ड स्लॉट हैं । इस टेबलेट के उपरी हिस्से में पॉवर बटन और है डफ़ोन्स जैक हैं जबकि दाहिनी तरफ

इस्तेमाल में जिंक क्वाड का टचस्क्रीन बहुत अच्छा रिस्पोंस देता है । इसमें कभी कभी थोड़ी रुकावट आती है लेकिन इसके अलावा इसका परफॉरमेंस काफी स्मूद है । इस टेबलेट का कीबोर्ड टाइप करने के लिए काफी अच्छा और आरामदेह है । जिंक क्वाड पर सभी वीडियो चाहे वो एसडी हो या एचडी सब बहुत आसानी से चलते हैं । इसके डिस्प्ले में रंग काफी क्रिस्प आते है लेकिन यह थोड़ा कम ब्राइट है । हमें इससे बेहतर ब्राइटनेस वाले टेबलेट देखने को मिले हैं । इसके डिस्प्ले पर देखने का एंगल काफी अच्छा है और इस पर मूवी आदि देखने का अनुभव काफी अच्छा रहता है । लेकिन बाहर धूप में इस पर उतना बेहतर नहीं दिखाई देता । इसके स्पीकर्स की आवाज़ पर्याप्त तेज़ नहीं है जितना कि इसे होना चाहिए । हमारे लगातार वीडियो प्लेबैक टेस्ट में जिंक क्वाड बहुत आसानी से घंटे तक चल जाता है जो कि काफी अच्छा है । इस पर मल्टीमीडिया और एप्स बहुत अच्छी तरह चलते हैं और इसके अन्दर अच्छी मल्टीटास्किंग की क्षमता मौजूद है । इसका बैटरी परफॉरमेंस भी काफी अच्छा है । इसमें कमी यह है कि इसकी आवाज़ बहुत बेहतर नहीं है और यह कभी कभी क्रैश कर जाता है । इसकी सबसे खास बात आईपैड मिनी की अविश्वशनीय और बेहतरीन बनावट और साथ ही अत्यधिक मात्रा में एप्स की उपलब्धता है । एपल आईपैड मिनी मेरा देखा हुआ अब तक का सबसे खूबसूरत डिवाइस हो सकता है । यह इंच मोटाई के साथ आश्चर्जनक रूप से पतला है और औंस वज़न के साथ अत्यधिक हल्का है । आईफ़ोन की तरह ही इसमें एल्यूमीनियम बॉडी में इसका चमकदार डिस्प्ले है । आईपैड मिनी लेटेस्ट आईपैड और अन्य सभी हाई एंड टेबलेट्स से भी सालों आगे नज़र आता है । बाकी सारे टेबलेट्स अब इसके आगे बिल्कुल फीके नज़र आते हैं । यह डिवाइस आईपैड के छोटे स्वरूप जैसा लगता है । वही एप्स वही स्क्रीन रेजोल्यूशन वही परफॉरमेंस । इसमें आईपैड की तुलना में हर चीज थोड़ी छोटी और थोड़ी शार्प है लेकिन यह रेटिना डिस्प्ले नहीं है । जैसा कि एपल ने बार बार स्टेज पर बताया कि इसके पास आईपैड के लिए खास तौर पर डिज़ाइन किये गए एप्स हैं जो एंड्रायड टेबलेट एप्स को बहुत पीछे छोड़ छोड़ देते हैं । टेबलेट्स के लिए बने एप्स ही इस पर अच्छे लगते हैं और यह एपल के पास काफी बड़ी मात्रा में है । आईपैड मिनी में दो कमियाँ नज़र आती हैं । जब डेवलपर आईपैड के लिए एप्स बनाते हैं तो वे हर इंच में कुछ निश्चित पिक्सेल का ध्यान रखते हैं । आईपैड मिनी में छोटे आकार के कारण टच बटन के लिए कम जगह उपलब्ध है । बड़े आईपैड में आप अपनी उंगलियों को बहुत आसानी से घुमा सकते हैं लेकिन छोटे आईपैड में इसके लिए आपको थोड़ा सावधान रहना पड़ता है । हलांकि यह निर्धारित करने में थोड़ा वक्त लगेगा की क्या यह बात इसकी उपयोगिता में कोई खास अंतर पैदा करता है या नहीं । आईपैड मिनी एक हाथ से इस्तेमाल किया जा सकने वाला टेबलेट भी नहीं है । यह इंच चौड़ा है जो कि काफी ज्यादा है । लेकिन इससे इनकार नहीं किया जा सकता कि अतिरिक्त मोटाई इसके स्वरूप में काफी अंतर पैदा कर देती है जो आईपैड मिनी के पक्ष में नहीं है । आईपैड मिनी के बहुत पतले किनारे काफी मुश्किल पैदा कर देते हैं क्योंकि इस टेबलेट को बिना टचस्क्रीन एक्टिवेट किये पकड़ने के लिए बहुत कम जगह मिलता है । आईपैड मिनी शिक्षा के मामले में बच्चों के लिए काफी अच्छा टेबलेट है । बहुत सारे शैक्षिक किताबें एप्स और सामग्री के साथ एपल स्कूलों तक अपनी पहुंच बना रहा है और बहुत सारे टेबलेट्स एक साथ लेने के कारण उन्हें इसकी कीमत भी कम चुकानी पड़ती है । एपल आईपैड की कीमत $ है जो कि अमेज़न और गूगल के किंडल फायर एचडी और नेक्सस टेबलेट के $ कीमत से काफी ज्यादा है । पिक्सेल रेजोल्यूशन का पीएलएस एलसीडी डिस्प्ले है । एंड्रायड ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम है । जीबी स्टोरेज जिसे माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड से जीबी तक बढ़ाया जा सकता है । अच्छे परफॉरमेंस के बावजूद गैलेक्सी टैब प्लस की कीमत इसे पीछे कर देती है । हलांकि टैब में भी है लेकिन इस हिसाब से थोड़ी सी और कीमत में गैलेक्सी टैब ज्यादा बेहतर समझ में आता है । लेकिन परफॉरमेंस के लिहाज से गैलेक्सी टैब प्लस एक अच्छा पैकेज है । इसमें अच्छा परफॉरमेंस और क्षमता होने के साथ इसकी बैटरी लाइफ अन्य टेबलेट्स की तुलना में बहुत अच्छी है । इसकी बनावट और डिज़ाइन भी संतोषजनक है । इसमें कमी यह कि इस टेबलेट में पूरी तरह प्लास्टिक का इस्तेमाल हुआ है । इसके डिस्प्ले का रेजोल्यूशन कम और यह थोड़ा रिफ्लेक्टिव भी है । हमारी सलाह यह है कि इसे खरीदने का निर्णय करते समय आप इससे थोड़े से महंगे गैलेक्सी टैब को भी अवश्य ध्यान में रखें । यह विंडोज में अपग्रेड हो सकता है इस टेबलेट में की एचडी डिस्प्ले है इसके साथ ही यह क्वाड कोर इंटेल एटम प्रोसेसर पर काम करता है । इसके साथ ही इस टेबलेट में आपको मेगापिक्सेल का रियर और फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा मिल रहा है । इसके अलावा यह इंटरनल स्टोरेज के साथ उपलब्ध होगा और इसे आप तक एक्सपैंड भी कर सकते हैं । इसके कनेक्टिविटी ऑप्शन्स में डोंगल के द्वारा वाई फाई / / ब्लूटूथ माइक्रो एचडीएमआई और माइक्रोयूएसबी है । इसके साथ ही आपको इसमें एक क्षमता की बैटरी भी मिल रही है । अपनी कीमत की वजह से यह टेबलेट बड़ी उंचाइयां छूने वाला है और कुछ नया तो जरुर करने वाला है । इस साल आईबॉल को भारत का सबसे बढ़िया टेबलेट ब्रांड चुना गया था । आईबॉल ने अपने कम कीमत के विंडोज स्लाइड से पहले भी एक विंडोज टेबलेट लॉन्च किया था जिसकी कीमत थी । यह हाइब्रिड टेबलेट मैग्नेटिक पोगो पिन कीबोर्ड के साथ आया था जिसमें एक समेकित टचपैड भी था । डिजिफलीप प्रो टैबलेट्स एंड्रॉयड की गुणवता और इन्टेल प्रोसेसर का प्रदर्शन तीन स्क्रीन आकारों और उचित मूल्यों पर लाये हैं प्रवेश स्तर का ये इंच का मॉडल पिक्सेल आईपीएस डिस्प्ले और अच्छे दृश्य कोणों के साथ उचित कीमत पर उपलब्ध है । यह टैबलेट एंड्रॉयड के साथ आता है इस टेबलेट में कोई सिमकार्ड स्लॉट नहीं है पर यह कनेक्टिविटी के दवारा दे सकता है डिजिफलीप प्रो का डिजाइन उच्च कोटि का है । डिजिफलीप प्रो और इंच डिस्प्ले के साथ आता है । इसकी स्क्रीन अभूतपूर्व रंग और अच्छे दृश्य कोण देती है । डिजिफलीप प्रो का धातु फ्रेम इसे मजबूती देता है । यहाँ आप टेबलेट के दायीं तरफ़ पॉवर और वॉल्यूम के बटन देख सकते हैं इसके तिरछे किनारे न केवल देखने में अच्छे लगते हैं बल्कि लम्बे इस्तेमाल के दौरान आपकी उंगलियों में धसेंगे भी नहीं इसके पिछली तरफ टेबलेट का रियर कैमरा है जो जरूरत पड़ने पर आपके स्मार्टफोन कैमरा का अच्छा विकल्प है । पॉवर और वॉल्यूम बटन के नीचे इस टेबलेट का माइक्रो और माइक्रो सिमकार्ड स्लॉट है । यह टेबलेट कनेक्टिविटी देता हैं और इससे वौइस् कालिंग भी कर सकते हैं । डिजिफलीप प्रो रेसोलुशन और एक बड़े इंच आईपीएस डिस्प्ले के साथ आता है । इसके आगे की तरफ वीडियो चैटिंग इत्यादि के लिए फ्रंट कैमरा है । यह टेबलेट ग्लास और धातु डिजाईन के साथ आता है जोकि इसे मजबूती और आकर्षक बनाते हैं । अगर आप यू ट्यूब पर कोई वीडियो देख रहे है या कोई गेम खेल रहे है तो इसके किनारों पर लगे स्पीकर बेहतर साउंड क्वालिटी देते है । टैबलेट पर लगी स्पीकर ग्रिल इसकी खूबसूरती में और इजाफा करती है । यह टैबलेट बैटरी के साथ आता है जो आसानी से और सामान्य प्रयोग पर आधे से एक दिन तक चल सकता है । डिजिफलीप प्रो की तरह डिजिफलीप प्रो के दाए किनारे पर वॉल्यूम और पॉवर बटन के नीचे एक माइक्रो कार्ड स्लॉट और एक माइक्रो सिम कार्ड स्लॉट की सुविधा है । एचपी स्लेटबुक की कीमत रूपये है और इस कीमत पर बाज़ार में आपको बहुत से हाई एंड टेबलेट्स मिल जायेंगे । निश्चित रूप से एचपी स्लेटबुक की खास बात इसमें लगा अत्यधिक शक्तिशाली टेगरा चिपसेट है खासकर अगर आप टेबलेट पर गेम खेलने वालों में से हैं । हम आपको सलाह देंगे कि अगर आपको हर मामले में बेहतर परफॉरमेंस देने वाला टेबलेट चाहिए तो आपको ज्यादा परखे हुए आईपैड या सैमसंग गैलेक्सी नोट पर ध्यान देना चाहिए । एचपी स्लेटबुक में का डिस्प्ले है और इसमें सामने कोई फिजिकल बटन नहीं है । इस टेबलेट में नीचे की तरफ ज़रूरी पोर्ट और कनेक्टर हैं । दाहिनी तरफ है डफ़ोन्स जैक और बायीं तरफ माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड स्लॉट है । इस टेबलेट में सामने की तरफ नीचे दो स्पीकर्स हैं । इस टेबलेट के पीछे का हिस्सा एचपी लोगो के साथ सफ़ेद फिनिश में है । इसके पीछे के हिस्से में स्क्रैच आसानी से लग सकते हैं । इस टेबलेट में पीछे बिना फ़्लैश के कैमरे के साथ पॉवर बटन और वॉल्यूम रॉकर हैं । ये बटन इसके पिछले हिस्से में बहुत अच्छी तरह से लगे हुए है । कुल मिलाकर एचपी स्लेटबुक की बनावट काफी अच्छी है लेकिन यह अन्य टेबलेट्स की तुलना में भारी है । हमने एचपी स्लेटबुक में टेगरा चिपसेट होने के कारण बहुत अच्छे परफॉरमेंस की उम्मीद की थी और हमें ख़ुशी है कि यह हमारी उम्मीदों पर बिल्कुल खरा साबित हुआ । यह टेबलेट बेंचमार्क स्कोर के मामले में अब तक का सबसे तेज़ डिवाइस साबित हुआ । जबकि हमने इसके मुकाबले में गीगाहर्ट्ज़ क्वालकॉम स्नैपड्रैगन क्वाड कोर प्रोसेसर वाले सोनी एक्सपीरिया जेड अल्ट्रा को रखा था । इस टेबलेट के टचस्क्रीन का रिस्पोंस बहुत स्मूद और अच्छा है । इसका ऑन स्क्रीन कीबोर्ड टाइप करने में काफी आरामदेह है । इसके डिस्प्ले का रेजोल्यूशन पिक्सेल है जो इसे पीपीआई का पिक्सेल डेंसिटी देता है । लेकिन इसमें कमी यह हैं कि इसका डिस्प्ले ज्यादा ब्राइट नहीं है । इस टेबलेट पर एचडी वीडियो फाइल्स और गेम्स बहुत आसानी से चलते हैं लेकिन इसके स्पीकर की आवाज़ धीमी है । एचपी स्लेटबुक की कीमत में आपको बहुत से उच्च स्तर के टेबलेट्स मिल जायेंगे । निश्चित रूप से इस टेबलेट की खास बात इसका टेगरा चिपसेट है जो इस टेबलेट को बेहद शक्तिशाली बनाता है । अगर आपको टेबलेट पर गेम चलाना पसंद है तो यह डिवाइस आपको बिल्कुल निराश नहीं करेगा । टचस्क्रीन डिस्प्ले में रिजॉल्यूशन के साथ एक आइपीएस पैनल है और इसकी क्वालिटी भी अच्छी है । डिवाइस के अनुसार डिस्प्ले की व्यूइंग एंगल और ब्राइटनेस अच्छी और प्रभावित करने वाली है । पर टॉप का प्रोटेक्टिव ग्लास पैनल एक फिंगरप्रिंट मैग्नेट है । टैबलेट की पूरी बॉडी मेटल फिनिश के साथ प्लास्टिक की बनी है और यह बहुत प्रीमियम भी नहीं दिखता है । चिकलेट की लेआउट के साथ इसका की बोर्ड उपयोग करने में बेहद आसान है । टचपैड बेहद स्मूथ है हालांकि इसे और बेहतर बनाया जा सकता था । की बोर्ड डॉक टैबलेट के पीछे तक फैला हुआ है और टैबलेट केस की तरह टैबलेट को कवर करते हुए मोडा जा सकता है । टैबलेट को खड़ा करने के लिए इसे किकस्टैंड की तरह भी उपयोग किया जा सकता है जो देखने और उपयोग करने दोनों में अच्छा है । रेगुलर डॉक्यूमेंट एडिटिंग इंटरनेट ब्राउजिंग और आपके पसंदीदा टीवी सिरीज या मूवीज के लिए नोशन इंक केन से अच्छा विकल्प शायद आपको न मिले । कुल मिलाकर अपने फीचर्स और बनावट के साथ टैबलेट बहुत अधिक आकर्षक नहीं लगता लेकिन यह आपके काम के लिए पूरी तरह उपयोगी साबित होता है । फुल साइज का एक यूएसबी पोर्ट और मिनी एचडीएमआई का होना इसे और भी ज्यादा प्रोडक्टिव बना देता है । हमारी राय में नोशन इंक केन आपके खर्च किए पैसों के साथ पूरा न्याय करता है । साफ शब्दों में इसे पैसा वसूल प्रोडक्ट कहना सही होगा । ओवरऑल डिजाइन और कंस्ट्रक्शन में कुछ कमियां नजर आती हैं लेकिन उसकी कमी को हार्डवेयर पूरा कर देता है । पिक्सेल रेजोल्यूशन का आईपीएस एलसीडी डिस्प्ले है । गीगाहर्ट्ज़ इंटेल एटम सिंगल कोर प्रोसेसर हाइपर थ्रेडिंग के साथ । जीबी स्टोरेज जिसे माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड से जीबी तक बढ़ाया जा सकता है । मेगापिक्सेल रियर कैमरा वीडियो रिकार्डिंग के साथ है । आसुस फोनपैड सैमसंग गैलेक्सी टैब का सीधा प्रतियोगी टेबलेट है । इस टेबलेट में कुछ बहुत अच्छे फीचर्स हैं जैसे फ्लोटिंग एप्स अच्छी वीडियो प्लेबैक क्षमता कॉल क्षमता और शानदार बनावट । इसमें कमी यह है कि इसके परफॉरमेंस में कुछ देरी होती है और इसका रियर कैमरा अच्छा नहीं है । इसका जीबी आतंरिक स्टोरेज भी ज्यादा नहीं है । अगर आप रूपये के आस पास का टेबलेट खरीदना चाहते हैं तो आप निश्चित रूप से आसुस फोनपैड के साथ गैलेक्सी टैब पर भी विचार कर सकते हैं । आसुस फोनपैड को देखने पर यह एक सामान्य एंड्रायड टेबलेट लगता है । इस टेबलेट में नीचे की तरफ माइक्रो यूएसबी पोर्ट और है डफ़ोन्स जैक हैं । आसुस फोनपैड में हाइपर थ्रेडिंग के साथ गीगाहर्ट्ज़ इंटेल एटम सिंगल कोर प्रोसेसर है । यह टेबलेट एंड्रायड जेली बीन ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम पर काम करता है और इसमें आसुस का अपना कस्टम लांचर है । आसुस फोनपैड टेबलेट का सबसे नजदीकी प्रतियोगी सैमसंग गैलेक्सी टैब है । आसुस फोनपैड टेबलेट में सामने की तरफ कोई फिजिकल बटन नहीं है । इस टेबलेट में डिस्प्ले के ऊपर ईयरपीस और फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा है । नीचे की तरफ इसमें डफ़ोन्स जैक के साथ चार्जिंग है और डेटा ट्रान्सफर के लिए माइक्रो यूएसबी पोर्ट है । आसुस फोनपैड के पीछे मेगापिक्सेल का कैमरा है लेकिन इसमें फ़्लैश नहीं है । इसके पीछे का हिस्सा एल्यूमिनीयम का बना है जो इस डिवाइस को एक प्रीमियम फील देता है । फोनपैड से तुलना करने पर नेक्सस और सैमसंग गैलेक्सी टैब का पिछला हिस्सा प्लास्टिक फील देता है और चीप लगता है । फोनपैड के पीछे के हिस्से को खोला नहीं जा सकता इसका मतलब ये है कि आप बैटरी तक नहीं पहुंच सकते हैं । कुल मिलाकर आसुस फोनपैड का डिज़ाइन दूसरे टेबलेट्स की तुलना में काफी बेहतर है और यह एक काफी प्रीमियम डिवाइस नज़र आता है । हलांकि बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में आसुस फोनपैड का स्कोर इसके दूसरे प्रतिद्वंदियों की तुलना में बेहतर नहीं रहता है लेकिन इसका मतलब यह नहीं है कि इस टेबलेट का परफॉरमेंस ख़राब है । इसके स्पेसिफिकेशन को देखते हुए इसका परफॉरमेंस काफी अच्छा कहा जा सकता है । इस टेबलेट का टचस्क्रीन रिस्पोंस काफी अच्छा है और इसे इस्तेमाल करने में बहुत आराम रहता है । फोनपैड के के आईपीएस एलसीडी डिस्प्ले का रेजोल्यूशन पिक्सेल है जो पीपीआई का पिक्सेल डेंसिटी देता है । इसका डिस्प्ले काफी तीक्ष्ण है और इस पर देखने का एंगल भी काफी बढ़िया है । इस टेबलेट पर मूवी देखना गेम्स खेलना और मल्टीमीडिया चलाना एक काफी अच्छा अनुभव है । इस टेबलेट के स्पीकर की आवाज़ साधारण है । आसुस फोनपैड के कैमरे का परफॉरमेंस काफी निराशाजनक है । अच्छी रोशनी में भी फोटो स्पष्ट नहीं आते और नोइज़ी रहते हैं । कम रोशनी में इसके कैमरे का परफॉरमेंस और भी ख़राब रहता है । बैटरी लाइफ की बात करें तो हमारे लगातार वीडियो प्लेबैक टेस्ट में पूरे ब्राइटनेस लेवल और आवाज़ पर आसुस फोनपैड की बैटरी घंटे तक चलती है जो कि एक काफी शानदार बैटरी परफॉरमेंस है बै । इस टेबलेट में कुछ काफी अच्छे फीचर जैसे कि फ्लोटिंग एप्स अच्छी वीडियो प्लेबैक क्षमता कॉल करने की क्षमता और शानदार बनावट मौजूद हैं । इस टेबलेट में कमी की अगर बात करें तो इसका परफॉरमेंस कुछ धीमा रहता है और इसका रियर कैमरा बढ़िया नहीं है । इसका जीबी का इंटरनल स्टोरेज भी ज्यादा नहीं है । अगर आप लगभग रूपये कीमत का टेबलेट चाहते हैं तो आपको इसके साथ गैलेक्सी टैब पर भी विचार करना चाहिए । सैमसंग गैलेक्सी टैब के स्पेसिफिकेशन में टैब की तुलना में कोई बहुत ज्यादा सुधार नहीं हुआ है । कीमत के हिसाब से यह टेबलेट अच्छा परफॉर्म करता है लेकिन अगर आप भारी इस्तेमाल करने वाले हैं और इस पर भारी गेम्स चलाना या मल्टीटास्किंग करना चाहते है तो इस टेबलेट में आप कमी महसूस करेंगे । भारी इस्तेमाल के लिए नेक्सस बढ़िया है क्योंकि इस टेबलेट में अच्छा डिस्प्ले अधिक शक्ति और स्टॉक एंड्रायड इंटरफ़ेस है । अगर आप रूपये तक का टेबलेट खरीदना चाहते हैं तो आप इसके साथ नेक्सस आसुस फोनपैड जिंक क्वाड पर भी विचार कर सकते हैं । बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में गैलेक्सी टैब का स्कोर आसुस फोनपैड से थोडा बेहतर है लेकिन पहली पीढ़ी के नेक्सस से इसका स्कोर कम है । वास्तविक इस्तेमाल में इस टेबलेट का परफॉरमेंस अच्छा रहता है । इसका टचस्क्रीन काफी रिस्पोंसिव और अच्छा है । इस टेबलेट का इंटरफ़ेस भी काफी स्मूद और रिस्पोंसिव है वेब ब्राउज़िंग करना गेम्स खेलना आदि इस पर बहुत अच्छा अनुभव रहता है । गैलेक्सी टैब के के डिस्प्ले का रेजोल्यूशन पिक्सेल है जो इसे पीपीआई की पिक्सेल डेंसिटी देता है । इसका डिस्प्ले अच्छा है और इसका देखने का एंगल बढ़िया है । लेकिन ध्यान देने की बात ये है कि बाज़ार में डिस्प्ले वाले टेबलेट भी उपलब्ध हैं । हलांकि इसके डिस्प्ले से काम चल जाता है लेकिन हम इसमें और बेहतर रेजोल्यूशन चाहते थे । गेम्स की बात करें तो गैलेक्सी टैब पर सभी गेम्स चल जाते हैं । हलांकि भारी गेम्स में कभी कभी इसमें कुछ देरी और रुकावट देखने में आता है । इस टेबलेट की कॉल करने की क्षमता अच्छी है और इसकी आवाज़ की क्वालिटी भी बढ़िया है । गैलेक्सी टैब टेबलेट का मेगापिक्सेल का पीछे का कैमरा दिन के समय और अच्छी रोशनी में बहुत अच्छे फोटो देता है । लेकिन कम रोशनी में इसके कैमरे के परफॉरमेंस में काफी गिरावट आ जाती है । बैटरी लाइफ की बात करें तो गैलेक्सी टैब की बैटरी हमारे लगातार वीडियो प्लेबैक टेस्ट में लगभग घंटे तक चलती है । इसका मतलब यह है कि सामान्य स्थिति में एक बार चार्ज करने पर यह टेबलेट एक दिन से ज्यादा बहुत आराम से चल सकता है । सैमसंग गैलेक्सी टैब में टैब की तुलना में कोई खास अपग्रेड नहीं किया गया है । कीमत के हिसाब से इसका परफॉरमेंस अच्छा है लेकिन अगर आप भारी इस्तेमाल करने वाले हैं तो आपको इस टेबलेट में थोड़ी मुश्किल हो सकती है । भारी इस्तेमाल करने वालों के लिए नेक्सस एक बेहतर विकल्प है क्योंकि इस टेबलेट में बढ़िया डिस्प्ले और ज्यादा शक्ति है । इसमें सबसे बड़ा अंतर ये है कि नया नेक्सस पहले की तुलना में पतला और हल्का है । इसके डिस्प्ले के चारो तरफ के किनारे भी पहले की तुलना में कम कर दिए गए हैं । नया नेक्सस अब भी आसुस के द्वारा ही निर्मित किया जा रहा है और इसके स्पेसिफिकेशन में परिवर्तन काफी आकर्षक हैं । इसके इंच डिस्प्ले का रेजोल्यूशन पिक्सेल है जो इसे पीपीआई का पिक्सेल डेंसिटी देता है । यह डिवाइस जीबी और जीबी स्टोरेज के वर्ज़न में उपलब्ध है लेकिन इसमें इसके स्टोरेज को बढ़ाने का कोई विकल्प नहीं है । नेक्सस में अब मेगापिक्सेल का रियर कैमरा और मेगापिक्सेल का फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा है । नेक्सस में गीगाहर्ट्ज़ क्वालकॉम स्नैपड्रैगन प्रो क्रेट क्वाड कोर प्रोसेसर के साथ एड्रीनो जीपीयू और जीबी रैम है । नया नेक्सस लेटेस्ट एंड्रायड जेली बीन पर काम करता है । अगर आप गेमिंग पसंद करते हैं तो आपका भाग्य अच्छा है क्योंकि यह डिवाइस ओपनजीएल ईएस को सपोर्ट करता है । जीबी वाई फाई मॉडल की कीमत $ है जबकि जीबी वाई फाई मॉडल की कीमत $ है । अपने अन्य समकक्ष प्रतियोगियों की तुलना में नेक्सस का स्पेसिफिकेशन काफी बेहतर है । इसके हाई रेजोल्यूशन डिस्प्ले के कारण आप इस पर फुल एचडी वीडियो आसानी से देख सकते हैं । बताने की आवश्यकता नहीं है कि नेक्सस का स्टॉक एंड्रायड ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम दूसरे टेबलेट्स के एंड्रायड ओएस से काफी बेहतर है । इसका नहीं बढ़ाया जा सकने वाला स्टोरेज इसमें एक कमी है लेकिन यही नेक्सस का तरीका रहा है । हुवेई मीडियापैड लिंक की सलाह देना थोड़ा मुश्किल लगता है खास कर जबकि इसी कीमत पर बेहतर वैल्यू के साथ सैमसंग गैलेक्सी बाज़ार में उपलब्ध है । मीडियापैड लिंक की कीमत रूपये है और इसका लक्ष्य आईपैड मिनी आईपैड और सैमसंग गैलेक्सी टैब हैं । इसके स्पेसिफिकेशन अच्छे हैं और यह एंड्रायड जेली बीन ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम पर हुवेई कस्टम स्किन के साथ काम करता है । हुवेई मीडियापैड लिंक टेबलेट एमएम मोटाई के साथ काफी पतला है ग्राम वज़न के साथ यह तुलनात्मक रूप से हल्का भी है । इसके पीछे के हिस्से में बिना फ़्लैश का कैमरा है । इसके पीछे का हिस्सा खोला नहीं जा सकता इसलिए आप बैटरी तक नहीं पहुंच सकते । लेकिन इसकी बनावट काफी अच्छी है । मीडियापैड लिंक प्लास्टिक फिनिश और गोल किनारों के साथ है जिससे इसे पकड़ने में आराम रहता है । हुवेई मीडियापैड लिंक में दाहिनी तरफ पॉवर बटन और वॉल्यूम रॉकर हैं और बायीं तरफ है डफ़ोन्स जैक और माइक्रो यूएसबी पोर्ट हैं । इस डिवाइस के उपरी हिस्से में माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड स्लॉट और सिम कार्ड स्लॉट हैं । मीडियापैड लिंक टेबलेट में सामने की तरफ कोई फिजिकल बटन नहीं है इसमें सिर्फ फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा है । इसके पीछे के हिस्से में दो स्पीकर्स हैं जो बहुत सही स्थान पर लगाये गए हैं । यह टेबलेट पकड़ने और इस्तेमाल करने में काफी आरामदेह है । बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में यह सर्वोत्तम परफॉरमेंस देने वाला टेबलेट नहीं है । कुछ मामलों में यह नेक्सस से बेहतर परफॉर्म करता है और कुछ मामलों में यह गैलेक्सी नोट से भी बेहतर परफॉरमेंस देता है लेकिन कुल मिलाकर इसका परफॉरमेंस मध्यम स्तर का है । वास्तविक इस्तेमाल में मीडियापैड लिंक का परफॉरमेंस काफी अच्छा है । इस पर ब्राउज़िंग करना गेम्स खेलना और मूवी देखना काफी अच्छा अनुभव है । इसके टचस्क्रीन का रिस्पोंस काफी अच्छा है । इस टेबलेट में डेटा के लिए सिम कार्ड का इस्तेमाल हो सकता है लेकिन इससे कॉल नहीं किया जा सकता । बहुत सारे एप्स एक साथ चलाने पर भी हुवेई मीडियापैड लिंक का परफॉरमेंस मामूली धीमा होता है । कभी कभी एप्स लोड होने में ज़रूरत से ज्यादा समय लेते हैं लेकिन एक बार लोड हो जाने के बाद वे बहुत अच्छी तरह से चलते हैं । इस टेबलेट का डिस्प्ले अन्दर बहुत अच्छा काम करता है और इसका देखने का एंगल भी काफी ज्यादा है । मीडियापैड लिंक के स्पीकर्स की आवाज़ काफी तेज़ है । इसमें दो स्पीकर्स हैं जो इस टेबलेट के पीछे की तरफ लगे हुए हैं और इसमें अच्छी आवाज़ के लिए डॉल्बी डिजिटल प्लस फीचर दिया गया है । अगर आपको तेज़ और साफ़ आवाज़ वाला टेबलेट चाहिए तो यह डिवाइस आपके लिए है । हमारे लगातार वीडियो प्लेबैक टेस्ट में हुवेई मीडियापैड लिंक की बैटरी लगभग घंटे तक चलती है जो कि काफी अच्छा है । हुवेई मीडियापैड लिंक की कीमत रूपये है और इस कीमत पर इसे खरीदने की सलाह देना थोड़ा मुश्किल लगता है जबकि इसी कीमत पर बेहतर वैल्यू देने वाला सैमसंग गैलेक्सी नोट बाज़ार में उपलब्ध है । अगर आप का टेबलेट चाहते हैं तो जीबी वाई फाई आईपैड अब भी बाज़ार में उपलब्ध है । लेकिन जो बात मीडियापैड के पक्ष में जाती है वो है इसका बढ़िया डिस्प्ले अच्छी बैटरी लाइफ और इसमें दिए गए स्पीकर्स जिनकी आवाज़ काफी तेज़ है । इसमें कमी यह है कि इसका स्किन हर किसी को पसंद नहीं आ सकता है इसका कैमरा साधारण है और यह एंड्रायड जेली बीन ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम पर काम करता है । गैलेक्सी टैब एक शानदार डिवाइस है । इसकी कीमत बजट टेबलेट्स और आईपैड के बीच में है । इसके फीचर और स्पेसिफिकेशन आपके पैसों की पूरी कीमत देते हैं और यह कुल मिलाकर सोनी टेबलेट एस और मोटोरोला ज़ूम से बेहतर परफॉरमेंस देता है । इसमें सिर्फ एक ही कमी है कि इसके डिस्प्ले का रेजोल्यूशन थोड़ा कम है । सैमसंग गैलेक्सी टैब में का डिस्प्ले है । यह किसी भी बजट टेबलेट की तुलना में काफी बेहतर है लेकिन इसका आईपैड जैसा क्लासी फील नहीं है । टैब के पीछे का हिस्सा ग्रे प्लास्टिक मैट फिनिश में है जो कि काफी अच्छा है । यह इस डिवाइस को काफी अच्छा फिनिश देता है और इसके कारण यह उंगलियों के निशान और धूल से भी सुरक्षित रहता है । लेकिन इसका का डिस्प्ले चिकना है और इस पर उंगलियों के निशान आसानी से पड़ जाते हैं । सैमसंग गैलेक्सी टैब की मोटाई एमएम है और यह वास्तव में काफी पतला है । यह ग्राम वज़न के साथ काफी हल्का टेबलेट भी है । अपने आकार के वज़ह से यह डिवाइस इस्तेमाल करने में काफी आरामदेह रहता है । यह टेबलेट जीबी / जीबी / जीबी स्टोरेज क्षमता में आता है इसके मेमोरी को माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड से जीबी तक बढ़ाया जा सकता है । इस टेबलेट के बायीं तरफ माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड स्लॉट और सिम कार्ड स्लॉट हैं । इसके दाहिनी तरफ वॉल्यूम रॉकर और पॉवर बटन हैं । इसमें ऊपर की तरफ डफ़ोन्स जैक है और पीछे की तरफ बिना फ़्लैश का मेगापिक्सेल का कैमरा है । इस डिवाइस में सैमसंग ने बहुत सारे प्रीलोडेड एप्स दिए हैं । इसमें डिस्प्ले के नीचे तीन टच सेंसिटिव बटन बैक होम और टास्क मेनेजर दिए गए हैं । गैलेक्सी टैब में गीगाहर्ट्ज़ डुएल कोर प्रोसेसर है और जीबी रैम है । इसके स्क्रीन का रेजोल्यूशन पिक्सेल है । बहुत से अन्य टेबलेट्स में दिए गए पिक्सेल रेजोल्यूशन को देखते हुए टैब का रेजोल्यूशन थोड़ा निराशाजनक लगता है । इसका देखने का एंगल बहुत अच्छा नहीं है । इसका डिस्प्ले एक प्रीमियम डिवाइस की तरह काफी स्मूद और रिस्पोंसिव है । इसका डुएल कोर प्रोसेसर इस डिवाइस को अच्छे परफॉरमेंस और मल्टीटास्किंग के लिए सक्षम बनाता है । लेकिन बहुत ज्यादा एप्स बैकग्राउंड में चलाने पर इस डिवाइस का परफॉरमेंस कुछ धीमा हो जाता है । बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में गैलेक्सी टैब अन्य टेबलेट्स की तुलना में बहुत शानदार परफॉरमेंस देता है । लगभग सभी बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में इसका स्कोर अन्य टेबलेट्स की तुलना में बेहतर रहता है । ग्राफ़िक्स बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में भी यह दूसरे अन्य प्रतियोगियों को काफी पीछे छोड़ देता है । यह टेबलेट मूल रूप में एमओवी फाइल्स नहीं चला पाता जो कि निराशाजनक है । वीडियो फाइल्स इस पर बिना किसी परेशानी के बहुत अच्छी तरह चलते हैं । गैलेक्सी टैब में एक अच्छा फीचर यह है कि इसे आप एक फ़ोन की तरह इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं और इसमें आपको सिम कार्ड के साथ कनेक्टिविटी भी मिलती है । गैलेक्सी टैब में पीछे की तरफ बिना फ़्लैश का मेगापिक्सेल का कैमरा दिया गया है जबकि सामने वीडियो कॉल के लिए वीजीए कैमरा दिया गया है । इसका रियर कैमरा बहुत बेहतरीन तो नहीं है लेकिन अच्छी रोशनी में इससे अच्छे फोटो लिए जा सकते हैं । बैटरी लाइफ की अगर बात करें तो गैलेक्सी टैब की बैटरी सामान्य इस्तेमाल में वेब ब्राउज़िंग म्यूजिक मूवीज गेम्स और सोशल नेटवर्किंग आदि के इस्तेमाल के साथ डेढ़ दिन से ज्यादा आसानी से चल जाती है । लेकिन इसका कम रेजोल्यूशन इसकी एक कमी है जिसे और बेहतर होना चाहिए था । मेगापिक्सेल कैमरा एचडी वीडियो रिकार्डिंग के साथ । इसी कीमत पर आपको सोनी टेबलेट एस मिल सकता है । या फिर गैलेक्सी नोट जो कि अत्यधिक पोर्टेबल है । गैलेक्सी टैब प्लस की डिज़ाइन गैलेक्सी टैब और गैलेक्सी टैब से ली गई है जो कि स्पष्ट रूप से दिखाई देता है । हलांकि यह गैलेक्सी टैब से थोड़ा सा मोटा है लेकिन फिर भी यह काफी पतला टेबलेट है । इसके के डिस्प्ले के किनारे काला बेज़ेल है । इस टेबलेट के निचले हिस्से में चार्जिंग पोर्ट और दो स्पीकर्स हैं । बायीं तरफ सिम कार्ड स्लॉट और माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड स्लॉट हैं । ऊपर की तरफ एमएम है डफ़ोन्स जैक है । इस टेबलेट के दाहिने हिस्से में पॉवर बटन और वॉल्यूम रॉकर हैं । गैलेक्सी टैब प्लस के पीछे का हिस्सा इनेमल सफ़ेद फिनिश में है जो कि अच्छा है । इस पर चिकने फिनिश की तरह उंगलियों के निशान और स्क्रैच दिखाई नहीं देंगे । पीछे ही ऊपर के हिस्से में बायीं तरफ एलईडी फ़्लैश के साथ मेगापिक्सेल का कैमरा है । इस टेबलेट में प्लास्टिक का काफी इस्तेमाल हुआ है लेकिन इसकी बनावट की क्वालिटी अच्छी है । यह टेबलेट हल्का और पतला है और इस्तेमाल करने में काफी आरामदेह है । हलांकि टैब प्लस में रंग गैलेक्सी नोट के सुपर एमोलेड डिस्प्ले की तरह तीक्ष्ण नहीं हैं लेकिन इसका डिस्प्ले बुरा भी नहीं है । टैब प्लस के डिस्प्ले का कम रेजोल्यूशन इसमें एक कमी है । जिसकी वजह से इस पर वीडियो देखना उतना अच्छा अनुभव नहीं रहता खास कर जब आप एचडी वीडियो देख रहे हों । लेकिन इसमें अच्छी बात ये है कि इसके डिस्प्ले पर टेक्स्ट बहुत क्रिस्प आते हैं और इस पर पढ़ने में अच्छा रहता है । इस टेबलेट के डिस्प्ले का देखने का एंगल अधिक ब्राइटनेस पर तो ठीक रहता है लेकिन कम ब्राइटनेस लेवल पर यह अच्छा नहीं रहता । गैलेक्सी टैब प्लस के बैटरी की बात करें तो इसकी बैटरी लाइफ अन्य टेबलेट्स की तुलना में काफी अच्छी है । सामान्य इस्तेमाल में इसकी बैटरी वाई फाई के साथ वेब ब्राउज़िंग वीडियो म्यूजिक गेम्स और सोशल नेटवर्किंग आदि के इस्तेमाल के साथ लगभग दिन तक चल जाती है जो कि एक काफी अच्छा बैटरी परफॉरमेंस है । इसके डिस्प्ले का रेजोल्यूशन कम है और यह थोड़ा रिफ्लेक्टिव भी है । हमारी सलाह यह है कि इसे खरीदने का निर्णय करते समय आप इससे थोड़े से महंगे गैलेक्सी टैब को भी अवश्य ध्यान में रखें । एपल आईपैड एक खूबसूरती से डिज़ाइन किया हुआ और आसानी से इस्तेमाल किया जा सकने वाला डिवाइस है । आईपैड अपने पहले के आईपैड की तुलना में थोड़ा पतला और हल्का है लेकिन इसमें वही डिस्प्ले और रेजोल्यूशन है । आईपैड में बेहतर हार्डवेयर हैं और इस पर मूवी चलाना और उसे एडिट करना संभव है । आईपैड का डिस्प्ले पहले के आईपैड की तुलना में शार्प है यह अंतर एलसीडी और उपरी ग्लास के बीच कम जगह होने के कारण है । आईपैड में दो कैमरे हैं फेसटाइम के लिए फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा और एचडी वीडियो रिकॉर्डिंग के लिए रियर कैमरा । हलांकि इसके रियर कैमरे से बहुत अच्छे और स्पष्ट फोटो नहीं आते । आईपैड का कीपैड अच्छा है और इस पर टाइप करने में किसी तरह की परेशानी नहीं होती । हमने इसके एचडीएमआई एक्सेसरी को इस्तेमाल करने की कोशिश की लेकिन इसकी वीडियो क्वालिटी निराशाजनक रही । आईपैड अच्छी तरह से अपस्केल नहीं कर पाया और वीडियो क्वालिटी अच्छी और स्पष्ट नहीं रही जैसा कि होना चाहिए । परफॉरमेंस की बात करें तो आईपैड कोई भी एप्स या गेम्स चलाने पर धीमा नहीं होता । इस पर म्यूजिक चलाने पर यह पहले के आईपैड की तुलना में थोड़ा कम वार्म महसूस होता है । इसके स्पीकर की आवाज़ पहले से ज्यादा तेज़ है इसकी बैटरी लाइफ काफी अच्छी है और यह लगभग पहले के आईपैड के बराबर है । आईपैड एक शानदार प्रोडक्ट है लेकिन यह पहले वाले आईपैड के जितना क्रांतिकारी नहीं है । हार्डवेयर में परवर्तन और थोड़े बहुत इसके लुक में परिवर्तन के अलावा इसमें कोई खास बदलाव नहीं किये गए है । पिक्चर और विडियो थोड़े सुस्त और गैर दिलचस्प दिखते हैं । सैमसंग गैलेक् टैब नियो के फीचरों पर

आंतरिक स्टोरेज है । इस कीमत में वर्तमान में कुछ दूसरे टैबलेट जैसे मिलाग्रो टैब टॉप एचसीएल माई एजू टैब बीएसएनएल का पेंटा आदि है । हालांकि फनबुक प्रो इनकी तुलना में बेहतर स्पेशीफिकेशन हैं लेकिन ऐसे कम कीमत वाले टैबलेट्स की वास्तविक विश्वव्यापी परफार्मेंस हमेशा सवालों के घेरे में रहती है । चूंकि यह इंची टैबलेट है यह दिखने में बड़ा दिखता है लेकिन आयताकार आकार का धन्यवाद जिससे यह पकड़ने में काफी आसान है । इसको इस तरह बनाया गया है कि आप इसे बड़े आरामदाक तरीके से अपने हाथ में पकड़ सकते हैं । पीछे के पेनल को चारों कोनों से खरोंच युक्त किया गया है जिससे इस पर आगे की पकड़ मिलती है जबकि मैटे फिनिश मजबूत पकड़ को सुनिश्चित करती है । हालांकि कंपनी के द्वारा इसके वजन का खुलासा नहीं किया गया है फनबुक प्रो फिर भी हाथों में थोड़ा सा भारी महसूस होता है लेकिन यह इंची टैबलेट के हिसाब से सही है । बड़े आकार का मतलब है कि यदि आप कुछ टाइपिंग करना चाहते हो तो इसको आपको दोनों हाथों में लेना होगा । बॉडी पर वापस आते हैं इसमें चमकीली फिनिश डिसप्ले है जिसका मतलब है कि इसमें फिंगरप्रिंग के काफी निशान पड़ेंगे तथा आप डिवाइस को साफ देखना चाहते है तो आपको लगातार इसे साफ करने की जरूरत होगी । यदि आपके हाथ पसीने से तर है तब आपको अतिरिक्त सावधानी बरतने की जरूरत है । लेकिन इसमें खरोंचरोधी परत है जो कि किनारे से किनारे पर है टैबलेट को चमक तथा साफ फिनिश देती है । माइक्रोमैक्स हालांकि कीज के प्लेसमेंट के मामले में थोड़ा इनोवेटिव हो सकता था । पावर की को इस तरह से रखा गया है कि आपको इसका पता करने के लिए कुछ समय के लिए थोड़ी कड़ी मेहनत करनी होगी । यद्यपि बाद में आप इसके अभ्यस्त हो सकते हैं । आपको पावर और रीटर्न की को काम में लाने के लिए इन्हें थोड़ा ज्यादा प्रेस करना होता है । साथ ही चूकि सभी पोर्ट्स एक ही तरफ हैं तो आपको एक बार में सब कुछ कनेक्ट करने में मुश्किल हो सकती है । पीछे की ओर दो स्पीकर्स लगे हैं लेकिन आश्चर्यजनक रूप से आगे की ओर कोई भी नहीं है । यह गाने या विडियो को सुनने में कठिन बनाता है । कुल मिलाकर माइक्रोमैक्स फनबुक प्रो बनावट और स्टाइल के मामले में बेहतरीन लुक वाला टैबलेट है । हालांकि स्टाइल के मामले में यह औसत से अधिक डिवाइस है । जब इसके स्पेशीफिकेशन पर आते है फनबुक प्रो वास्वत में आंखों को लुभाने वाला है । इसमें गीगाहर्ट्ज कोर्टेक्स प्रोसेसर डुअल माली जीपीयू तथा नवीनतम आइस क्रीम सैंडविच ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम है । यह संयोजन टैबलेट की मजबूती को बयां करता है । टैबलेट एप्लीकेशन को बंद करने और खोलने में काफी तेज है । यूजर इंटरफेस आईसीएस यूआई के सामान्य यूजर इंटरफेस की तरह ही और यह काफी यूजर फ्रेंडली है । टैबलेट आपको आखिर में बंद किए एप्प्स को दिखाता है इसलिए आप बिना मेनु में गए उस अंतिम चीज पर आसानी से जा सकते हैं जहां आप काम कर रहे थे । आईसीएस इसे सेटिंग्स में बदलाव के लिए भी आसान बनाता है । अब प्रोसेसर पर आते हैं इस टैबलेट के साथ ही एप्प्स बल्कि गेम खेलना भी काफी आसान है । हमने इस पर कुछ है वी ग्राफिक्स वाले गेम खेले लेकिन टैबलेट ने कोई परेशानी नहीं दिखाई । लेकिन हां यह काफी जल्द गर्म हो जाता है उस समय भी जब आप कोई सरल एप्प्लीकेशन कम समय के लिए खोलते हैं । इसके अलावा इस टैबलेट पर गेम्स खेलना और मूवी देखना काफी आनंददायक है । टैबलेट जिसको पूरे दिन के लिए साथ ले जाने की संभावना होती है और इस दौरान चार्ज करने का कम ही मौका होता है इसलिए बैटरी की परफार्मेंस बहुत महत्वपूर्ण हो जाती है । हालांकि हम यह नहीं कहेंगे कि जब हम बैटरी लाइफ की बात करते है तब फनबुक प्रो बहुत ही खराब है लेकिन टैबलेट बहुत प्रभावशाली नहीं है । हम यह कह सकते है कि यह शानदार बैटरी लाइफ वाला औसत टैबलेट है । याद रहे कि फनबुक प्रो की बड़ी स्क्रीन के साथ आता है जो कि सही मायनों में शानदार है । लगभग प्रतिशत की चार्जिंग में हमने लगभग घंटे वाईफाई पर नेट सर्फिंग की जिसमें यूट्यूब पर विडियो देखना तथा मिनट तक गेम खेलना शामिल है । लेकिन उस समय तक फनबुक प्रो की बैटरी काफी कम हो गई थी तथा हमें उसे चार्जर से जोड़ना पड़ा । इसका मतलब है कि फुल रिचार्ज के साथ भी काफी सावधान होना पड़ेगा तथा चार्जर को रखना आवश्यक है । टैबलेट पहले से ही लोड स्टॉक एंड्रॉयड कीबोर्ड के साथ आता है लेकिन वैसे भी आप गूगल प्ले स्टोर से दूसरे तरह के कीबोर्ड्स को भी डाउनलोड कर सकते हैं । हालांकि दिए जा रहे कीबोर्ड के साथ हमारा बहुत अच्छा अनुभव नहीं है । कीबोर्ड कैपेसिटिव स्क्रीन होने के बावजूद सामान्य दबाने पर जवाब नहीं देता है । दरअसल अधिकतर समय इसे कड़े तरीके से दबाना पड़ता है अक्सर एक शब्द टाइप करने के लिए एक या अधिक बार दबाना पड़ता है । जब पढ़ने पर आते हैं फनबुक प्रो एक औसत प्रोडक्ट दिखता है । यह सही है कि इसका इंची डिसप्ले ईबुक के दो पेजों को दिखाने के लिए पर्याप्त है और जब से टैबलेट पिंच टू जूम पर जबाव देने लगा है आप बेहतरीन तरीके से पढ़ने के लिए जूम इन और जूम आउट का इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं । हालांकि टैबलेट की स्क्रीन में एंटी ग्लैरिंग कोटिंग नहीं है जिसका मतलब है कि आप लाइट के नीचे नहीं पढ़ सकते हैं । जैसा कि मैंने पहले कहा था प्रोसेसर गेम खेलने तथा विडियो को पूरी तरह से सहज चलाने के काबिल नहीं है । हालांकि इसका स्क्रीन रेजोल्यूशन तथा साउंड आउटपुट मजेदार है । इसके डिसप्ले का का पिक्सल रेजोल्यूशन बढ़िया दिखता है लेकिन यह शानदार नहीं है जैसे कि इसकी स्क्रीन है । वॉल्यूम आउटपुट थोड़ा धीमा है और फ्रंट पेनल में स्पीकर न होने के कारण आवाज और म्युजिक का सुनना थोड़ा मुश्किल है । टैबलेट में जीबी की आंतरिक मेमोरी है आगे आप माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड जोड़ते हुए इसे जीबी तक बढ़ा सकते हैं जिसमें आप अपनी फाइलें मूवी म्युजिक पिक्चर आदि को स्टोर कर सकते हैं । इसमें एचडीएमआई आउट पुट है जिससे आप स्टोर की गई फिल्मों और पिक्चरों को अपनी टीवी पर देख सकते हैं । टैबलेट को एचडीएमआई केबिल की सहायता से अपनी टीवी से जोड़कर आप अपनी टीवी पर भी इंटरनेट सर्फ कर सकते हैं । दुखद है कि इसमें ब्लुटूथ कनेक्शन नहीं है । विशेषकर स्टोर में एप्पस मूवीज लाइक टीवी एंटरटेनमेंट गेम्स और एजुकेशन जैसे सेक्शन है । हालांकि इनमें से कोई भी अभी काम नहीं कर रहा है । फनबुक प्रो के कुछ सकरात्मक पहलू जिनमें माइक्रोमैक्स इसके साथ टाटा फोटान डोंगल को रुपये के कम शुल्क के साथ दे रहा है जिसमें आपको का मुफ्त डाटा पहले दो महीनों के लिए मिलेगा प्रत्येक महीने के लिए जीबी । वर्तमान में रुपये की कीमत में बहुत से टैबलेट उपलब्ध हैं । हालांकि उनमें से कोई भी इंची स्क्रीन का नहीं हैः बल्कि अधिकांश टैबलेट या तो इंची है या फिर इंची । यदि आप इंच से प्रभावित नहीं है तो यह अच्छा रहेगा कि आप इंच के फनबुक टैबलेट के साथ जाएं जिसमें लगभग समान स्पेशीफिकेशन है केवल स्क्रीन के आकार को छोड़कर । अन्यथा मिलाग्रो टैब टॉप बीएसएनएल टैबलेट और एचसीएल माई एजू टैबलेट्स इस सैंगमेंट में है लेकिन कोई भी फनबुक प्रो के स्पेशीफिकेशन के बराबर नहीं है । संक्षेप में माइक्रोमैक्स फनबुक प्रो अपने अधिकतर प्रतिस्पर्धियों की तुलना में बेहतरीन स्पेशीफिकेशन और परफार्मेंस के कारण शानदार टैबलेट है । इसके नकारात्मक पक्ष जैसे कि गर्म होने की समस्या रिफेलेक्टिव स्क्रीन धीमा साउंड आउटपुट तथा ब्लुटूथ का अभाव निश्चित रूप से परेशान करते है लेकिन इसकी बड़े डिसप्ले तेज प्रोसेसर नवीनतम ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम जैसी खूबियों के आगे यह कोई मायने नहीं रखता है । अच्छी गुणवत्ता की बनावट है । बेहतरीन बैटरी लाइफ है । परफार्मेंस के लिहाज से बेहतरीन कीमत है । एप्पलीकेशन खुलने में अधिक समय लेते हैं । फिजिकल वॉल्यूम का अभाव है । सभी एप्पलीकेशन को सपोर्ट नहीं है । इसकी कीमत आकर्षक रुपये रखी गई है और तब भी इसके स्पेशीफिकेशन शानदार है जिसमें पिक्सल रेजोल्यूशन वाली इंची प्वाइंट टच स्क्रीन की बैटरी मेगापिक्सल का सामने वाला कैमरा शामिल हैं लेकिन स्पेशीफिकेशन में इस कीमत वाली दूसरी टैबलेटों की तुलना में कोई खास फर्क नहीं है । टैबलेट का रंग सफेद है काले रंग के सामने वाले हिस्से में एक किनारे से दूसरे किनारे तक ग्लास लगा है । टैबलेट के बाई तरफ मिमी जैक एचडीएमआई मिनी यूएसवी माइक्रो एसडी तथा चार्जिंग साकेट के सभी पोर्टस लगे है । सामने वाला कैमरा डिवाइस के ऊपरी हिस्से में बीचो बीच से थोड़ा सा दाहिनी ओर लगा है ऊपरी बायें किनारे पर पावॅर विकल्प होम तथा वापस के लिए वास्तविक बटन लगे है पीछे का पैनल सपाट है तथा किनारों पर घुमावदार है । पोर्ट और बटनों की स्थिति अच्छी है पर इकलौती खामी वॉल्यूम रॉकर का न होना है क्योंकि इसके लिए आपको स्क्रीन के वाल्यूम बटन पर निर्भर होना होगा जिसका मतलब है कि वॉल्यूम को ट्वीक करने के लिए आपको स्क्रीन में देखना होगा । कुल मिलाकर फिट एवं फिनिश की गुणवत्ता के मामले में टैबलेट अच्छा अहसास देती है साथ में काम करने के मामले में भी । टैबलेट में एंड्रॉयड आइसक्रीम सैंडविच ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम लगा है जबकि यूजर इंटरफेस की ट्वीकिंग बहुत कम की गई है जबकि कार्बन ने कुछ अपने एप्स जैसे कार्बन ब्राउजर तथा कार्बन गेम्स इविवो संचालित डाल रखे हैं जो कि अच्छी तरह डिजाइन किये गए है तथा गेम जिन्हें आप मुफ्त में डाउनलोड कर सकते हैं के संदर्भ में अच्छे विकल्प उपलब्ध कराते है । कार्बन ने कुछ और एप्स जैसे नेक्सट जीटीवी इंजेनिक मार्केट एप्स के लिए भी दिये हैं जो विशिष्ट तो नहीं पर उपयोगी जरूर है । इसके अलावा भी आप कार्बन पुश मेल क् तथा कार्बन मेसेंजर क्लाइंट को डाउनलोड कर सकते हैं जो कि एक साल के लिए मुफ्त हैं । टैबलेट का कीबोर्ड काफी सीधा है अच्छी तरह से डिजाइन किया गया हैं तथा लैंडस्केप और पोर्टेट मोड दोनों में टाइप करने में आसान है । इसकी खामी केवल एक है कि इसमें भारतीय भषाओं के लिए सपोर्ट नहीं है जबकि सस्ती कैटेगरी की विशेषता वाले भारतीय निर्माता से हम कुछ ऐसी अपेक्षा कर रहे थे । टैबलेट का डिसप्ले रंग और गंभीरता के मामले में अच्छा है लेकिन रेजोल्यूशन काफी औसत है तथा इस कैटेगरी में दूसरों द्वारा दिए जा रहे से ज्यादा भिन्न नहीं है । पर जो आप खर्च कर रहे हैं उसकी तुलना में डिसप्ले खराब नहीं है । मूवी तथा फोटो देखने में मजा आता है । टच की संवेदशीलता अच्छी है तथा एक साथ बहुत सारे टच पर भी बिना किसी दिक्कत के ठीक काम करता है । गेम खेलने में आनन्दपूर्ण अनुभव होता है जिसक लिए अच्छी टच प्रतिक्रिया को धन्यवाद । टैबलेट में गीगाहर्टज का एक्सर्वस्ट प्रोसेसर लगा है जो कि परफार्मेंस के मामले में बहुत ज्यादा तेज अनुभव तो नहीं देता है पर ठीक काम करता है । गेम्स तथा एप्स खुलने में कुछ देर लग सकती है पर एक बार एप्प चलने लगता है तो यह सहज ढंग से चलता है । यहां तक कि गेम खेलना भी सहज है । हमने फ्रूट निंजा एग्री बर्ड तथा टर्बो प्लाई को परखा तथा वह सभी सहज ढंग से काम कर रहे थे । गाइरो सेंसर तथा ग्रैविटी सेंसर जैसे सेंसर अच्छा काम करते है तथा गेम खेलना आसान बनाते हैं । एक्सवर्स्ट प्रोसेसर होने के कारण यह टैबलेट गूगल प्ले के सभी एप्स को सपोर्ट नहीं करता है । हालांकि यह लगभग सभी लोकप्रिय एप्लीकेशनों को सपोर्ट करता है तथा लगभग सभी यूजरों के लिए यह एक मुद्दा नहीं होगा । टैबलेट का स्पीकर काफी तेज है तथा काफी हद तक स्पष्ट है जिसका मतलब है कि यह पूरी तरह स्पष्ट नहीं है पर यह हर तरह से अच्छा है । सपोर्ट के मामले में टैबलेट सभी महत्वपूर्ण ऑडियो तथा वीडियो मीडिया टाइप्स को सपोर्ट करता है । इसमें वीडियो चैटिंग के लिए केवल सामने वाला मेगापिक्सल रेजोल्यूशन का कैमरा लगा है । फोटोग्राफी ऐसी नहीं है जो आपको बहुत उपयोगी लगे । वैसे भी यह इस उद्देश्य के लिए लगा भी नहीं हैं । कैमरे में सीमित सेटिंग्स दी गई हैं जैसे समयांतराल सेटिंग आप शटर बटन दबाने के बाद क्लिक को विलंबित कर सकते हैं तथा ह्वाइट बैलेन्स में दो विकल्प दिए हैं । की बैटरी अच्छा बैक अप देती है तथा वाईफाई नेटवर्क पर बेव सर्फिंग के लिए दावा किए गए घंटों पर खरी उतरती है । हमने डोंगल के द्वारा पर इसका परीक्षण नहीं किया है तथा हमें शंका भी है कि यह इससे कम होगा । पर जबकि इस कैटेगरी की दूसरी टैबलेटें वाई फाई पर घंटे ही दे पाती हैं इसका परर्फोंमेंस उत्तम है । टैबलेट गुणवत्ता तथा परफार्मेंस के मामले में कीमत के मद्देनजर न्याय करती है । टैबलेट देखने में अच्छी हैं तथा परफार्म अच्छा करती है । हालांकि इसमें औसत कैमरा एप्प लांच करते समय धीमा परफार्मेंस या वास्तविक वॉल्यूम रॉकर जैसी खामियां है पर इसमें से कोई भी खाई इतनी गंभीर नहीं है । इसके साथ में इस टैबलेट की कीमत प्रवेश स्तर की है आप चुनने के लिए बहुत ज्यादा अच्छे विकल्प नहीं पाते है । कार्बन एक अच्छा स्थापित ब्रांड है तुलना में उन तमाम नये प्रवेशकों की जिनसे यह टैबलेट प्रतिस्पर्धा करती है साथ में इसके साथ अच्छी तरह से स्थापित सेल एंड सर्विस नेटवर्क जुड़ा है । अच्छी बनावट गुणवत्ता है । सिम कॉलिंग अच्छा काम करती है । बेहतरीन परफार्मेंस है । गर्म होने की समस्या है । बहुत औसत बैटरी लाइफ है । जीपीएस सपोर्ट नहीं है । इस टैबलेट में ब्लूटूथ और वाईफाई सपोर्ट के अतिरिक्त सिम कॉलिंग फंक्शन सहित सिम सपोर्ट भी मौजूद है । इस टैबलेट के अन्य फीचर हैं इंच का केपेसिटिव मल्टीटच स्क्रीन माली ग्राफिक प्रोसेसर और के साथ प्रोसेसर इंटरनल मेमोरी जिसे तक बढ़ाया जा सकता है । हालांकि इसमें सपोर्ट नहीं है । यह टैबलेट एंड्रॉयड आईसीएस पर आधारित है और इसकी कीमत रुपये है । फीचर और स्पेसिफिकेशन के आधार पर टैबलेट की कीमत ठीक है लेकिन क्या इसकी परफॉर्मेंस भी इसकी स्पेसिफिकेशन के मुताबिक ही है जानने के लिए आगे पढ़ें । टैबलेट अपने पूरी तरह से काले नान ग्लॉसी फिनिश लुक के साथ शानदार दिखती है । प्लास्टिक की क्वॉलिटी सही फिट और फिनिश के साथ बेहतरीन है । इसका डिजाइन आयातकार है जिसमें कोने हल्का सा घुमाव लिए हैं बैक पैनल भी कोनों से घुमाव लिए है लेकिन यह काफी हद तक फ्लैट हैं । टैबलेट में पीछे की ओर मेगापिक्सल का कैमरा है वहीं सामने ऊपर बाएं कोने में कैमरा है । सिम स्लॉट नीचे की ओर है जबकि बाकी पोर्ट्स जिनमें चार्जिंग स्लॉट माइक मिनी यूएसबी माइक्रो स्लॉट पोर्ट और जैक टैबलेट के बायें कोने में हैं । पावर और वॉल्यूम रॉकर टैबलेट के ऊपर बायें कोने में हैं । सभी पोर्ट्स और बटन्स एर्गोनॉमिकली स्थित हैं । टैबलेट का पूरा डिजाइन अच्छा देखता है और बढ़िया काम करता है बल्कि क्वॉलिटी के आधार पर तो यह अपनी कीमत से कहीं अच्छा है । लो कॉस्ट सेगमेंट में डिसप्ले अमूमन एक जैसा ही होता है । इसका डाइग्नली इंच नाप का केपेसिटिव डिसप्ले पाइंट टच सपोर्ट करता है और इसका रिजॉल्यूशन है । टच रिस्पांस बेहतर है और यहां तक की सही ब्राइटनेस जो बहुत उत्तम नहीं है के साथ डिसप्ले क्वॉलिटी भी संतोषजनक ही है । जिंक प्लस का का प्रोसेसर अच्छी स्पीड देता है हालांकि यह गरम होने के कारण तंग करता है जिससे की एप्पलीकेशन्स क्रैश हो सकती हैं । फिर भी लगता है कि यह समस्या तभी आती है जब आप टैबलेट पर नेटवर्क इस्तेमाल कर रहे हों । हालांकि वाईफाई नेटवर्क इस्तेमाल के दौरान यह समस्या नहीं आती कम से कम हमें तो नहीं आयी । सिम कॉलिंग बढ़िया तरह से काम करती है और इसमें भी गर्माने की समस्या नहीं हुई । टैबलेट के कान के नजदीक आसानी से पकड़े जा सकने की सुविधा के चलते आप बिना इससे हैडसेट के भी कॉल कर सकते हैं यद्यपि आप टैबलेट का कान से लगाए हुए हास्यास्पद लग सकते हैं । जब हम नेटवर्क पर नेट ब्राउज कर रहे थे तब इसकी गरम होने की समस्या सामने आई और यह बार बार ब्राउजर क्रैश होने के सात ही आधे घंटे में सामने आ गया । लेकिन चूंकि तभी दिल्ली में बारिश शुरू हो जाने से मौसम ठंडा हो गया तो ऐसा लगा कि टैबलेट भी आराम से चलने लगी । हालांकि इस तथ्य को ध्यान में रखते हुए की भारत में मौसम सामान्य तौर पर गरम ही रहता है यह एक बड़ी समस्या है । गरम होने की समस्या के अलावा टैबलेट सही स्पीड पर बढ़िया काम करती है गेम्स सरलता से खेल जा सकते हैं और एप्पलीकेशन्स तेजी से खुलती हैं । एक और समस्या यह है कि टैबलेट में नहीं है जो कि यह जानकर की ए जीपीएस चिप बहुत सस्ती है और इसमें सिम सपोर्ट मौजूद है । ए जीपीएस लग सकता था बहुत निराशा होती है । क्यूंकि यह टैबलेट सिम के सेल साइट का इस्तेमाल करती है इससे इस टैबलेट की लोकेशन अवेयरनेस किसी भी अन्य सिर्फ वाइफाइ वाली टैबलेट से अच्छा है । इस टैबलेट के साथ उम्दा नियोप्रीन पाउच मिलता है जो बहुत टिकाऊ है बिना माइक का हैडफोन स्क्रीन गार्ड और केबल और चार्जर मिलता है । इसमें काई केबल नहीं है । मेगापिक्सल का कैमरा बहुत काम का नहीं है लेकिन इस बात को ध्यान में रखते हुए कि ज्यादातर लो कॉस्ट टैबलेट्स में यह होता ही नहीं है यह एक अतिरिक्त लाभ ही है । कैमरा औसत ही है और सामान्य फोटोग्राफी के लिए बढ़िया है वो भी सही रोशनी में । फ्रंट कैमरा यूनिट वीडियो चैट के लिए बढ़िया है । टैबलेट में की बैटरी है जो उचित है । हालांकि वाइफाइ पर टैबलेट लगभग चार से पांच घंटे चलती है । के लगातार इस्तेमाल पर बैटरी लाइफ तीन से चार घंटे में ही चुक जाती है । एक दिन के इस्तेमाल का स्टैंड बाई टाइम उचित है । स्पेसिफिकेशन परफॉर्मेंस और कीमत सभी टैबलेट के पक्ष में जाते हैं लेकिन गरम होने की समस्या इस टैबलेट की पूरे लाभ पर पानी फेर देती है । सिर्फ वाइफाइ मोड में यह ठीक है लेकिन अगर आपको यह वाइफाइ मोड में ही इस्तेमाल करना हो तो इसकी कीमत ठीक नहीं है यहां तक की जिंक खुद इसी स्पेस जैसी सिर्फ वाइफाइ वाली टैबलेट्स को लगभग आधी कीमत पर बेच रहा है । उम्मीद है कि यह समस्या सिर्फ इसी पीस में हो अगर नहीं तो जिंक को अपने ब्रांड की इमेज लंबे समय तक बनाए रखने के लिए यह टैबलेट्स बेचना बंद कर देना चाहिए । कभी कभी सुस्त हो जाता है । हिंदी भाषा सपोर्ट में गलतियां हैं । ज्यादातर एप्पस काम के नहीं हैं । इसी तरह मिलाग्रो की ओर से एक अन्य टैबलेट टैबटॉप सामने आयाजा जिसके बारे में कंपनी का दावा है कि यह सबसे स्लिम और पावरफुल टैबलेट है । यह वाकई सबसे स्लिम टैबलेट है । टैबलेट वाकई काफी स्लिम है और इसकी सर्वाधिक मोटाई है । चारों ओर स्लिम बेजेल के साथ यह काफी कॉम्पैक्ट भी है । टैबलेट पर सिर्फ तीन फिजीकल की हैं । ये बेजेल के बायीं ओर सामने वाले कैमरा के साथ हैं । इस टैबलेट में कोई वॉल्यूम रॉकर नहीं है । इसका रियर पैनल अल्यूमिनियम फिनिश के साथ आता है । इसमें सिर्फ एक स्पीकर ग्रिल है और टॉप में ब्लैक डिजाइन एलीमेंट है । इसके एज शार्प हैं जबकि इसका सामने वाला हिस्सा पूरा ब्लैक है । कुल मिलाकर डिजाइन सरल लेकिन आकर्षक है । इसके पोर्ट्स जिसमें मिनी एचडीएमआई पोर्ट पावर सॉकेट एक माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड स्लॉट और एक जैक शामिल हैं दाहिनी ओर दिए गए हैं । सभी पोर्ट काफी व्यवस्थित दिखते हैं । फोनी की बनावट काफी अच्छी है और वास्तव में यह कम कीमत वाली श्रेणी में सर्वश्रेष्ठ है । आश्चर्यजनक तरीके से इसका पावर बटन अन्य बटनों को लॉक नहीं करता है । मिलाग्रो टैब एक सात इंच के कैपेसिटिव टच डिसप्ले के साथ आता है । इसमें फाइव प्वाइंट टच और आसपेक्ट रेशियो है । स्क्रीन में ओलियोफोबिक स्क्रीन गार्ड दिया गया है जो कि इसे फिंगर ऑयल मार्क से बचाता है । यह एक अच्छी खूबी है । स्क्रीन का रिजोल्यूशन है । यह रिजोल्यूशन अच्छा है और मार्केट में उपलब्ध अन्य विकल्पों की तरह है । स्क्रीन हालांकि बहुत ब्राइट नहीं है लेकिन यह अच्छी कलर रेंडेरिंग और शार्पनेस लेवल प्रदान करती है । हालांकि हमने पाया कि इसका टच कभी कभी भटक जाता है । इसलिए आप आस पास मौजूद दो की दबाते वक्त गलत की के दब जाने की गुंजाइश काफी अधिक रहती है । यह टैबलेट प्रोसेसर के साथ आता है और इसमें रैम और डुअल माली एमपी है । यह कंबीनेशन अधिकांश मौकों पर अच्छा काम करता है और यहां तक कि सीएडी फाइल भी अच्छे तरीके से प्ले करता है । यद्यपि यह कभी कभी धीमा हो जाता है लेकिन यह कभी काम करना बंद नहीं करता है । यह गेम्स और वीडियो को बिना किसी कठिनाई के प्ले करता है । दावे के अनुसार यह टैबलेट सेकेंड में बूटअप कर देता है । यह वाकई अच्छा है क्योंकि इसमें एंड्रॉयड फोन के साथ आने वाले सामान्य एप्पलीकेशंस की तुलना में अतिरिक्त एप्प्स हैं । यह टैबलेट प्री लोडेड एप्पलीकेशंस के साथ आता है । हालांकि इनमें से कई हर किसी के काम के नहीं होंगे लेकिन ये विशेष जरूरत वाले चुनिंदा लोगों मसलन डॉक्टर्स के लिए काफी उपयोगी होंगे । वास्तव में ये एप्पस ढूंढने में काफी मुश्किल हैं क्योंकि ये काफी लोकप्रिय नहीं हैं । इसमें एक भारतीय एंड्रॉयड मार्केट भी है इसमें खास भारत के लिए एप्लीकेशंस हैं जिन्हें डाउनलोड किया जा सकता है । कम्प्लीट गूगल प्ले स्टोर भी इस पर इन्सटॉल है और यह पूरी तरह एक्सेसिबल है । विशेष तौर पर अच्छी बात यह है कि इसमें डॉक्यूमेंट्स टू गो एप्प का फुल वर्जन उपलब्ध है । इसमें ई मेल पर बिना इंटरनेट एक्सेस के काम करने के लिए एक ऑफलाइनल ई मेल क्लाइंट भी प्री इन्सटॉल्ड है । इसमें पुश नोटिफिकेशन के साथ एक ऑनलाइन ई मेल क्लाइंट भी है । अन्य एप्प्स में के फ्री क्लाउड स्टोरेज के साथ ऑफिस ड्रॉप भी शामिल है । एप्प्स को पांच श्रेणियों प्रोडक्टिविटी नेटवर्किंग यूटिलिटी एंटरटेनमेंट और मेडिकल फोल्ड में विभाजित किया गया है । यह टैबलेट हिंदी सहित अन्य भाषाओं को भी सपोर्ट करता है और सबके लिए इसमें की बोर्ड है । हालांकि हमने जब अपने हिंदी साइट के लिए न्यूज एडिट करने की कोशिश की तो इसमें टेक्स्ट काफी उलझे हुए तरीके से दिखे । हो सकता यह समस्या इसमें इस्तेमाल किए गए फोंट की वजह से हो । कुल मिलाकर यह संतोषजनक नहीं था । इस टैबलेट में की बैटरी है जो कि इतने पतले टैबलेट के लिए बड़ा है । यह बैटरी इस डिवाइस को सामान्य इस्तेमाल की स्थिति में घंटे चलने में सक्षम बनाता है जो किसी टैबलेट के लिए अच्छा है । इस टैबलेट के अगले हिस्स में एक मेगापिक्सल कैमरा है । हालांकि इसमें कोई रियर कैमरा नहीं है । यह कैमरा डिजीटल जूम को सपोर्ट करता है । इसमें चौड़े एंगल की तस्वीरों के लिए सिंगल मोशन पैनोरमा मोड स्लो मोशन धीमी गति की वीडियोग्राफी के लिए टाइम लैप्स टाइम इंटरवल अलग अलग लाइट लेवल के लिए आठ एक्सपोजर लेवल एफपीएस व्हाइट बैलेंस सेटिंग ऑटो क्लाउडी इनकैनडिसेंट डेलाइट प्लूरोसेंट वीजीए और क्यूवीजीए ऑप्शन वीडियो रिकॉर्डिंग के समय स्नैपशॉट भी मौजूद है । ये सभी फीचर्स काम कर रहे थे और कैमरा इंटरफेस भी इस्तेमाल करने में काफी आसान है । हालांकि महज मेगापिक्सल कैमरा होने की वजह से हम बहुत उम्दा परिणाम की उम्मीद नहीं कर रहे थे और इसका परफॉर्मेंस उम्मीद के मुताबिक ही रहा । मतलब यह हुआ कि यह कैमरा काम करता है और कभी कभीर फोटोग्राफ लेने और वीडियो चैट के लिए काफी उपयोगी है । पिक्चर को क्रॉप और रोटेट करने के साथ शेयरिंग और एडिटिंग लेवल सेट करना रेड आई को हटाना इफेक्ट डालना और भी बहुत कुछ आसान है । कम कीमत वाले टैबलेट में सामान्यतौर पर ऐसा नहीं होता है । एक अन्य महत्वपूर्ण फीचर इसका और एक्सटर्नल डोंगल के साथ कॉम्पैटिबल होना है । यह टैबलेट तक के एक्टर्नल हार्ड डिस्क ड्राइव को भी सपोर्ट करता है । इसे इस्तेमाल करने के लिए कंपनी यूएसबी मिनी से फुल यूएसबी मिनी कनवर्टन भी इसके साथ दिया है । इससे यह केबल एक ही समय में टैबलेट को चार्ज करने के साथ साथ एक्सटर्नल हार्ड ड्राइव को भी ऊर्जा दे सकता है । लेकिन इसे आप अपने फोन को चार्ज करने में इस्तेमाल नहीं कर सकते हैं क्योंकि वे माइक्रो यूएसबी पोर्ट के साथ आते हैं । यह टैबलेट डुअल डिसप्ले टेक्नोलॉजी के साथ एक एचडीएमआई पोर्ट के साथ आता है । इसका मतलब हुआ कि टैबलेट का स्क्रीन टीवी वाले इमेज को डिसप्ले करेगा । इस दौरान टैबलेट का स्क्रीन पूरी तरह से फंक्शनल होगा । यह गेम्स खेलते वक्त काफी काम आता है । इस कीमत पर यह टैबलेट वाकई पैसा वसूल है । इसमें कुछ कमियां भी हैं लेकिन इसमें से कोई भी इतनी बड़ी नहीं है कि खरीदने के फैसले को बदल सके । यह एक ठीक ठाक टैबलेट है और कुछ नहीं । इस बात से सहमत हुआ जा सकता है कि इसमें एक्सटर्नल ड्राइव के लिए सपोर्ट जैसे कुछ खास फीचर्स हैं लेकिन ये इतने भी अच्छे नहीं हैं जो इसे अन्य टैबलेट से बहुत अलग बनाता हो । यह टैबलेट बड़े ब्रांड जैसे सैमसंग आदि को पीछे नहीं छोड़ता है । लेकिन ऑवरऑल पैकेज के तौर पर यह बजट रेंज में वाकई अच्छा विकल्प है । सहज टच स्क्रीन खासियत है । प्रीलोडेड प्रीमियम गेम्स है । एचडी विडियो प्लेबैक है । शानदार बनावट की गुणवत्ता । अक्सर रुक जाना परेशान करता है । कम रेजोल्यूशन डिसप्ले है । ब्लुटूथ नहीं है । यह टैबलेट भी बहुत अच्छे फीचर एवं स्पेसीफिकेशन के साथ आता है । हालांकि कम कीमत वाली टैवलेटों की खराब परफार्मेंस के लिए प्रायः आलोचना की जाती है जबकि इनमें लगे कुछ फीचर ईर्ष्या पैदा करते है । पहली नजर में इंटेक्स आई टैब अपनी पूरी प्लास्टिक बॉडी के साथ ठीक लगता है । आई टैब की चौड़ाई मिमी मोटाई मिमी तथा ऊंचाई मिमी है । इसका वजन ग्राम इसके इंची डिसप्ले के मद्देनजर ठीक है । पर यह थोड़ा अजीब लगता है क्योंकि कम कीमत के ज्यादातर टैबलेट में इंची डिसप्ले लगा है । इसकी पूरी बॉडी प्लास्टिक की बनी है पर पीछे की मैट जैसी फिनिशिंग अच्छी लगती है । इसे पकड़ना आसान है । लेकिन इसके लुक का मुख्य मुद्दा इसका सामने का हिस्सा है । सामने की तरफ इसके इंची डिसप्ले के चारो ओर पतली क्रोम की पट्टी का घेरा है जिसके चारों ओर इंची उभरा हुआ प्लेटफार्म है । साथ में या के पहलू के अनुपात की जगह आई टैब में का अनुपात है जो इसे कुछ वर्गाकार बनाता है । आई टैब में बटन भी अपरंपरागत तरीके से लगाए गए है जिन्हें यूजर पसंद या नापसंद कर सकता है जो उसकी अपनी प्राथमिकताओं पर निर्भर करेगा । उदाहरण के लिए वालयूम रॉकर मीनू एवं रिटर्न बटन टैबलेट के सबसे ऊपरी हिस्से पर लगे है जबकि आप टैबलेट को लैडस्केप मोड में पकड़ते है । इसी तरह से पकड़ने पर आपको सारे पोर्ट यूएसबी टी एफ माइक्रो यूएसवी मिमी जैक चार्जिंग पोर्ट एचडीएमआई पोर्ट रिसेट बटन ऑन ऑफ बटन तथा एक छोटा माइक सभी दाहिने हाथ वाली साइड में मिलेंगे । अन्य सभी साइडों में कोई बटन नहीं लगे हैं । यह स्थापना कभी कभी समस्या पैदा करती है जैसे कुछ गेम जो केवल क्षैतिज मोड में खुलते है खेलते समय या विडियो देखते समय आप टैबलेट को लैंडस्केप मोड में पकड़ने के लिए बाध्य होते हैं जो कि माइक को ढक सकता है । यदि आपने अपना हेड सेट यूएसवी चार्जर या डोंगल लगा रखा है तो टैबलेट को पकड़ना आपके लिए बहुत असुविधाजनक होगा । का अनुपात भी कुछ हद तक माफिक नहीं है बशर्ते आप कोई मूवी देखना चाहते है जिसके लिए या का अनुपात सही लगता है । कुल मिलाकर टैबलेट देखने में मजबूत लगता है जबकि डिसप्ले के चारों ओर का उभरा हुआ प्लेटफार्म डिसप्ले पर किसी तरह का सक्रैच आने से रोकेगा तथा कुछ हद तक उसकी सुरक्षा भी करेगा । टैबलेट निश्चित रूप से देखने में भारी है तथा बटन गलत जगह लगे है पर इसकी टचस्क्रीन अच्छी गुणवत्ता की है तथा कमांड पर अच्छी प्रतिक्रिया देती है । इंटेक्स आई टैब का ध्यान देने योग्य फीचर इसका एक गीगाहटर्ज का कोर्टक्स प्रोसेसर है जो पहले सस्ते सेगमेंट में दुर्लभ चीज थे पर अब कुछ अन्य सस्ते टैबलेट में भी यह प्रोसेसर लगा है । आईटैब में एमबी की मेमोरी लगी है इसका यह प्रोसेसर और रैम का संयोजन इसे एंड्रायड आईसीएस अपग्रेड के लिए उपयुक्त बनाता है । दुःख की बात है कि फोन में एंड्रॉयड जिंजरब्रेड ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम का पुराना वर्जन एंड्रॉयड ही लगा है । जबकि इसका प्रोसेसर शक्तिशाली है तथा एप्पलीकेशन को बड़ी सरलता से चलाता है । ब्लड और गैलरी जैसे भारी ग्राफिक्स आधारित गेम्स भी हम इस पर खेल सकते है । भारी ग्राफिक्स वाले खेलों के लिए टैबलेट की प्रतिक्रिया धीमी हो सकती है लेकिन वास्तव में यह ऐसे गेम को खेलने में सक्षम है । सहज टच तथा साफ आवाज गेम खेलना और अच्छा बनाते है । हालांकि कभी कभी टैबलेट क्रैश कर जाता है जिससे कई बार इसे रिसेट करने के लिए बाध्य होना पड़ता है लेकिन कुल मिलाकर इसका परफार्मेंस ज्यादातर समय पर सहज था । इस टैबलेट की एक बेहतर बात यह है कि यह है कि यह बहुत सारे प्रीमियम गेम जैसे कट एंड रोप के साथ आता है । जब बात मूवी देखने की आती है तो टैबलेट को अच्छा पाते है । डिवाइस में यूएसवी पोर्ट लगा है जिसमें पेनड्राइव लगाकर आप अपनी मूवी का मजा ले सकते है । यूएसवी पोर्ट यूजर को डोंगल द्वारा इंटरनेट कनेक्शन की भी सुविधा देता है । लेकिन यदि आप के पास वाई फाई कनेक्शन नहीं है तो दुख की बात है कि इसमें ब्लूटुथ कनेक्टविटी नहीं है । इंटेक्स आई टैब में बड़ी की बैटरी लगी है जो उत्तम है । साधारण उपयोग में यह दिनभर चलती है । लेकिन जब आप गेम खेलते है तो बैटरी बड़ी तेजी से खत्म होती है । इसमें सामने की ओर मेगापिक्सल का एक कैमरा लगा है जो सस्ते डिवाइसों का एक नियम सा है । यह वीडियो चैट के लिए अच्छा काम करता है और यही इसका उद्देश्य भी है । क्योंकि यह एक वीजीए कैमरा है अतः फोटोग्राफी का सवाल ही नहीं उठता है । कुल मिलाकर इसके फीचर के मद्देनजर टैबलेट अच्छा है । जबकि बहुत से तथ्य इसके खिलाफ जाते हैं जैसे यह अप्रचलित एंड्रॉयड पर आधारित है ब्लूटुथ नहीं है सिम स्लॉट नहीं है पीछे की ओर कोई कैमरा नहीं है न ही देखने में बहुत अच्छा डिवाइस है । इस टैबलेट की एक और अच्छी बात यह है कि यह डाटा कार्ड एक एलएएन एडॉप्टर एक चमड़े का कवर तथा एक जोड़ा रीबॉक धूप के चश्मे के साथ ऑनलाइन विक्रेता के अनुसार आता है जो प्रभावी रूप से टैबलेट की कीमत लगभग रुपये के स्तर तक कम कर देते हैं । अच्छी स्क्रीन है । अच्छी परफार्मेंस है । गुड लुक्स हैं । बैटरी लाइफ अच्छी नहीं है । डिफ़ॉल्ट भाषा चीनी है । इसमें प्वाइंट टचस्क्रीन गीगाहर्टज का आर्म कार्टेक्स तथा मेगाबाइट का डीडी आर रैम लगे है । साथ में इसमें एक एचडीएमआई पोर्ट माइक्रो एसडी स्लॉट मिमी का आडियो आउट तथा डोंगल के लिए यूएसवी पोर्ट लगे हैं । वाम्मी की क्षमता पी पूर्ण एचडी वीडियो स्ट्रीमिंग की है तथा मेगाहर्ट्ज का समर्पित जीपीयू उन्नत फ्लैश एप्प इटरेक्टिव एप्प तथा पूर्ण एचडी वीडियो के लिए लगे हैं । स्पेसीफिकेशंस तो आकर्षक हैं लेकिन बाजार में इस तरह के स्पेसीफिकेशंस वाले अन्य टैबलेट भी हैं । और जब हमने इसे पहली बार देखा तो कीमत तथा परफार्मेंस को अच्छा पाया पर बाद में कुछ खामियां भी मिली । विक्डलीक वाम्मी बिल्कुल सफेद रंग में आता है लेकिन इसके किनारे अल्युमिनियम की तरह के बने है । इसके दो किनारे चौड़े वाले सामने की तरफ झुके हैं जिससे सामने की तरफ से बटन दिखाई पड़ते है जो इन बटनों के द्वारा नेवीगेशन को आसान बनाते है । पूरा यूएसवी पोर्ट छोटा यूएसवी पोर्ट एक चार्जिंग का पोर्ट एक मिमी का जैक एक एचडीएमआई पोर्ट तथा एक माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड का स्लॉट यह सभी पोर्ट टैबलेट के दाहिनी तरफ लगे हैं । इस तरह की स्थापना समस्या पैदा करती है जबकि आप कई कनेक्टर का उपयोग करना चाहते हैं तथा इसे बर्बाद कर देती है । हालांकि यूजर एक साथ दो से ज्यादा कनेक्टर का उपयोग नहीं करता है तथा एक तरफ सारे पोर्ट की स्थापना से उन तक पहुंच को आसान बनाता है । टैबलेट में पीछे की तरफ कैमरा नहीं लगा है लेकिन सामने की तरफ फ्रंट पैनेल की ऊपरी दाहिनी तरफ एक वीजीए कैमरा लगा है । पॉवर और वॉल्यूम रॉकर ऊपर दाहिने कोने पर लगे हैं तथा सामने से भी दिखायी देते है । टैबलेट की निर्माण की गुणवत्ता अच्छी नहीं है । यह जरा से दबाव में चर्र चर्र की आवाज करता है । इंची कैपेसिटिव टचस्क्रीन डिसप्ले की चमक अच्छी है तथा ठीक काम करने वाले प्वाइंट टच को सपोर्ट करता है । यह अन्दर लगे एक मल्टीटच एप्लीकेशन के द्वारा यह जांचने की सुविधा देता है कि टच कितना सही काम कर रहा है । हमने इस एप्प का प्रयोग किया तथा स्क्रीन ने सभी पांचों उंगलियों के टच पर अच्छी प्रतिक्रिया दी । स्क्रीन रेजोल्यूशन के साथ आती है जो इस कीमत वाली टैबलेट के लिए बेहतर लगती है । पिक्सल दिखाई पड़ते हैं पर ठीक है तथा डिसप्ले की गुणवत्ता को ज्यादा प्रभावित नहीं करते हैं । इमेज तथा वीडियो वास्तव में अच्छे आते है । रंग तथा तीखापन भी ठीक से डिसप्ले होते हैं । विक्डलीक वाम्मी में माली एकसीलरेटर ग्राफिक्स प्रोसेसर एवं एमवी रैम के साथ एडब्लू कार्टेक्स लगा है । अच्छा यह है कि आप अन्दरूनी रूप से लगे सीपीयू मास्टर एप्प के कारण प्रोसेसर को ओवर क्लॉक कर सकते हैं । एप्लीकेशन न केवल परफार्मेंस को अधिकतम करने की सुविधा देता है बल्कि स्पीड को नियंत्रित करने की भी सुविधा देता है ताकि बैटरी लाइफ को बढ़ाया जा सके । साथ में एक विकल्प भी है जिससे सिस्टम इस एप्प से प्रोसेसर को ओवर क्लॉक कर सकता है जो प्रयोग हो रहे एप्प की मांग पर आधारित होगा । और इस तरह से परफार्मेंस में सुधार हो जाता है तथा कुछ न कुछ बैटरी भी बचती है । कुल मिलाकर टैबलेट का परफार्मेंस संतोष जनक है हालांकि कभी कभी कुछ एप्प क्रैश भी कर गए तथा कभी कभी टैबलेट धीमा भी हो गया । किन्तु ज्यादातर समय टैबलेट ने बिना किसी फ्रेमिंग या धीमे हुए ही अच्छा काम किया है । कम कीमत का टैबलेट होने के मद्देनजर इसे टैबलेट के परफार्मेंस की रेटिंग अच्छी कही जा सकती है । विक्डलीक वाम्मी एंड्रॉयड के साथ आता है । तथा कुछ अतिरिक्त एप्लीकेशन के अलावा जिनकी चर्चा हम ऊपर के पैराग्राफ में कर चुके हैं ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम कुल मिलाकर स्टॉक संसकरण का ही है । हालांकि टैबलेट को फैक्ट्री रिसेट करने पर एक समस्या दिखाई पड़ती है । रिसेट करने के बाद यह चीनी भाषा में खुला जिससे इसे अंग्रेजी भाषा में रिस्टोर करना बहुत मुश्किल हो गया क्योंकि सभी निर्देश चीनी भाषा में थे और हकीकत में भाषा को कहां से बदला जाए यह जानने के लिए हमें दूसरे एंड्रॉयड टैबलेट का प्रयोग करना पड़ा । वास्तव में अंग्रेजी भाषा में रिस्टोर करने के बावजूद कीबोर्ड के कुछ बटन चीनी भाषा में ही दिखाते रहे । इस टैबलेट में केवल सामने की ओर एक वीजीए रेजोल्यूशन वाला कैमरा लगा है । यह कैमरा विडियो चैट के लिए ठीक है पर फोटोग्राफी के लिए ठीक नहीं है क्योंकि वीजीए कैमरा होने के कारण कम अच्छी तस्वीरें देता है । विक्डलीक टैबलेट फुल एचडीएमआई पोर्ट के साथ आता है जो दोहरा सक्रीन डिसप्ले सपोर्ट करने में सक्षम है । इसमें एक फुल यूएसवी पोर्ट भी है जो यूएसवी डोंगल तथा स्टोरेज डिवाइस को सपोर्ट करता है । कोई बात नहीं वाम्मी जीबी के अंदरूनी स्टोरेज के साथ आता है तथा इसकी मेमोरी को माइक्रो एसडी स्लॉट के द्वारा जीबी तक बढ़ाया जा सकता है । इसमें वाई फाई वी / जी / एन है किन्तु ब्लूटुथ नहीं है । पूरी तरह से चार्ज होने पर वाम्मी की बैटरी लगातार वाई फाई कनेक्सन पर घंटे तक अधिकतम चलती है साथ में कुछ मिनटों की नेट सर्फिंग भी की जा सकती है । यदि आप गेम खेलते है तो यह और कम चलती है । टैबलेट में की बैटरी लगी है जो टैबलेट के स्तर से कमतर है । कम ब्राइटनेस वाला डिसप्ले । इस टैबलेट में के डिसप्ले के साथ कॉलिंग सुविधा वो भी बिना हैडसेट के मौजूद है । सैमसंग गैलेक्सी टैब देखने में अपने चचेरे भाई मशहूर सैमसंग गैलेक्सी नोट से थोड़ा बड़ा और भारी लगता है । यूजर को पहली नजर में ही आकर्षित कर लेता है । डिवाइस की फ्लश्ड फ्रंट है जिसमें डिसप्ले के इर्द गिर्द मोटा काला बॉर्डर है । डिवाइस में ऊपर की ओर ईयर पीस छुपा है जो बातचीत करने में तो आसान है लेकिन टैबलेट के बड़े साइज के चलते थोड़ा बेढंगा सा है । यह के चेहरे मोहरे का संक्षिप्त सा ब्योरा है और हनीकॉम्ब का धन्यवाद डिवाइस कंट्रोल करने के लिए इस पर कोई फिजिकल बटन नहीं है । टैब में ग्लॉसी व्हाइट बैक है जिससे इसे क्लास का टच मिलता है और यह इसे छोटे मोटे धब्बों से बचाता है क्यूंकि यह सफेद की बनिस्बत काले रंग पर अधिक दिखाई देते हैं । डिवाइस की साइड ट्रिम पर एक सिल्वर रंग है जो इसके लुक्स को और भी बढ़ा देता है । इसकी बॉडी पॉली कार्बोनेट प्लास्टिक की बना है जो इसे मजबूती के साथ में हल्का वजन भी देती है । टैबलेट की प्लास्टिक केसिंग पूरी तरह से एक ही रंग में है इससे कुछ महीनों के इस्तेमाल के बाद यह बदरंग और धुंधली सी हो जाएगी । कुल मिला कर डिवाइस की बिल्ड क्वॉलिटी शानदार है लेकिन अपने बड़े साइज के चलते इसके गिरने पर टूटने की संभावना है । टैबलेट के डिसप्ले पर पूरी तरह स्क्रेच रेसिस्टेंट परत है । डिजाइन जैसे की हमने पहले बताया बहुत कुछ गैलेक्सी नोट जैसा है बस थोड़ा सा बड़ा है । हालांकि निस्संदेह डिवाइस पतली और हल्की है जिससे इसे पकड़ना तो आसान है ही काफी देर तक उठाया भी जा सकता है । डिवाइस में सिंपल इंटरफेस और तीन फिजिकल बटन हैं जो सभी दायें ओर लगे हैं । यह पॉवर और वॉल्यूम कंट्रोल करते हैं । डिसप्ले केपेसिटिव टच टेक्नोलॉजी प्रयोग करता है तो इसलिए स्क्रीन में कोई अंदरूनी मोड़ नहीं है और डिवाइस के फ्रंट पर इवन फिनिश है । बहुत अधिक बटन न होने से डिवाइस का डिजाइन बहुत साफ लगता है जिससे यह डिवाइस बहुत आकर्षक लगती है । स्पीकर और कनेक्टिविटी के सभी पोर्ट्स डिवाइस के नीचे दाईं ओर लगे हैं । इससे डिवाइस को चार्जिंग के दौरान भी इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है । सैमसंग में अपना ही चार्जिंग और डाटा पोर्ट होता है इसलिए यूजर को इसकी केबल हमेशा साथ रखनी होती है । डिसप्ले इंच का है जो पिक्सल का रिजॉल्यूशन देता है । डिसप्ले की डेनसिटी पिक्सल पर सक्वेयर इंच है तो यहां बहुत हाई लेवल की क्लियेरिटी बिना पिक्सलेशन के मिलती है । कलर रिप्रोडक्शन की बात करें तो डिसप्ले बहुत वाइब्रेंट है हालांकि यह गैलेक्सी स्मार्टफोन्स के एमोल्ड डिसप्ले जैसा शानदार नहीं है लेकिन इसमें कोई शिकायत नहीं है । सामान्य परिस्थिति में तो डिसप्ले आसानी से दिखता है लेकिन जब बहुत तेज रोशनी हो तो इसका ब्राइटनेस लेवल कम पड़ जाता है । इसका टच बहुत रिस्पांसिव और सटीक है विशेषतौर पर ब्राउजिंग के दौरान लिंक सिलेक्ट करने में । टचविज यूजर इंटरफेस इस डिवाइस के हार्डवेयर के साथ बेहतरीन काम करता है और परिणाम में मिलता है हर बार सटीक रिस्पांस विशेषकर जब आप गेम्स खेल रहे हों । सैमसंग गैलेक्सी टैब प्रयोग करता है एक्जनॉस डूअल कोर प्रोसेसर जो पर चलता है यही इसकी परफार्मेंस का रहस्य है । प्रोसेसर के साथ जीबी रैम है । इन सबका मतलब है बिना धीमा पड़े एप्पलीकेशन्स लोड होना । गेमिंग और मल्टीटास्किंग दोनों तेज हैं । गेमिंग के दौरान टैबलेट थोड़ी गरम होने लगती है और इसका बायां हिस्सा खासतौर पर गरम हो जाता है क्यूंकि प्रोसेसर यहीं लगा है इससे परफार्मेंस में कोई बदलाव नहीं होता । सैमसंग के इस डिवाइस में एक बेहतरीन टास्क मैनेजर यूटिलिटी है जिससे अगर आपको लगे कि परफार्मेंस धीमी हो गई है तो कोई भी सिर्फ इस एप्प पर जा कर रैम को फ्री कर सकता है । कॉलिंग का एक इंटिग्रल फीचर है और डेडिकेटिड एयरपीस के चलते इस डिवाइस पर बिना हैंड्सफ्री के भी कॉल की जा सकती है । कॉल क्वालिटी अच्छी है लेकिन इसे कान पर थामे रखना बहुत बेढंगा सा लगता है । कुल मिला कर परफार्मेंस फ्रंट पर डिवाइस में कोई कमी नहीं है और यह हर कार्य बहुत आसानी और आराम से करती है । डिवाइस इंटरनेट से कनेक्ट होने के लिए वाईफाई और का प्रयोग करती है । यह स्टेंडर्ड साइज का सिम स्लॉट प्रयोग करती है तो यूजर को माइक्रो सिम पर अपग्रेड होने की जरूरत नहीं है । डाटा स्पीड नेटवर्क पर निर्भर करती है लेकिन डिवाइस की आंतरिक परफार्मेंस निर्दोष है चाहे कॉलिंग हो या सर्फिंग । वायरलेस ट्रांसफर के लिए इसमें ब्लूटूथ है जो तेज है लेकिन पूरी पोटेंशियल दिखाने के लिए दूसरी डिवाइस भी टक्कर की होनी चाहिए । हालांकि ब्लूटूथ इस्तेमाल करते समय यह नोटिस किया गया कि बैटरी वाईफाई के मुकाबले इस पर ज्यादा तेजी से चुकती है । डिवाइस के साथ मल्टीपल कनेक्टिविटी ऑपशन है जो डिवाइस के साथ मिले इसके अपने यूएसबी केबल को पोर्ट से जोड़ने पर चलता है लेकिन यूजर को अन्य कनेक्टर्स जैसे यूएसबी और एचडीएमआई को अलग से खरीदना पड़ता है । सैमसंग गैलेक्सी टैब एक मल्टीमीडिया पॉवरहाउस है जो अधिकतर ऑडियो और वीडियो कोडेक्स को सपोर्ट करता है इसके साथ ही यूजर एंड्रॉयड बाजार से इसके लिए एप्पलीकेशन्स भी आसानी से डाउनलोड कर सकते हैं । में की इंटरनल स्टोरेज है जिसे फिल्में एप्पस संगीत तस्वीरें और डॉक्यूमेंट्स स्टोर किए जा सकते हैं और अगर आपकी जगह चुक गई हो तो इसको एसडीएचसी कार्ड की सहायता से तक बढ़ाया जा सकता है । इस डिवाइस में का फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा है जो हाई डेफिनिशन वीडियो कॉलिंग के लिए बढ़िया है हालांकि कैमरे का पूरा लाभ लेने के लिए एप्पलीकेशन होना जरूरी है । पीछे की ओर इसमें कैमरा कम रोशनी में इस्तेमाल के लिए फ्लैश के साथ है । कैमरे की क्वॉलिटी ब्राइट और मध्यम रोशनी में अच्छी है जबकि कम रोशनी में कैमरा स्वतः ही फ्लैश प्रयोग करता है । ब्राइट लाइट में ली गई तस्वीरें शार्प हैं लेकिन रात को या कम रोशनी में इमेजिस ग्रेनी सी हो जाती हैं । फिर भी पिक्चर क्वालिटी अन्य किसी भी डिवाइस से बेहतर है । इस डिवाइस का एक और फायदा है इसकी बैटरी लाइफ । सामान्य गेमिंग ऑडियो और वीडियो इस्तेमाल और और वाईफाई दोनों पर वेब ब्राउजिंग के साथ यह डिवाइस दो दिन तक बिना रीचार्ज किए चलती रही । इसका का बैटरी पैक सुनने में भले ही छोटा लगे लेकिन सच्चाई यह है कि डिवाइस के हार्डवेयर को फाइन ट्यून करके पॉवर कन्संप्शन और परफार्मेंस के लिए बैलेंस किया गया है । सैमसंग देखने में शानदार डिवाइस है जो जानदार परफार्मेंस भी देती है । यह उनके लिए बेहतरीन है जो एक ऐसा टैबलेट लेना चाहते हैं जिसमें सब कुछ मौजूद हो । कुल मिला कर हनिकॉम्ब इस डिवाइस के लिए अच्छा है और डिवाइस पूरी तरह से इसके लिए तैयार की गई है । यूएसबी होस्ट सपोर्ट और रैम फुल एचडी वीडियो प्लेबैक है । साधारण बिल्ड क्वॉलिटी है । होमस्क्रीन की एस्पेक्ट रेशो ठीक नहीं है । ब्लूटूथ और वॉल्यूम बटन नहीं है । के डिसप्ले के साथ जिंक टैबलेट के मुकाबले के अन्य टैबलेट्स में से कुछ हैं बीटेल रिलायंस एचसीएल और आईबेरी । जिंक जेड टैबलेट चीन में असेम्बल्ड है और बहुत ही बजट क्वॉलिटी की बिल्ड है । इस टैबलेट में सिंगल कोर विवान्ट जीसी मोबाइल प्रोसेसर है । टैबलेट में फुल यूएसबी पोर्ट है जो यूएसबी फ्लैश ड्राइव से डाटा पढ़ सकता है और टैबलेट को यूएसबी डाटा मॉडेम के प्रयोग से नेटवर्क से कनेक्ट कर सकता है । इस टैबलेट में एंड्रॉयड आईस क्रीम सैंडविच यूजर इंटरफेस है जिसे कस्टमाइजेशन की जरूरत नहीं है । आगे से देखने पर जिंक टैबलेट किसी भी अन्य टैबलेट जैसा है लेकिन तुलनात्मक रूप से थोड़ा पतला है । लुक्स की बात करें तो जिंक के जेड जेड और जेड टैबलेट्स एक से लगते हैं । जिंक में साईड में लगे सभी बटन को लेबल किया है । जिंक टैबलेट की बॉडी मैटे फिनिश की है और बैटरी के कारण थोड़ा भारी भी है । हाथ में बहुत अच्छा लगता है लेकिन अगर आप ने इसे ज्यादा जोर से पकड़ लिया तो यह टूट सकता है । स्क्रीन के चारों ओर लगा बेजल इसे अंगूठे द्वारा चलाते समय पकड़ने में आसान बनाता है । जब बात डिजाइन और फिनिशिंग की करें तो हमें लगता है कि यह इसकी कीमत के मुकाबले कुछ कमतर है । जिंक ने का केपेसिटिव डिसप्ले चुना है जो सच में बेहतरीन चीज है । सेफ रहने के लिए टैबलेट ड्ब्ल्यूवीजीए पिक्सल नेटिव रिजॉल्यूशन सपोर्ट करती है । इसका मतलब है कि इस रिजॉल्यूशन के लिए बनी ज्यादातर महत्वपूर्ण एप्पस इस पर डिफॉल्ट रूप से चलेंगी । हालांकि स्क्रीन वैसा क्रिस्प नहीं है जैसा की आदर्श रूप से उम्मीद की जा रही थी । किन्ही मायनों में हमें रिलायंस टैब की याद आ गई । अब एक ऐसा मुद्दा जो ग्राहक को गुस्सा दिला सकता है । इस टैबलेट को जब पोर्ट्रेट मोड में रखा जाए तो सारे होमस्क्रीन आईकन उठे हुए से दिखते हैं लेकिन जैसे ही आप इसे लैंडस्केप मोड में करते हैं स्क्रीन के टॉप पर से सारे आईकन और सर्च बार स्क्रीन से बाहर निकल जाती है । यह एस्पेक्ट रेशो का ईश्यू है और हम आशा करते हैं कि यह आने वाले अपडेट में फिक्स कर दिया जाएगा । स्क्रीन वेबपेज और टैक्स्ट बहुत ब्राइट दिखाता है जो इनके लिए फायदेमंद हैं । शुक्र है कि कंपनी ने केपेसिटिव टचस्क्रीन डिसप्ले दिया है जो ठीक ठाक रिस्पांसिव है । लेकिन अगर कई एप्पस चला दिए जाएं तो यह कम मेमोरी के चलते एकदम से रिस्पांस देना बंद कर देता है । चेसिस के नीचे जिंक जेड टैबलेट में सिंगल कोर विवान्टे जीसी है । टैबलेट में की मेमोरी है । जिंक ने टैबलेट कनेक्ट से वाई फाई कनेक्ट करने के लिए सिम स्लॉट की जगह वाई फाई दिया है कंपनी ने यूएसबी होस्टाइल फीचर भी दिया है । साइड में पूरे यूएसबी पोर्ट के साथ बाजार में मौजूद किसी भी डाटा मॉडम को इस टैबलेट पर चलाया जा सकता है । टैबलेट में सिर्फ का इंटरनल स्टोरेज है जिसे माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड की सहायता से जीबी तक बढ़ाया जा सकता है । हालांकि टैबलेट में ब्लूटूथ मॉड्यूल का फीचर नहीं है । लेकिन ईमानदारी से अगर इसमें तेज डाटा ट्रांसफर मोड यूएसबी होस्ट होता तो आप ब्लूटूथ के बारे में क्यों सोचते जिंक टैबलेट स्टॉक एंड्रॉयड आईस क्रीम सैंडविच ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम पर बिना कस्टमाइजेशन के चलता है । परंतु सचेत रहें इस टैबलेट पर हर एप्पलीकेशन न तो डाउनलोड और न इंस्टॉल हो सकती है । स्पष्ट तौर वे नहीं जो बेसिक हार्डवेयर सपोर्ट करती हों । कई मौकों पर हम कॉपी पेस्टिंग जैसे बेसिक फंक्शन्स भी आसानी से नहीं कर पाए । एस्पेक्ट रेशो की समस्या से नेटिव ब्राउसर पर फार्म भरने और कॉपी पेस्ट करने में परेशानी हुई । चूंकि टैबलेट में बेहतरीन ग्राफिक्स चिप नहीं है एप्प लोड होने में खुद ही सैकेंड ले लेते हैं । जिंक टैबलेट में यूएसबी होस्ट फीचर है जो यूएसबी फ्लैश स्टोरेज पर डाटा लिख और पढ़ सकता है । इसके अतिरिक्त टैबलेट पर बाजार में मौजूद ज्यादातर यूएसबी डॉन्गल्स डाटा कनेक्टिविटी के लिए प्रयोग किए जा सकते हैं । याद रखें केवल कुछ चुने हुए डॉन्गल्स ही इस पर काम करते हैं । अगर कनेक्ट हो जाएं तो आराम से चलते हैं । बैटरी स्टेटिस्टिक्स की बात करें तो सेल स्टेंडबाई प्रोसेस हाई कॉन्सम्पशन प्रतिशत दिखाता है जो कि आदर्श रूप से से फीसदी से अधिक नहीं होना चाहिए था । पैकेजिंग में फुल एचडी वीडियो सपोर्ट की बात कही गई थी और हमें बहुत हैरानी हुई कि वाकई में फुल एचडी वीडियो चल सकी । यह एवीआई फार्मेट्स को सपोर्ट करता है तो इसपर हमें वीडियो इंटरटेन्मेन्ट का अहसास जरूर हुआ । इस टैबलेट को मिनी एचडीएमआई पोर्ट की सहायता से बड़े डिसप्ले से जोड़ा जा सकता है लेकिन इसके साथ केबल नहीं मिलती है । इस टैबलेट पैक के साथ लीथियम आईऑन बैटरी मिलती है । इसका मूल मंत्र यह है कि अगर आप नेटवर्क फंक्शन्स को बंद रखेंगे तो सामान्य प्रयोग पर यह टैबलेट बेहतरीन बैटरी बैकअप देगी । अगर आप वाई फाई और / या नेटवर्क डॉन्गल लगाए रखेंगे तो यह आसानी से पांच से छह घंटे चल जाएगी । इसके अलावा टैबलेट की बैटरी लाइफ औसत ही है । बेशक एक टैबलेट एंड्रॉयड आईस क्रीम सैंडविच के साथ रुपये में सुनने में अच्छा लगता है लेकिन यह डिवाइस आम लोगों की जरूरतों से बहुत दूर है । अगर इसकी कमियों को दूर करने वाला अपडेट लाया जाए तो इसका एंड्रॉयड आईसीएस बेहतरीन परफार्मेंस देगा । पहली नजर में हमें लगा था कि इसकी स्पेसिफिकेशन और एंड्रॉयड आईसीएस आधारित बजट सेगमेंट का टैबलेट हमें आकर्षित कर लेगा । जरूर यह अपनी रैम के कारण अच्छा तो है लेकिन इसके प्रोसेसर और ग्राफिक्स की कमियों ने इसे बेकार कर दिया है । मुख्य रूप से इसके साधारण स्क्रीन वॉल्यूम कंट्रोल बटनों का और ब्लूटूथ न होना आपको दो बार सोचने के लिए मजबूर कर देगा । मूलतः इंच का टैबलेट एल्युमिनियम के खूबसुरत कवर तथा सामने के काले रंग के साथ लांच किया गया था हालांकि हुवैई ने अन्य रंगों के विकल्प की घोषणा की है जिसमें शामिल है हल्का काला क्लासिक ब्राउन एवं चटक गुलाबी । अब बनावट की बात करे तो टैबलेट की वजन ग्राम निश्चित रूप से कम है । मीडिया पैड में पीछे का कवर चमकदार एल्युमिनियम का है जिसके ऊपरी और निचले शिरों पर त्रिकोणीय कवर पोरट्रेट मोड में पकड़ने पर दिखाई देते है जो निश्चित रूप से ध्यान आकर्षित करते हैं । नीचे की तरफ लगे त्रिकोणीय ढक्कन के अंदर सिम और कार्ड का स्थान है जबकि बैटरी टैबलेट के सामान्य नियमानुसार खोली नहीं जा सकती है । हालांकि पिछला ढक्कन वर्ग विशेषत्व का एहसास कराता है लेकिन त्रिकोणीय ढक्कन रबड़ के साथ मजबूत तथा सुंदर दिखते है इन ढक्कनों को हटाना बहुत आसान है । यह टैबलेट एल्युमिनियम के साथ पूरी तरह से प्रोफेशनल लगते है जबकि नए रंगों के समायोजन आंखों को बांधते है और बनावट भी उच्च कोटि की है जो एक दो बार गिरने पर बर्दास्त कर सकती है । टैबलेट के दाहिनी उपरी तरफ वाल्यूम रॉकर के बगल में पॉवर ऑन ऑफ बटन है जबकि पोंर्ट्रेट मोड में पकड़ने परा नीचे मिनी एवं मिनी पोर्ट तथा चार्जर की जगह है । मिमी का जैक ऊपर की तरफ दोनों स्पीकर के पीछे है जबकि वाई तरफ कोई की या पोर्ट नहीं है । कीज का स्थान ठीक है पर स्पीकर्स का स्थान थोड़ा गड़बड़ है क्योंकि लैण्डस्कैप मोड में वीडियो गेम खेलते समय या मूवी देखते समय कम से कम एक स्पीकर ढक जाता है जिससे आवाज दब जाती है । हुवैई मीडिया पैड इंच के डिस्प्ले तथा पिक्सल रिजोल्यूशन के साथ आता है । एसर आइकोनिया में कैपेसिटिव टचस्क्रीन पिक्सल रेजोल्यूशन पिक्सल घनत्व और निट्स की ब्राइटनेस है । इंच के सैमसंग गैलेक्सी टैबलेट में पिक्स रेजोल्यूशन है । अतः निश्चित रूप से डिसप्ले के लिहाज से मीडिया पैड एक बेहतरीन पैड है जिसे आप महसूस कर सकते हैं । मीडिया पैड में टेक्नालॉजी के कारण व्यूइंग एंगल विस्तृत है । तथा पूर्ण ब्राइटनेस के होने पर जिसे आप सेटिंग मैन्यू में जाकर नियंत्रित कर सकते हैं आप तेज धूम में भी फिल्म देख सकते हैं । इसके ब्राइट डिसप्ले का निश्चित रूप से शुक्रगुजार हूं । इसमें गेम खेलने या वीडियो देखने का अपना अलग आनंद है । टैबलेट की स्क्रीन को अंगुलियों के निशान या अन्य निशानों से खतरा है जिन्हें साफ करना काफी कठिन होता है । अन्य टैबलेट की तरह मीडिया पैड में भी व्यवाहारिक रूप से स्क्रीन पर बटन नहीं है । अतः आपको किसी एप्पलीकेशन के लिए कैपेसिटिव कीज का सहारा लेना पड़ता है । स्क्रीन पर आप एप्पस एवं ऑइकन ऊपर दाहिनी तरफ पाते हैं । पहला आपको सभी एप्पलीकेशन से जोड़ता है जबकि प्लस ऑइकन आपको अपनी स्क्रीन पर किसी एप्पलीकेशन का शॉर्टकट बनाने में मदद करता है । नीचे बायीं तरफ आप बैक तथा मिनिमाइज के निशान पाते हैं । साथ में एक निशान चल रहे एप्पलीकेशन को दर्शाता है । इस प्रकार आप आसानी से किसी भी एप्प को करेंट टैब से बंद कर सकते हैं तथा इसी के द्वारा आप हाल ही में बंद किए गए एप्प को पुनः देख सकते हैं । किसी एप्प को हटाना भी बहुत आसान है । किसी एप्प पर अपनी अंगुली रखे और या तो इसे किसी होमपैज पर डाल दें या अनस्टॉल ऑइकन जो ऊपर दाहिनी तरफ है पर खींचकर छोड़ दें । हनीकॉम्ब की केवल कमी यह है कि सिम के लिए जगह होने के वाबजूद यह बात नहीं कराता है । आप केवल सेवाओं का मजा ले सकते हैं । इस टैबलेट में का डुअल कोर प्रसोसर है जोकि अपेक्षित अच्छा परफार्मेंस देता है । हमने बहुत से सघन गेम जैसे अस्फाल्ट टेंपल रन आदि खेले हैं पर टैबलेट ने कभी भी किसी भी शिकायत का मौका नहीं दिया है जैसे फ्रीज होना या लैग आना जबकि कई एप्प एक साथ चल रहे थे । यह सही है कि टैबलेट गेम खेलते समय बहुत जल्दी गरम हो जाते है लेकिन कुछ हद तक यह सामान्य बात है । हुवैई मीडिया पैड के बारे में एक सामान्य शिकायत बैटरी बैकअप कम होना है । टैबलेट में ली पॉलीमर बैटरी लगी है जो कागजी रूप से अच्छी लगती है । इसे फीसदी चार्ज करने पर हमनें दो घंटे फिल्म देखी मिनट तक गेम खेला और मिनट तक ब्लुटूथ हेंडसेट के साथ गाने सुने । तब भी बैटरी में कुछ क्षमता बाकी थी । अतः यह विश्वास किया जा सकता है कि अगर पूरी तरह चार्ज बैटरी है तो पूरे दिन काम चल जाएगा । जहां तक मल्टीमीडिया फंक्शन का सवाल है तो इसमें मल्टी फार्मेट विडीयो एवं ऑडियो प्लेयर लगा है । आप एंड्रॉयड मार्केट से बहुत से मीडिया प्लेयर डाउनलोड कर सकते हैं । टैबलेट के ऊपरी हिस्से में लगे दो स्पीकर काफी तेज आवाज देते हैं । अतः यदि आप अपना हेंडसेट भूल गए हैं तो परेशान न हो क्योंकि स्पीकर किसी भी माहौल में काफी तेज आवाज देते हैं आवाज स्पष्ट है तथा जैसा कि पहले कहा जा चुका है कि विजुअल इतने अच्छे हैं कि सांस थम जाए और निश्चित रूप से आप डिवाइस पर मूवी देखने में आनंदित होंगे । हुवैई मीडिया पैड में डुअल कैमरा है एक मेगापिक्सल ऑटोफोकस उच्च डेफीनिशन वाला पिछला एवं मेगापिक्सल का सामने वाला कैमरा चैटिंग के लिए । पिछले कैमरे के द्वारा बेहतर रंगों एवं कांट्रस्ट के साथ आप फोटो खींच सकते हैं किंतु फ्लैश न होने के कारण कम रोशनी में इसका प्रयोग नहीं किया जा सकता है । हां बैटरी बैकअप में आपको थोड़ा सा निराश कर सकता है किंतु आवाज एवं विजुअल के मामलों में निश्चित रूप से आप इसकी तारीफ करेंगे । परफार्मेंस के मामले में मीडिया पैड आपको निराश नहीं करेगा लेकिन नियमित फुल होने पर और अच्छा होता अंदरूनी स्टोरेज भी इसका कम है । मात्र की मेमोरी उसमें भी आप केवल का ही प्रयोग कर सकते है जोकि इंच वाले सैमसंग के गैलेक्सी टैब की की मेमोरी की तुलना में काफी कम है या इंच वाले एसर आईकोनिया टैब या सोनी टैब की तुलना में भी कम है । ये सभी लगभग समान कीमत या मीडिया पैड से कम कीमत पर उपलब्ध हैं । स्क्रीन रेजोल्यूशन खराब है । यह इंच का टैबलेट बिना शक बहुत स्लीक और स्टाइलिश है जिसमें डूअल टोन कलर स्कीम है जो डिवाइस को क्लॉस टच देती है । फनबुक भी इन्हीं में से एक है और जहां तक इसके डिजाइन की बात है इसमें अभी भी बहुत कुछ किया जाना बाकी है । फनबुक का आसान मगर उपयोगी डिजाइन है जिसमें दो आवरणों के बीच में टैबलेट के इंटरनल कॉम्पोनेंट्स सुरक्षित हैं । टैबलेट दो रंगों में आती है स्लेट ग्रे और मिडनाइट ब्लैक । हमारे पास स्लेट ग्रे वर्जन है । ग्लॉस की संगत ने इसकी खूबसूरती को और बढ़ा दिया है लेकिन इससे इसपर छूने से लगने वाले धब्बों की आशंका बढ़ गई है । माइक्रोमैक्स फनबुक में इंच का डिसप्ले पिक्सल रिजॉल्यूशन के साथ है । रिजॉल्यूशन यकीनन कम है लेकिन चूंकि यह लो कॉस्ट टैबलेट है हमें इससे कोई परेशानी नहीं है । यह डिसप्ले ज्यादातर मामलों में अच्छा प्रदर्शन कर रहा है । कलर रिप्रॉडक्शन के मामले में डिस्पले थोड़ा निराश करता है लेकिन जब ब्राइटनेस की बात करें तो डिसप्ले बहुत आकर्षक लगता है और यह खासियत इस डिवाइस पर चलने वाली हर एप्पलीकेशन और गेम में देखी जा सकती है । इस फनबुक में रिजॉल्यूशन कम होने के बावजूद निर्माता ने इसमें मल्टी पाइंट टच इनपुट सिस्टम की सुविधा दी है । मल्टी पाइंट टच उन एप्पलीकेशन्स या गेम्स में जरूरी होता है जिनमें एक ही समय में कई इनपुट्स देने होते हैं और यह बहुत तेज टाइपिंग गति के लिए भी अच्छा होता है । हालांकि टच में सूक्ष्मता का आभाव है और कभी कभी इस्तेमाल के दौरान टच सही स्थान पर नहीं हो पाया । हमें यह परेशानी तब हुई जब हमने इस पर एक एप्प गेम चला रहे थे अचानक गलती से उसके साथ ही एक और एप्पलीकेशन भी चल पड़ी । माइक्रोमैक्स फनबुक की एक और विशेषता है इसमें लगा डूअल कोर का ग्राफिक प्रोसेसर जिससे इस डिवाइस पर फुल का वीडियो प्लेबैक की सुविधा भी है पर एक बार फिर कम डिसप्ले रिजॉल्यूशन हाई डेफिनिशन कॉन्टेंट के मजे को खराब कर देता है जिससे यूजर मिनी पोर्ट का इस्तेमाल कर इस कॉनटेंट का मजा किसी अन्य बड़े स्कीन पर ले पाता है । चूंकि इस पैकेज में कोई एडॉप्टर शामिल नहीं है तो यूजर को इसे अलग से ही खरीदना होगा । माइक्रोमैक्स फनबुक की बिल्ट क्वॉलिटी बेहतरीन है और इसकी क्वॉलिटी बिलकुल वैसी ही है । बॉडी पॉलिकार्बोनेट शैल की बनी है जो हल्की होने के साथ ही मजबूत भी है यह डिवाइस कम दूरी पर से दुर्घटनावश गिरने से तो बचाव सकती है । डूअल कोर प्रोसेसर जो कोर्टेक्स आर्किटैक्चर आधारित है और पर चलता है ने इस फनबुक को तेज और हल्के व मध्यम दर्जे के कई काम एक साथ की ताकत दी है । इस प्रोसेसर के साथ की है जो इस डिवाइस के लिए जरूरी भी है लेकिन हमें लगता है कि इस डिवाइस को और तेजी से कार्य करने के लिए कुछ अधिक की जरूरत है । इस डिवाइस पर गूगल एंड्रॉयड आईस क्रीम सैंडविच ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम अपने शुरूआती रूप में काम कर रहा है जिसके साथ कोई अन्य यूजर इंटरफेस नहीं है । अब जबकि ऐसी डिवाइसेज के लिए बन गए हैं जिनमें सिर्फ जरूरी या बिल्कुल भी हार्डवेयर बटन न हों फिर भी फनबुक के साथ तीन हार्डवेयर बटन दिए गए हैं । अधिक बटन होने से किसी तरह का नुकसान नहीं है पर इससे इस डिवाइस के लुक्स में कमी जरूर आई है । फनबुक ऑफिशियली गूगल प्ले रजिस्टर्ड डिवाइस है मतलब इस पर सभी कॉम्पिटेबल एप्पलीकेशन्स डाउनलोड और इस्तेमाल की जा सकती हैं । सामान्य परिस्थितियों में डिवाइस अच्छा प्रदर्शन करती है लेकिन जैसी ही आप इस पर मल्टी टास्किंग या कई एप्पलीकेशन्स का इस्तेमाल कर काम बढ़ाते हैं अपनी कम के चलते यह डिवाइस धीमी होने लगती है । इस डिवाइस का ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम ऑप्टिमाइजेशन अपने आप ऑन हो जाता है जिससे आपको कॉम्पेटिबिलिटी की समस्या नहीं होती है । इसका के प्रोसेसर पर हर तरह का काम कर सकते हैं चाहे वो गेमिंग हो या मल्टीमीडिया आसानी से किया जा सकता है । मेमोरी की कमी बारंबार दिखती है । टैम्पल रन खेलने के दौरान इस टैबलेट ने लोड होने में बहुत अधिक समय लिया और यह एक झटके के साथ स्टार्ट हो कर आधारित टैबलेट जो पर चलती हैं के मुकाबले धीमी गति से रीलोड होने लगी । माइक्रोमैक्स फनबुक में लगी के चलते इसका मल्टीमीडिया प्रदर्शन शानदार है क्योंकि इसकी ज्यादाकर एप्पलीकेशन्स कार्ड पर इंस्टॉल होने से डिवाइस की सिस्टम मेमोरी में अधिक जगह रहती है जिससे यह तेज गति से कार्य करती है । यह डिवाइस पर अधिकतर ऑडियो और वीडियो कोडेक्स को इसका ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम सपोर्ट करता है पर फनबुक की मल्टीमीडिया की सुविधा को और बेहतर करने के लिए यूजर एंड्रॉयड मार्केट से मोबो प्लेयर जैसी एप्पलीकेशन्स भी आसानी से डाउनलोड कर सकते हैं । इस डिवाइस में की इंटरनल मेमोरी है जिसे कार्ड की सहायता से बढ़ा कर तक भी किया जा सकता है । इस डिवाइस में मेगापिक्सल का फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा है जो वीडियो कॉन्फ्रेंसिंग के दौरान अच्छा काम करता है । कैमरा तेज रोशनी में अच्छा काम करता है लेकिन इसका कम रेजॉल्यूशन इसे समान पिक्चर और वीडियो बनाने में असमर्थ करता है । इंटरनेट कनेक्टिविटी के लिए आप इसमें और डॉन्गल्स प्रयोग कर सकते हैं । फनबुक जहां तेज और बेहतरीन कनेक्टिविटी देता है वहीं डॉन्गल्स की स्पीड आपके द्वारा लिये गए डाटा प्लान से निर्धारित होगी और आज भी तेज डाटा प्लान की कीमत भी कुछ अधिक ही है । साथ ही इसमें प्रयोग करने के लिए आपको डाटा डॉन्गल्स प्रयोग करने के लिए एडॉप्टर या ड्राइव खरीदने की जरूरत नहीं हैं क्योंकि यह इसके बॉक्स के साथ ही मिलते हैं । फनबुक की बैटरी लाइफ ने हमें निराश किया । की बैटरी इस डिवाइस को आवश्यक समय तक चलाने में नाकाम रही । एक बार पूरी तरह से चार्ज होने पर यह बैटरी सामान्य इस्तेमाल पर एक दिन और लगातार वीडियो देखने पर घंटे और पर वेब ब्राउजिंग के साथ घंटे तक का पॉवर बैकअप देती है । डिवाइस के साथ मिले चार्जर से इसे पूरी तरह चार्ज करने में लगभग घंटे लगते हैं लेकिन पहले घंटे में ही डिवाइस फीसदी तक चार्ज हो जाती है । भारत का सबसे सस्ता कहा जाने वाला यह टैबलेट माइक्रोमैक्स फनबुक यकीन आकाश टैबलेट के चाहनेवालों के लिए यह नया मौका है जरा से अधिक पैसे खर्च करने पर आपको मिलेगा एक सुपरचार्जड टैबलेट । लेकिन अन्य आधारित टैबलेट्स के मुकाबले फनबुक कुछ फीका सा लगता है । हमारे द्वारा अभी रिव्यू किए गए के मुकाबले यह टैबलेट थोड़ा धीमा लेकिन रुपये सस्ता भी है । माइक्रोमैक्स इस टैबलेट के साथ कुछ शैक्षणिक सामग्री भी दे रही है जिसे यूजर अपनी जरूरत के मुताबिक अलग से खरीद सकते हैं । कुल मिला कर माइक्रोमैक्स फनबुक बहुत बढ़िया प्रॉडक्ट है जो आपके पैसे की पूरी कीमत तो लौटाता ही है अपने यूजर को भी उत्कृष्टता का अहसास कराता है । माइक्रोसॉफ्ट सरफेस टैबलेट विंडोज ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम अपडेट हो जाएगा । फिलहाल ये विंडोज पर काम कर रहा है । इसकी कीमत $ रुपए लगभग है । कंपनी की इस घोषणा से सभी टेक एक्सपर्ट्स खुश हैं । स्पार्टन वो वेब ब्राउजर है जिसे एक्सप्लोरर की जगह विंडोज ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम में रखा है । पतला और हल्का है । माइक्रोसॉफ्ट का सरफेस टैबलेट आम टैबलेट्स से पतला है । माइक्रोसॉफ्ट का ये अब तक का सबसे पतला टैबलेट है । इस टैबलेट का डायमेंशन इंच का है और इसका वजन ग्राम है । हालांकि बाकी एंड्रॉइड टैबलेट्स से तुलना करें तो ये फिर भी भारी है । फुल एचडी डिस्प्ले है । माइक्रोसॉफ्ट सरफेस में इंच की क्लियरटाइप फुल प्लस डिस्प्ले स्क्रीन है । ये स्क्रीन * पिक्सल का रेजोल्यूशन देती है । माइक्रोसॉफ्ट सरफेस में बहुत से ऐप्स का इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है सबसे खास बात ये है कि थर्ड पार्टी ऐप्स भी इस टैबलेट में चलते हैं । नए डिवाइस में कई बदलाव कर इसे बेहतर बनाने की कोशिश की गई है । डिजाइन की बात करें तो किंडल वोएज में इंच की डिस्प्ले स्क्रीन के साथ ईपेपर टेक्नोलॉजी और फ्रंट लाइट दी गई है जो ऑटोमैटिकली एडजस्ट हो जाती है । इस डिवाइस में की इंटरनल मेमोरी दी गई है । पतला ये ईरीडर किंडल सीरीज का सबसे पतला डिवाइस है । ये डिवाइस पिक्सल प्रति इंच की डेन्सिटी देता है । इस डिवाइस का मेजरमेंट का है । सेक्यू टैबलेट के फीचर्स सैमसंग गैलेक्सी टैब जैसे हैं । इसमें सेक्यू स्मार्ट कंपनी के हाई ग्रेड कम्यूनिकेशन सूट के भी फीचर्स डाले गए हैं । गर इस टैबलेट में कोई मालवेयर इंस्टॉल होता है तो भी टैब में मौजूद सेंसिटिव डाटा सुरक्षित रहेगा । यह टेक्नोलॉजी आईबीएम की ओर से जोड़ी गई है । इस टैबलेट में कुछ एप्लीकेशन के साथ वीडियो देखने और गेम्स खेलने की सुविधा है । इस टैबलेट में एटम प्रोसेसर के साथ कार्टून नेटवर्क और पोगो का कंटेंट मौजूद है । इस टैबलेट में बच्चे बुक पढ़ सकेंगे और गेम्स सीख सकेंगे । ये दोनों टैबलेट एंड्रॉइड के वर्जन ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम पर काम करेंगे । लेनोवो योगा प्रो टैबलेट योगा प्रो से प्रतिशत पतला और प्रतिशत हल्का है । इंच की स्क्रीन के साथ * पिक्सल का रेजोल्यूशन दिया जाता है । इस डिवाइस में कंपनी ने इंटेल कोर प्रोसेसर रखा है । इसके अलावा रैम है । हार्ड डिस्क के साथ लेनोवो योगा प्रो में वॉट ऑवर बैटरी है । कंपनी के अनुसार ये घंटों की बैटरी लाइव देती है । यह नेशनल पार्क एक सींग वाले गैंडे राइनोसेरोस के लिए दुनियाभर में जाना जाता है । यहां पर गैंडे की आबादी सबसे अधिक है । असम में ब्रह्मपुत्र

और नगीने उखड़ गए हैं । संगमरमर के पत्थर भी चटके हैं । मगर इस तरफ कोई ध्यान नहीं दिया जा रहा । अद्भुत पच्चीकारी और दीवाल में जड़े खूबसूरत नगीने । सिविल कोर्ट में इसे शिवालय घोषित करने की मांग को लेकर वाद दायर किया गया है । वहीं संसद की पर्यावरण संबंधी स्थायी समिति ने भी निरीक्षण कर उसके पीले पडऩे पर मुहर लगा दी है । मगर इससे भी बड़ी चिंता उसकी खासियत के अस्तित्व को बचाने की है । ताज की खूबसूरती उसकी पच्चीकारी और एकरूपता में है । एक तरफ जिस डिजाइन में पच्चीकारी की गई है दूसरी ओर भी हूबहू वही डिजाइन है । मगर अब मुख्य मकबरे पर ताज की पच्चीकारी बदशक्ल हो रही है । कई जगह यह पूरी तरह नष्ट हो गई है तो कहीं पच्चीकारी युक्त पत्थर दीवाल से निकल रहे हैं । मुगल काल में पत्थरों के ज्वाइंट को मजबूत बनाने के लिए लगाई गई लोहे की क्लिप की वजह से कई जगह संगमरमर के पत्थर चटक गए हैं । जिससे ताज का सौंदर्य नष्ट हो रहा है । भारतीय पुरातत्व सर्वेक्षण एएसआइ ने ताज के निकले खूबसूरत नगीने दोबारा जडऩे की योजना तैयार की थी मगर यह अब तक कागजों से निकलकर अमल में नहीं आ पाई है । शनिवार को निरीक्षण के लिए आई संसदीय समिति ने भी ताज की पच्चीकारी के नष्ट होने पर उसकी समानता नष्ट होने पर चिंता जताई थी । समिति ने अफसरों से ताज के संरक्षण की समग्र योजना मांगने के साथ विदेशों से एक्सपर्ट बुलाने के निर्देश दिए हैं । जिससे कि ताज की खासियत उसकी समानता बरकरार रहे । ताज के निर्माण के लिए सफेद संगमरमर मकराना की खानों से मंगवाया गया था । वहीं पच्चीकारी के लिए चीन रूस इराक तिब्बत अफगानिस्तान श्रीलंका आदि देशों से पत्थर मंगाया गया था । भारत की खोज सड़कों पर सफर करते हुए की जा सकती है । उन विहंगम छटाओं को जिसे देखकर आपकी ज़ुबाँ से बरबस ही उसकी प्रशंसा में शब्द निकल पड़े । अतुल्य भारत और उसकी प्राकृतिक छटा को महानगरों में नहीं बल्कि इन सड़कों के दोनों ओर देखा जा सकता है । गाड़ियों की खिड़कियों से क्षण प्रतिक्षण तेजी से गुजरते हुए वन धान के खेत हिमाच्छिदत पहाड़ों की चोटियाँ किसी के भी सफर को सुहाना बनाने

पहाड़ियों नदियों और वनों से गुजरते हुए पश्चिम में अरब सागर की ओर जाती है जिसके दोनों ओर धान के खेत और नारियल के पेड़ एक विहंगम दृश्य की रचना करते दिखते हैं । पहाड़ियों को नज़दीक से देखने के श़ौकीन लोगों के लिये शिमला से किन्नौर का रास्ता चरम सुख देने वाला हो सकता है । इस मार्ग पर सफर करते हुए शाहबलूत से बुरूंश और लाल पीले सेबों के ब़ागों से होते हुए किन्नौर कैलाश चोटी के जरिये प्रकृति को अपनी

की बावड़ी देश भर में प्रसिद्ध है । हालांकि इन दिनों बावड़ी का एक हिस्सा गिरा हुआ है इसके बावजूद यहां पर्यटक आते हैं । जलभरत तालाब के सुंदर घाट प्राचीन मंदिर महात्माओं की समाधि व आज भी यहां सजता पनघट ग्रामीण पर्यटन के आदर्श कहे जा सकते हैं । बस तालाब के इलाके का सुंदरीकरण करना है । यहां कुछ दूरी पर ही चौबीसी का ऐतिहासिक चबूतरा है जो देशभर में चर्चित है । हाईवे से गुजरने वाले पर्यटक इस चबूतरे को देखना नहीं भूलते । चबूतरे के पास मुरंड तालाब का सौंदर्य व ऐतिहासिकता भी किताबों में लिखा जाने योग्य है । हरे भरे घने जंगलों प्राकृतिक दृश्यों और पांच पहाड़ियों के बीच बसा राजगीर भारत का सबसे पवित्र स्थल माना जाता है । राजगीर न सिर्फ एक प्रसिद्ध धार्मिक तीर्थस्थल है बल्कि एक खुबसूरत हेल्थ रेसॉर्ट के रूप में भी लोकप्रिय है । यहां प्राकृतिक सौंदर्य के साथ विविध संस्कृतियां देशी विदेशी पर्यटकों को आकर्षित करती हैं । पटना से लगभग किमी और नालंदा से किमी दूर राजगीर हिन्दू जैन और बौद्ध तीनों धर्मो के धार्मिक स्थल हैं । खासकर बौद्ध धर्म से इसका बहुत प्राचीन संबंध है । बुद्ध न सिर्फ कई वर्षो तक यहां ठहरे थे बल्कि कई महत्वपूर्ण उपदेश भी राजगीर की धरती पर दिए थे । बुद्ध के उपदेशों को यहीं लिपिबद्ध किया गया गया था और पहली बौद्ध संगीति भी यहीं हुई थी । राजगीर शांति और सौहार्द का स्तंभ है जो आज भी प्राचीनकाल के अवशेष से भरा पड़ा है । भगवान महावीर ने अपना प्रथम प्रवचन राजगीर के विपुलागिरि नामक स्थान पर प्रारंभ किया था । राजगीर पांच चट्टानी पहाड़ियों से घिरा है । जिसका जिक्र महाभारत और रामायण में

दृश्यों को देखने पर्यटक देश विदेश से आते हैं । गृद्धकूट पर्वत भगवान महात्मा बुद्ध गृद्धकूट पर्वत पर बैठकर लोगों को कई महत्वपूर्ण उपदेश दिए थे । जापान के बुद्ध संघ ने इसकी चोटी पर एक विशाल शांति स्तूप

खूबसूरत जगह है । गर्म जल के झरने वैभव पर्वत की सीढि़यों पर मंदिरों के बीच गर्म जल के कई झरने सप्तधाराएं हैं जहां सप्तकर्णी गुफाओं से जल आता है । इन झरनों के पानी में कई चिकित्सकीय गुण होने के प्रमाण मिले हैं । पहाड़ों के बीच बने जैन मंदिरों को दूर से देखा जा सकता है । क्योंकि वहां पहुंचने का रास्ता अत्यंत दुर्गम है । जैन धर्म के महावीर संस्थापक भी मंदिरों में कई बार आते थे । राजगीर महोत्सव हर साल

मलमास मेला तीन वर्षो में एक बार आने वाला मलमास के दौरान राजगीर में विश्व प्रसिद्ध मेला लगता है । इस साल नये साल वाले दिन ही कश्मीर यात्रा के लिये सपरिवार जाना हुआ था । इस यात्रा में कश्मीर की डल झील निशात बाग शालीमार बाग व अन्य बाग के अलावा पहलगाम यात्रा की गयी थी । बीकानेर यात्रा में राकेश के साथ लडेरा गाँव स्थित मरुभूमि महोत्सव देखने का कार्यक्रम बनाया गया था । गजब का नजारा था ... थोड़ी थोड़ी दूर पर उफनते जलप्रपात गाड़ी की विंड स्क्रीन से टकराती बारिश की मोटी मोटी बूँदे सड़क की काली लकीर की अगल बगल चहलकदमी करते बादल और मन मोहती हरियाली ... सफर के कुछ अदभुत दृश्यों में से ये भी एक था । पहाड़ के बीचों बीच पतले झरने की सफेद लकीर चट्टानों के इस विशाल जाल के सामने बौनी प्रतीत हो रही थी । पर असली नजारा तो दूसरी ओर था । पर्वतों और सूरज के बीच की ऐसी आँखमिचौनी मैंने पहले कभी नहीं देखी थी । पहाड़ के ठीक सामने का हिस्सा जिधर हमारा होटल था अभी भी अंधकार में डूबा था । दूर दूसरे शिखर के पास एक छोटा सा पेड़ किरणों की प्रतीक्षा में अपनी बाहें फैलाये खड़ा था । उधर बादलों की चादर को खिसकाकर सूर्य किरणें अपना मार्ग प्रशस्त कर रहीं थीं । थोड़ी ही देर में ये किरणें कंचनजंघा की बर्फ से लदी चोटियों को यूँ प्रकाशमान करने लगीं मानो भगवन ने पहाड़ के उस छोर पर बड़ी सी सर्चलाइट जला रखी हो । शायद वर्षों तक ये दृश्य मेरे स्मृतिपटल पर अंकित रहे । अपने सफर के इस यादगार लमहे को मैं अपने कैमरे में कैद कर सका ये मेरी खुशकिस्मती है । सुबह की धूप का आनंद लेते हुये हम यूमथांग की ओर चल पड़े । सारा रास्ता बैंगनी रंग के इन छोटे छोटे फूलों से अटा पड़ा था । करीब डेढ़ घंटे के सफर के बाद हम यूमथांग में थे । यूमथांग की सुन्दरता के जितने चर्चे हमने सुन रखे थे उस हिसाब से हमें निराश होना पड़ा । चुन्गथांग की हसीन वादियों और चाय की चुस्कियों के साथ सफर की थकान जाती रही । लाचेन घाटी पूरी तरह गाढ़ी सफेद धुंध की गिरफ्त में थी और वाहन की खिड़की से आती हल्की फुहारें मन को शीतल कर रहीं थीं । पर हम तो मन ही मन रोमांचित हो रहे थे उस अगली सुबह के इंतजार में जो शायद हमें उस नीले आकाश के और पास ले जा सके लाचेन से आगे का रास्ता फिर थोड़ा पथरीला था । सड़क कटी कटी सी थी । कहीं कहीं पहाड़ के ऊपरी हिस्से में भू स्खलन होने की वजह से उसके ठीक नीचे के जंगल बिलकुल साफ हो गये थे । आगे की आबादी ना के बराबर थी । बीच बीच में याकों का समूह जरूर दृष्टिगोचर हो जाता था । बचपन में भूगोल का पढ़ा हुआ पाठ याद आ रहा था कि जैसे जैसे ऊपर की ओर बढ़ेंगे वैसे वैसे वनस्पति का स्वरूप बदलेगा । इसी तथ्य की गवाही हमारे अगल बगल का परिदृश्य भी दे रहा था । चौड़ी पत्ती वाले पेड़ों की जगह अब नुकीली पत्ती वाले पेड़ो ने ले ली थी । पर ये क्या थान्गू पहुँचते पहुँचते तो ये भी गायब होने लगे थे । रह गये थे तो बस छोटे छोटे झाड़ीनुमा पौधे । नीला आसमान नंगे पहाड़ और बर्फ आच्छादित चोटियाँ मिलकर ऐसा मंजर प्रस्तुत कर रहे थे जैसे हम किसी दूसरी ही दुनिया में हों । मन ही मन इस बात का उत्साह भी था कि आखिर सकुशल इस ऊँचाई पर पहुँच ही गये । झील का दृश्य बेहद मनमोहक था । वो यहाँ से जो साथ हुईं .... क्या बताऊँ पूरा सफर उसकी मोहक इठलाती तो कभी बलखाती अदाओं को निहारने में ही बीता । सुबह हुई और साथ वालों ने खबर दी की बाहर हो आओ अच्छा नज़ारा है । होटल के ठीक बाहर जैसे ही सड़क पर कदम रखा सामने का दृश्य ऐसा था मानो कंचनजंघा की चोटियाँ बाहें खोल हमारा स्वागत कर रही हों । सुबह का गंगतोक शाम से भी प्यारा था । पहाड़ों की सबसे बड़ी खासियत यही है कि यहाँ मौसम बदलते देर नहीं लगती । ताशी विउ प्वाइंट से हमने उत्तरी सिक्किम राजमार्ग की राह पकड़ी और थोड़ी ही देर में समझ लिया कि पहाड़ पर आने के पहले भगवान को अच्छी मनःस्थिति यानि गुड ह्यूमर में रखना इतना जरूरी क्यूँ है । बाप रे एक ओर खाई तो दूसरी ओर भू स्खलन से जगह जगह कटी फटी सड़कें अन्नदाता के ऊपर से बस एक चट्टान खिसकाने की देरी है कि सारी यात्रा का बेड़ा गर्क और अगर इन्द्र का कोप हो तो ऐसी बारिश करा दें कि चट्टान आगे खिसक भी रही हो तो भी गाड़ी की विंडस्क्रीन पर कुछ ना दिखाई दे खैर हम लोग कबी और फेनसांग तक सड़क के हालात देख मन ही मन राम राम जपते गए सामने बैठी एक विदेशी बाला गिरते पानी के प्रवाह से ऐसी मंत्रमुग्ध थी मानों जन्नत में विचरण कर रही हो । फेनसांग से मंगन तक का मार्ग सुगम था इन रास्तों की विशेषता ये है कि एक पहाड़ से दूसरे पहाड़ जाने के लिये पहले आपको एकदम नीचे उतरना पड़ेगा और फिर चढ़ाई चढ़नी पड़ेगी ऐसे में तीस्ता कभी बिलकुल करीब आ जाती तो कभी पहाड़ के शिखर से एक खूबसूरत लकीर की तरह बहती दिखती । हमारे समूह ने सोचा कि छोटे रास्ते से जाने से समय कम लगेगा और ऊँचाई से नयनाभिराम दृश्य दिखेंगे सो अलग । माउंट एवरेस्ट को देख पाने की ललक भी अंदर ही अंदर स्कूली मन में कुलाँचे मार रही थी । ख़ैर एवरेस्ट तो उस रास्ते से नहीं दिखा पर तीखी चढ़ाई चढ़ने की वज़ह से हमारी महिंद्रा की जीप का बाजा बज गया । थोड़ी थोड़ी दूर में इतनी गर्म हो जाती कि उसे अगल बगल से खोज कर पानी पिलाने की आवश्यकता पड़ जाती । येरकाड या यरकौद में यूँ तो होटलों की कमी नहीं है पर बीसवें हेयरपिन बेंड के ठीक बाद में अगर ना भी रुकें तो यहाँ एक बार भोजन करना तो बनता है सिर्फ इसलिए नहीं कि यहाँ के व्यंजन लजीज़ हैं बल्कि खासतौर से इसलिए कि यहाँ के से आप येरकाड घाटी का अद्भुत नज़ारा देख सकते हैं । यहाँ की साज सज्जा तो सुंदर है ही रात के वक्त इन्हीं सीढ़ियों से ऊपर जाकर आप चाँदनी रात में का आनंद भी उठा सकते हैं । की पर लगी इन कुर्सियों पर चाय की चुस्कियाँ लेते हुए येरकाड घाटी के सौंदर्य को घंटों निहार सकते हैं । हरी भरी घाटी .. खाली कुर्सी .. बस उनके साथ की तलबगार है ः । यहाँ खाना पीना उतना मँहगा नहीं पर रहना जेब को काफी भारी पड़ता है । सीजन के हिसाब से यहाँ के कमरे की दरें प्रति दिन पाँच हजार या उससे भी ज़्यादा हो सकती हैं । इसलिए मेरी सलाह तो यही है कि यहाँ रहें ना रहें पर जलपान के लिए रुक कर इन नज़ारों को देखना ना भूलें । पर रास्ते का असली आनंद तब आता है जब आप सात सौ मीटर से ऊपर उठना शुरु करते हैं । इन पौधों को करीब से देखने का सबसे अच्छा उपाय तो ये है कि आप ऊपर तक गाड़ी से जाएँ और फिर बागानों के बीच से ट्रैक करते नीचे उतर आएँ । हरी फलियों से लदी काली मिर्च की लताएँ । गाड़ी से उतर कर हम जंगल में घुसे और इन कच्ची फलियों का स्वाद लिया । खाने में जायक़ा काली मिर्च जैसा ही था पर तीखापन अपेक्षाकृत कम था । अहा क्या स्वाद था इनका भी चाय के सुव्यवस्थित और खूबसूरत बागानों की अपेक्षा कॉफी के पौधे छोटी छोटी झाड़ियों की शक्ल में बेतरतीबी से पहाड़ी ढलानों पर फैले होते हैं । हरे पीले की बीच मन को खुश करता बैंगनी । ढलती रोशनी में ये सूखा से पेड़ ऐसा लग रहा था मानो काग़ज़ पर बनी कोई सुंदर सी पेंटिंग हो । की सीरीज हमेशा से ही अपनी खूबसूरती के लिए जानी जाती रही है । इस की खासियत इसमें इस्तेमाल की गयी टेक्नोलॉजी है । इस के बैकपैनल में खास की पट्टियां लगी हुई है जो स्क्रीन पर चल रही तस्वीर के हिसाब से अपने रंग बदलने की काबिलियत रखती है । आप चाहे तो इस को अपने हिसाब से कस्टमाइज भी कर सकते है । के कारण ये दिखने में बेहद खूबसूरत लगता है । होने पर इसके पीछे से जगमगाती रंग बिरंगी लाइट बेहद खूबसूरत इफेक्ट डालती है । जिससे देखने का मजा ही कुछ और हो जाता है वो और ज्यादा रियलिस्टिक लगने लगता है । इसके साथ ही के कारण ज्यादा देर तक देखते वक्त आंखों पर जोर भी कम पड़ता है । इन सबके अलावा आपके लिविंग रूम की शान तो बढ़ती ही है । माइक्रोमैक्स के इस टेलीविजन का मॉडल स्पोर्ट्स के नाम से है । इसके किनारों को कर्व का डिजाइन दिया गया है । इसके फ्रंट

मिलता है । ये टीवी डिग्री व्यूइंग एंगल दिया गया है । ये टीवी एंड्रॉइड के तीन साल पुराने ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम वर्जन एंड्रॉइड जेलीबीन ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम पर काम करता है । इस टीवी में नॉइस रिडक्शन फीचर और साउंड क्वालिटी सिस्टम है जो यूजर्स को बहुत अच्छी साउंड क्वालिटी देता है । माइक्रोमैक्स टीवी का इंच वाला मॉडल थोड़ा ज्यादा एडवांस फीचर्स के साथ आता है । इसमें पिक्सल का रेजोल्यूशन है और व्यूइंग एंगल भी एक जैसा डिग्री का है । हालांकि ये एंड्रॉइड के एक साल पुराने ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम वर्जन किटकैट पर काम करता है । एडवांस सॉफ्टवेयर देने के साथ ये टीवी पोर्ट देता है । इसके अलावा का स्लिम मेटल बेजल स्क्रीन की साइड बॉडी है । पहले जहां एप्पल का पोर्टेबल वीडियो स्ट्रीमिंग बॉक्स जहां पहले रुपए की रेंज में बिक रहा था अब इस टीवी बॉक्स की कीमत रुपए हो गई है । रुपए कम होने के बाद अब ये टीवी स्ट्रीमिंग बॉक्स ज्यादा अफोर्डेबल हो गया है । एप्पल टीवी एक तरह का डिजिटल मीडिया प्लेयर है । ये दिखने में बहुत छोटा है और इंटरनेट से कनेक्ट होने पर ये डिवाइस टीवी स्क्रीन पर इंटरनेट से वीडियो स्ट्रीम कर सकता है । इंटरनेट की लाइव टीवी और मूवी वेबसाइट्स जैसे नेटफ्लिक्स और आदि की फिल्में टीवी शो और बाकी वीडियोज अपने टीवी पर देखे जा सकते हैं । एप्पल टीवी के जरिए स्ट्रीम किए गए कंटेंट की क्वालिटी बहुत अच्छी होती है । एप्पल टीवी के साथ इसका रिमोट भी आता है । एप्पल टीवी को इस्तेमाल करने के लिए यूजर्स के पास बेहतर इंटरनेट कनेक्शन होना चाहिए । इसी के साथ स्मार्ट टीवी जो क्वालिटी का कंटेंट डिस्प्ले कर सके । एप्पल टीवी में इंटरनेट कनेश्न पोर्ट के साथ एक पोर्ट डिजिटल ऑडियो और वीडियो ट्रांसफर करने के लिए पोर्ट और केबल का इस्तेमाल किया जाता है । स्मार्टफोन्स की आम डाटा केबल में एक साइड होता है और दूसरी तरह है । एक बार सेटअप कर लेने के बाद एप्पल टीवी को इंटरनेट और पोर्ट के जरिए टीवी से कनेक्ट करना होता है । जैसे ही एप्पल टीवी कनेक्ट होगा आपके स्मार्ट टीवी स्क्रीन पर आईट्यून्स स्टोर दिखेगा । इसके बाद आपके टीवी पर वो सभी वीडियोज और मूवीज आएंगी जिन्हें आपने खरीदा होगा । ऑनलाइन फ्री मूवीज भी देखी जा सकेंगी । एप्पल टीवी वैसे तो रिमोट के जरिए ऑपरेट किया जाता है और सीधे इसे टीवी से कनेक्ट किया जाता है पर इससे अन्य काम भी किए जा सकते हैं । एप्पल टीवी को रिमोट की जगह एक ऐप के जरिए आईफोन या आईपैड से भी कंट्रोल किया जा सकता है । इसके जरिए स्पोर्ट्स चैनल का ऑनलाइन कंटेंट भी देखा जा सकता है । एप्पल टीवी और जैसे चैनल का सब्सक्रिप्शन लेने की सुविधा देता है । एप्पल टीवी के जरिए कई ऐप्स भी इंस्टॉल किए जा सकते हैं । एप्पल टीवी के जरिए ऑडियो और वीडियो फाइल फॉर्मेट बदले जा सकते हैं । आईफोन या आईपैड में देखे जाने वाले कंटेंट को टीवी की बड़ी स्क्रीन पर देखा जा सकता है । आईपैड या आईफोन में खेले जा सकने वाले गेम्स भी टीवी पर देखे और खेले जा सकते हैं । यह नया आईमैक है । इसमें मिलियन पिक्सल स्क्रीन है । इसमें पांच या छह एप्लीकेशन साइड बाय साइड रन कर सकते हैं । यह नए तरह का डेस्कटॉप है । जिसमें कोई भी स्क्रीन मिनिमाइज़ नहीं होगी । स्क्रीन बेस पर वेंटिलेशन दी गई है जिससे आईमॅक साउंडलेस रहता है । फिलहाल नया मैक स्पेशलिस्ट सीरीयस फोटोग्राफर और एडिटर को फोकस करेगा । हाई रेजोल्यूशन फोन की तुलना में कम डेंस है लेकिन जितना एक डेस्कटॉप को शॉर्प होना चाहिए उससे ज्यादा शार्प है । इसमें यूएसबी पोर्ट थंडरबोल्ट पोर्ट हेडफोन सॉकेट आदि है लेकिन इसकी कीमत काफी ज्यादा है । गेमिंग का अद्भुत अनुभव है । यह एंड्रॉइड टीवी बॉक्स है । प्लैक्स या एक्सबीएमसी की मदद से इस पर फिल्म का मज़ा उठाया जा सकता है । टीवी स्ट्रीम करना भी आसान है । ग्रिड सपोर्टेड गेम्स में बैटमैन अरखम ऑरिजन्स और स्ट्रीट फाइटर एक्स टेक्कन उपलब्ध हैं । अमेरिकी डॉलर में इसकी कीमत डॉलर यानी करीब रुपए है । यह सैमसंग का नया कर्व्ड थ्रीडी टीवी है । इसका कारण हाई क्वालिटी फिनिश है । किलो वजन वाला यह टीवी नए एसयूएचडी टेक से लैस है जो सबसे एडवांस है । यही इसका सबसे महत्वपूर्ण फीचर भी है । फिलिप्स के इस टीवी का वजन किलो है । स्क्रीन क्वालिटी जबरदस्त है । पिक्चर क्वालिटी को क्लास लीडिंग नहीं कहा जा सकता लेकिन यह अच्छी है । डांसिंग लाइट से डिस्ट्रैक्ट हो रहे हैं तो स्टेटिक पर शिफ्ट कर सकते हैं । कुछ क्लिक से इसे पूरी तरह से बंद भी कर सकते हैं । इससे पहले कि आपका ध्यान स्क्रीन की तरफ जाए किलो वजन वाले इस टीवी का स्टैंड ध्यान अपनी तरफ खींचेगा । इसमें जेस्चर सेंसिंग मैजिक रिमोट और आईपीएस एलईडी पैनल है । एलईडी पैनल के जरिए इंकी ब्लैक को माइक्रो डिमिंग दे सकते हैं । बिल्ट इंच टाइमर रिकॉर्डिंग भी है । ये इंच है । ये पिक्सल रेजोल्यूशन डिस्प्ले क्वालिटी को सपोर्ट करता है । यानी इस पर आपको क्रिस्टल क्वालिटी मिलेगी । कंपनी ने इसकी कीमत रुपए तय की है । कंपनी ने इस टेलीविजन में तीन पोर्ट दिए हैं । वहीं पोर्ट मौजूद है । ड्राइव के जरिए इसमें वीडियो प्ले किए जा सकते हैं । इसके साथ कंपनी ने इसमें तकनीक का इस्तेमाल किया है । जिससे यूजर्स को किसी भी रूम में वर्ग फीट के दायरे में सराउंड साउंड मिलता है । कंपनी ने इस टीवी के डिस्प्ले पर खास काम किया है । ये अल्ट्रा यूजर्स को मिलियन पिक्सल और फुल की मिलियन पिक्सल क्वालिटी देती है । इसके चलते पिक्चर क्वालिटी पूरी तरह क्लियर मिलती है । यानी डिस्प्ले क्वालिटी को देखते हुए इसकी कीमत बेहतर कही जा सकती है । यानी डिग्री एंगल से भी पिक्चर साफ नजर आएगी । ये टीवी ग्राफिक्स इंजन को सपोर्ट करती है । इसमें डिकोडर है । साथ ही वाई फाई नेटवर्क इथरनेट पोर्ट पिक्सल मैपिंग और डिजिटल मीडिया प्लेयर बिल्ड इन है । ये टेबल स्टैंड और वॉल स्टैंड दोनों के साथ आती है । आप यहीं से पुराने लॉगइन सेशंस को हमेशा के लिए हटा भी सकते हैं । ऐसे में कई बार ऐसा होता है कि आपका लॉगइन ओपन ही रह जाता है और कोई भी इसका दुरुपयोग कर सकता । एंड्रॉयड से ऊपर के वर्जन पर करता है काम । कंपनी के मुताबिक एंड्रॉयड के लिए आए पेरिस्कोप में सभी कोर फीचर्स हैं जो यूजर्स द्वारा पसंद किये गए हैं । पेरिस्कोप के एंड्रॉयड वर्जन में कुछ ऎसे यूनिक फीचर्स भी हैं दिए गए हैं जो आईओएस में नहीं दिए गए थे । इसमें मेटेरियल इन्स्पायर्ड डिजाइन है जो एंड्रॉयड यूजर्स को मॉडर्न लगेगा । पेरिस्कोप एप यूजर्स भी अडिशनल पुश नोटिफिकेशन सेटिंग्स अपने हिसाब से सेट कर सकते हैं जैसे फर्स्ट टाइम ब्रॉडकास्ट नोटिफिकेशन्स और शेयर नोटिफिकेशन्स । इसके अलावा इसके दूसरे फीचर्स में बिना ब्रॉडकास्टर के फाइल अपलोड किये भी रिप्पले सेव हो जाते हैं । गूगल प्ले स्टोर पर इस एप को फ्री में अपने मोबाइल में डाउनलोड किया जा सकता है । स्लिक इंटरफेस है । मैसेंजर अब ब्लैकबेरी स्मार्टफोन तक ही सीमित नहीं है । ऑटो करे के दौरान स्टॉक आर्इओएस कीबोर्ड अलग तरह से काम करता है । प्रतिस्पर्धियों पर भारी पड़ने के लिए वॉयस और वीडियो कॉल्स की जरूरत है । यह किसी भी साधन से प्राप्त एक क्रांतिकारी मैंसेंजर नहीं लेकिन मैसेंजर क्लाएंट से भरपूर एक इको सिस्टम में यह सबसे स्लिकेस्ट ऑप्शन्स में से एक है । यह शायद सबसे अच्छी बात है जो उन सभी यूजर्स के साथ हो सकती है जो प्लेटफॉर्म बदलना चाहते हैं लेकिन बीबीएम फ्रेंड्सलिस्ट उन्हें ऐसा करने से रोकती है । चूंकि इसका गोइंग अच्छा था अत मैंने एप्प्ल एप्प स्टोर से बीबीएम को डाउनलोड कर लिया । स्क्रीन के नीचे दिया गया टैब आपको चैट्स कॉन्टैक्ट्स और ग्रुप्स के बीच नेविगेट करने की सुविधा देता है । पूरे एप्प में बायें और दायें हाथ पर स्थित साइड मेन्यू से अधिक से अधिक ऑप्शन्स को एक्सेस किया जा सकता है जिसे सामने खीचा और पीछे ढकेला भी जा सकता है । इसमें बदलाव के लिए कोइ क्विक टोग्गल नहीं है और उसे बदलने के लिए आपको फुल सेटिंग मेन्यू में जाना होगा । इसके टेक्स्ट आधारित चैट का अनुभव ठीक वैसा ही होगा जैसा कि आप आशा करते है चैट शुरू करने का वही तरीका और हर कॉन्टैक्ट के लिए इनडिविजुअल चैट विंडो । दूसरे हर मैसेज एप्प की तरह बीबीएम भी ग्रुप चैट ऑप्शन प्रदान करता है । चैट के अंदर मैसेज डिलीवरी बिल्कुल रियल टाइम है । आपके बीबीएम प्रोफाइल को स्क्रीन के टॉप पर स्थित बार के द्वारा एक्सेस किया जा सकता है जहां कि प्रोफाइल पिक्चर और स्टेटस अपडेट होते हैं । कम्पाइटेबिलिटी आर्इफोन जिस पर और अपने प्रतिस्पर्धियों के मुकाबले ज्यादा चैनल देता है । मैसिव वीडियो लाइब्रेरी है । बोर्ड पर अभी तक कोर्इ स्पोर्ट्स चैनल नहीं है । एयरटेल डिजिटल टीवी डीटीएच ग्राहकों को लाइव टीवी सब्सक्राइव करने का ऑप्शन प्रदान करता है । एयरटेल एप्प पर चैनल देते हैं जो इसके किसी भी प्रतिस्पर्धी के मुकाबले अधिक है । वीडियो को फ्री दिखाता है । दायीं ओर वर्टिकल मेन्यू होता है जिसमें एनी टाइम टीवी कैचअप टीवी ट्रेंडिंग प्रोग्राम्स फ्री वीडियोज और मूवी प्रीव्यू जैसे वैल्यू एडेड फीचर्स की लिस्ट होती है । मौजूदा डिजाइन निस्संदेह उपयोग और प्रेरणा से अधिक है । और चूंकि वह बहुत से यूजर्स के लिए परेशानी का सबब नहीं बनता है अत आप एयरटेल से इसकी उम्मीद कर सकते हैं कि वह एप्प के लिए कुछ अच्छा करे जो आगे एक अच्छा डील हो । आपको बस एक अच्छी स्पीड पर एक वार्इफार्इ या कनेक्शन की जरूरत होती है और स्ट्रीमिंग क्वालिटी भी अच्छी होती है । डिटेक्टेड बैंडविथ के अनुसार क्वालिटी को ऑटोमैटिकली मैनेज किया जाता है । किसी स्मार्टफोन या टैबलेट के मामले में यह स्ट्रीमिंग के लिए जरूरत से ज्यादा की क्वालिटी है । लॉन्च के समय एयरटेल पॉकेट टीवी सर्विस पर चैनल दे रहा है । एयरटेल पॉकेट टीवी सर्विस में अभी तक उसके एप्प पर कोर्इ भी स्पोर्ट्स चैनल उपलब्ध नहीं है और यह उसके लिए खास नुकसान है । टाटा स्कार्इ और डिश टीवी दोनों कुछ खास स्पोर्ट्स चैनल देते हैं । इस प्लेटफॉर्म पर अभी तक एचडी चैनल्स उपलब्ध नहीं हैं । बैंडविथ कॉस्ट को कम करना शायद उसका कारण हो सकता है । यह एक नया हिस्सा है जिसे हम पूर्वाभासी भविष्य के लिए जारी रखना चाहते हैं । एप्प मूलतः आपके शहर के कार्यक्रमों की एक क्यूरेटेड सूची लाता है आपको एप्प के जरिये टिकट बुक करने की सुविधा प्रदान करता है । इस एप की मदद से आप अपने हस्ताक्षर को रजिस्टर कर सकते हैं । इसके बाद आईफोन पर फिंगप्रिंट सेंसर का उपयोग कर इसे डॉक्यूमेंट पर हस्तांतरित किया जा सकता है । इस एप की एक बड़ी खूबी यह है कि इसमें आपको बार बार डिजिटल हस्ताक्षर करने की जरूरत नहीं पड़ती । बस एक बार साइन ईजी एप डाउनलोड करने के बाद आप यह डिजिटल हस्ताक्षर अपने आईफोन पर ड्रॉ करते हैं और बाद में फोन के टच आईडी सेंसर की मदद से कितनी भी बार इसका उपयोग किया जा सकता है । यह एप आपके हस्ताक्षर की एक छोटी पिक्चर आपके चुने हुए डॉक्यूमेंट पर फिक्स कर देती है । इसके बाद डॉक्यूमेंट की साइज के अनुसार हस्ताक्षर की साइज सेट की जा सकती है या जरूरत के अनुसार डॉक्यूमेंट पर इसे फिक्स करने की जगह भी बदली जा सकती है और अपने अनुसार सही जगह लगाया जा सकता है । इसके प्रयोग में बस एक ही परेशानी है वह यह कि हस्ताक्षर किए जाने वाले डॉक्यूमेंट बस आईओएस मेल एप से ही खोले गए होने चाहिए । हालांकि इसमें थर्ड पार्टी एप्लिकेंशंस अटैचमेंट खोलने का ऑप्शन भी है लेकिन साइनईजी एप पर सीधे तौर पर जीमेल से कोई डॉक्यूमेंट खोला नहीं जा सकता । लंबा और घुमावदार हस्ताक्षर करने वालों के लिए भी यहां अपना हस्ताक्षर ड्रॉ करना परेशानी भरा हो सकता है । शानदार ग्राफ़िक्स और कार का सूक्ष्म

चाहता है । रिम ने अपने मैसेंजर एप्प का नया वर्जन उतारा है बीबीएम । हालांकि अभी तक इस सेवा के लिए कोई भी मोबाइल एप्पलीकेशन नहीं है । हालांकि सूचना के मामले में कुछ भी बदला नहीं गया है और यह जीपीएस के द्वारा ट्रेक लोकेशन नहीं है लेकिन यह रेलवे स्टेशन से प्राप्त जानकारी पर आधारित है जिसको ट्रेन ने हाल ही में क्रास किया हो । सॉफ्टवेयर की अग्रणी कंपनी माइक्रोसॉफ्ट ने एंड्रॉयड डिवाइसों के लिए विधिवत रूप से आधिकारिक आउटलुक एप्पलीकेशन को जारी कर दिया है । जाहिर रूप से एंड्रॉयड डिवाइस के यूजर्स जो कि आउटलुक डॉट कॉम . एप्प का इस्तेमाल करते थे इसके पुराने यूजर इंटरफेस और सिंक परेशानियों से बहुत ज्यादा खुश नहीं है । यह निश्चित रूप से कई यूजर्स के बीच स्पैड्रशीट पर तेज और शानदार नियंत्रण की सुविधा देगा । नोकिया मैप्स स्विट को खास तौर से मैप्स ड्राइव पब्लिक ट्रांस्पोर्ट और वेदर एप्स जैसे फीचर से लैस किया गया है । पिछले पांच सालों के दौरान एप्पल आईओएस आपरेटिंग में बेहतर विकास देखने को मिला है । कंपनी के एप्स स्टोर पर आज एक से बढ़कर एक म्यूजिक एप्लिकेशन हैं । हालांकि हम यह जानते हैं कि गूगल मैप्स सूचनाएं बेहतर तरीके से मुहैया कराता है लेकिन हर वक्त जानकारी सही नहीं होती । ऐसे में आप एप्स स्टोर परगेम्स की बात करें तो आज स्मार्टफोन यूजर्स के लिए विभिन्न तरह की शैलियों वाले बहुत से गेम्स मौजूद हैं । अगर आप कोई चीज डाक या कोरियर सेवा से भेज रहे है तो एरिया पिन कोड वैसे ही एसटीडी कोड तथा गाड़ी के रजिस्ट्रेशन नम्बर आदि बहुत महत्वपूर्ण चीजें है लेकिन इस सबके लिए इंटरनेट हमेशा एक बेहतर विकल्प नहीं है क्योंकि अपने देश में फोनीय कनेक्टिविटी हमेशा अपेक्षा पर खरी नहीं उतरती है । यह हलका है । इसमें अनुकूलन का अभाव है । इस एप्लीकेशन की इंस्टॉल का आकार छोटा सा एमबी का है तथा यह यूजर को नम्बर अथवा कोड की सही स्थिति को बताता है । जब कभी भी यूजर सर्च बार में कोई खास नम्बर या कोड पंच करता है उसकी स्थिति जान सकता है । दिलचस्प गेम प्ले है । आसान नियंत्रण है । मल्टीप्लेयर में छोटी स्टोरीलाइन है ।

शौकिया फोटोग्राफी के लिए अच्छे फीचर्स और अच्छी कीमत का कैमरा है । इंटरफेस बहुत पुराने स्टाइल का है । जो अपनी फोटोग्राफी स्किल्स बढ़ाना चहते हैं उनके लिए निकॉन या कैनन के साथ जाना ही अच्छा चुनाव होगा । इसके अलावा पीछे की ओर इंच का एलसीडी डिस्प्ले भी है । हालांकि प्लास्टिक बॉडी होने के बावजूद यह काफी मजबूत दिखता है लेकिन बाजार प्रतियोगिता में निकॉन और यहां तक कि कैनन जो मजबूत भी दिखता है के मुकाबले इसका ग्राम वजन काफी ज्यादा है । एंट्री लेवल का कैमरा होने के बावजूद इसमें वेदर सीलिंग फीचर नहीं है । इसमें बटन्स भी इस कीमत में आने वाले अन्य डीएसएलआर के मुकाबले ज्यादा दिए गए हैं । इस कारण अन्य

अच् पिक् क्लिक कर सकते हैं । वैसे तो दोनों कैमरा अपने आप में अच् हैं लेकिन निकॉन का कूल पिक् पॉकेट फ्रेंडली होने के कारण ज् बेहतर है । साथ ही इसका वेट भी ग्राम है जो कैनन के पॉवर शॉट एसएक् के ग्राम वेट से काफी हल् है । मात्र रूपए में हाथों हाथ फोटो निकालने वाला कैमरा । इन कैमरों की सबसे खास बात ये है कि इनसे फोटो खींचते ही हाथों हाथ उसका प्रिंटआउट निकल आता है । यह बच्चों और लेडीज के लिए शानदार

फीचर्स से लैस है । अब नाम से छोटा सा लेकिन बहुत ही पावरफुल कैमरा आ चुका है जो पहली नजर में आपका मन मोह सकता है । इसके अलावा इसमें वाय फाय के तहत स्मार्टफोन या टेबलेट से भी कनेक्ट करके ऑपरेट किया जा सकता है । बहुत खूबसूरत दिखने वाला यह शानदार कैमरा जल्द ही डॉलर की कीमत के साथ बाजार उपलब्ध होने वाला है । केनन कैमरे में दो लैंस किट दी गई है जिनके चलते यह सुपर्ब रिजल्ट देता है । हालांकी दिखने में यह केनन के अन्य कैमरों की तरह ही लगता है लेकिन इसको कॉम्पेक्ट बॉडी में बनाया गया है । इसमें जूम लैंस के साथ साथ इंच की एलसीडी स्क्रीन दी गई है । इसमें दिया गया ऑटोफोकस बहुत आकर्षक होने के साथ साथ काफी तेज और सब्जेक्ट को रीयल फास्ट लॉक करने में सक्षम है । निकोन अब एक ऎसा फुल फ्रेम डीएसएलआर कैमरा लेकर आ रही है जिससें बहुत ही बढिया क्वालिटी के फोटो खींचने समेत मूवी बनाई जा सकती है । इनकी बदौलर फोटोग्राफर और फिल्ममेकर वेरियड लाइटनिंग कंडीशन में शूटिंग कर सकते हैं । सोनी के इन नए कैमरों की रेंज में सबसे हाई एंड कैमरा है जो वीडियो क्वालिटी वाला है । कंपनी ने इसमें इफेक्टिव मेगापिक्सल सेंसर एमएम फुल फ्रेम एक्समोर सीमॉस सेंसर तथा बियोन्ज इमेज प्रोसेसर के साथ दिया है । इस सरीज का दूसरा कैमरा है जो एडवांस्उ फेज डिटेक्शन ऑटोफोकस तकनीक वाटर रेसिस्टेंट बॉडी से लैस है । कंपनी ने इस कैमरे में

रिंग जूम रिंग इरिस रिंग आदि फ ीचर दिए हैं । दुनिया का पहला ऎसा कैमरा जो खींचता है लाजवाब तस्वीरें । पेनासोनिक ने लॉन्च किया लेमिक्स जीएच शानदार तस्वीरें खींचने के साथ ही वीडियो भी करेगा शूट यह एक हाइब्रिड कैमरा है जिसमें फोटो खींचने के लिए इस्तेमाल किए जाने वाले डिजिटल सिंगल मिररलैस कैमरा डीएमसी तथा वीडियो रिकॉर्डिग करने वाले कैमरे का मिलाजुला रूप है । बहुत शानदार क्वालिटी के फोटो और वीडियो शूट करने वाले इस कैमरे में मेगापिक्सल डिजिटल लाई एमओएस से ंसर दिया गया है । इसके अलवा इसमें ब्रस्ट इंडोर एरिया में बड़ी साइज के फोटो शूट करने के लिए शटर सेकेंड वाइड एंगल लैंस जैसे फीचर्स भी दिए गए हैं । लूमिक्स कैमरे को दो वेरियंट में उपलब्ध कराया है । सुस्पष्ट और विस्तृत इन्टरफेस है । स्पष्ट और झंकारयुक्त साउंड सिग्नेचर है । वोकल ड्रिवेन म्यूजिक के लिए अनुकूल नहीं है । इसका डिटेल स्पष्टता ऑडियो सेपरेशन ये सब इसे खरीदने योग्य बनाते हैं । यह अलग अलग प्रकार के जैसे रॉक मेटल और यहां तक कि इले म्यूजिक के साथ अच्छे से काम करता है । कॉवन के परफॉर्मेंस की सबसे आश्चर्यजनक और मजेदार बात यह है कि यह हेडफोन्स के करीब है जो कि बैंड के मुकाबले अधिक है । उसकी स्पष्टता और डिटेल कुछ ऐसी थी कि उसके लीग को थोड़ा अपडेट करने का वक्त था और तुलना के लिए थोड़े बड़े गन्स लाने की जरूरत थी । लेकिन इस सच्चार्इ के अतिरिक्त कि ये सब उच्च गुणवत्ता वाले थे मैंने यह भी महसूस किया कि साधारण सोर्स इसे कम नहीं कर पायेगा यहां तक कि प्रारंभिक अनजान व्यक्ति की हालांकि हमें प्राप्त समीक्षा यूनिट के पास यह नहीं था । उसके तीन साइज और दो प्रकार थे । यह आपके कान के छेद में अधिक प्रतिरोध या पुश बैक देने के लिए होता है । इसका केबल अधिकतर हिस्सों में फाइबर ब्रेडेड है लेकिन स्टॉपर से जहां लेफ्ट और राइट केबल अलग होती हैं वे बहुत पतली हो जाती हैं । एक हाइब्रिड हेडफोन होने के कारण इसमें दो ड्राइवर्स होते हैं । पहला बैलेंस्ड आर्मेचर ड्राइवर और दूसरा रेगुलर डायनेमिक ड्राइवर । हेडफोन्स ने हमें का ध्यान दिलाया जिसमें दो नहीं बल्कि तीन पृथक् ड्राइवर्स हैं । हालांकि एक फुल रेंज ड्राइवर के मुकाबले अधिक ड्राइवर्स का होना एक फीचर जैसा लगता है जो आज कल कानों में स्पोर्टी प्रतीत होता । विभिन्न सोर्सेज से के बारे में कोशिश करने के बाद एक बात स्पष्ट है कि इसका डिटेल असाधारण है । हालांकि स्पैक्ट्रम का हायर एण्ड किसी तरह बढ़ाया गया है फिर भी कानों में उनकी आवाज मधुर लगती है तीखी नहीं । खास वैसा ही साउंड सिग्नेचर जैसा हमें क्लिप्श में मिलता था । यदि मुझे फ्रीक्वेंसी कर्व का पिक्चर लेना होता तो यह एक क्लोज टू फ्लैट लोअर एण्ड से शुरू होता यू शेप डिप इन द मिड रेंजेज से होकर एक स्टीप सोरिंग हार्इ एण्ड तक जाता । इसका बास जोरदार या धमाकेदार नहीं है लेकिन इस हेडफोन को किसी भी तरह से बासशार्इ के रूप में वर्णित नहीं किया जा सकता है । कई बार यह समझ नहीं आता है खाना बनाने वाला बर्तन सही तरह से गर्म हुआ है या नहीं लेकिन अब बर्तन ही आपको बता देगा की वह खाना बनाने के लिए गर्म होकर तैयार हो चुका है । खाना बनाने के लिए गर्म होकर तैयार हो चुका बर्तन आपके फोन पर मैसेज करेगा कि अब वह गर्म हो चुका है । ऎसे स्मार्ट बर्तनों को जर्मन कंपनी फिसलर ने बनाया है जिन्हें फ्रैंकफर्ट में आयोजित हुए व्यापार मेले में प्रदर्शित किया गया । कंपनी का कहना है कि खाना बनाने के लिए तैयार होकर उसका मैसेज करने वाले इस प्रेशर कूकर में स्मार्टफोन एप का इस्तेमाल किया गया है जो इसके गर्म होने की स्थिति पर नजर रखता है और यूजर के मोबाइल फोन पर मैसेज कर देता है । साथ ही इसमें इंस्टॉल स्मार्ट एप यह भी बताता है कि कब प्रेशर कूकर को जांच की जरूरत है या फिर उसमें कोई खराबी आई है या नहीं । यदि आप शानदार और किफायती मिक्सर ग्राइंडर खरीदने की सोच रहे हैं तो ग्लेन मिक्सर ग्राइंडर जी से बेहतर शायद ही कोई दूसरा हो । ग्लेन मिक्सर ग्राइंडर सबसे बेहतर तथा शानदार इसलिए हैं कि होम एप्लायंस की गुणवत्ता व कार्यक्षमता को जांच कर उन्हें रेटिंग देने वाली संस्था दी राइट च्वॉइस मैग्जीन ने इसें सबसे शानदार बताते हुए फाइव स्टार रेटिंग दिया है । इस साल दी राइट च्वॉइस के जांचकर्ताओं कुलमिलाकर मिक्सर ग्राइंउर के विभिन्न मॉडल्स को परखा ग्लेन मि क्सर ग्राइंडर सबसे शानदार साबित हुआ । इसें डोसा का मसाला मिक्स करने में मात्र सेकेंड का समय लगता है जबकि अन्य यह काम करने में से मिनट का समय लेते हैं । बहुत ही आकर्षक डिजायन वाले ग्लेन मिक्सर ग्राइंडर जी के जार भी स्पेशल ऑयल सील्स से बने है जो इसमें बनने वाले चूर्ण को बाहर नहीं आने देते । ग्लेन मिक्सर ग्राइंडर की कीमत रूपए रखी गई है तथा कंपनी इसके साथ साल की वॉरंटी भी दे रही है । अचानक से आपके घर में किसने प्रवेश किया है इसका पता अब यह स्मार्ट चटाई ही लगाकर आपको बता देगी । इस चटाई के होते हुए घर के दरवाजे आने वाले को देखने के अब आपको जाने बिल्कुल भी जरूरत नहीं पड़ेगी । इस स्मार्ट मैट की सबसे खास बात ये है कि कोई भी इस पर होकर गुजरता है तो उसके बारे में यूजर्स को मैसेज कर बता देती है । यह चटाई उस पर चढ़ने वाले के वजन का अंदाजा लगाकर यूजर को सूचित कर देती है । यह कोई आम चटाई नहीं बल्कि वाय फाय कनेक्टेट सेंसर वाली आधुनिक चटाई है जो कई रेंज में उपलब्ध है । इतना ही नहीं बल्कि इस पर जैसे ही कोई पैर रखता है तो यह आवाज करती है । इतना ही नहीं बल्कि इस स्मार्ट गद्दे सोने के बाद न तो आपको गर्मी लगेगी और ना ही सर्दी । बल्कि इस पर सोने के बाद आपकी बॉडी को जितना और जैसा तापमान चाहिए वो ये देता रहेगा । बलूगा बेड पर आएगी मनचाही नींद सर्दी और गर्मी का अहसास नहीं होने देता है यह बेड । सारा सामान एकसाथ डालना होता है । रोटीयां बनाने वाली यह मशीन असल में एक रोबोट है जो महिलाओं को इस झंझट से मुक्ति दिलाने में सक्षम है । इस मशीन के जरिए रोटियां बनाने के लिए इसमें आटा पानी तथा तेल डालना होता है उसके बाद सारा काम अपनी आप की कर देती है । मोटी पतली कैसी भी बनाएं रोटी । इतना ही नहीं बल्कि यह मशीन इतनी एडवांस है कि यूजर अपनी मर्जी के अनुसार मोटी या पतली रोटियां इससें बनवा सकते हैं । लेकिन इसमें खतरे की बात यह है कि इन स्मार्ट होम एप्लायंस को इंटरनेट के जरिए ऑपरेट किए जाने के कारण इसमें हैकर्स अटैक करके उन्हें नष्ट भी कर सकते हैं । स्मार्ट होम एप्लायंस के बारे में हाल ही में आई एक रिपोर्ट में बताया गया है कि दुनिया में से ज्यादा स्मार्ट डिवाइसेज हैक हुई है । इतना ही नहीं बल्कि हैकर्स स्मार्ट फ्रिज के साथ साथ स्मार्ट टेलीविजन को भी निशाना बना रहे हैं । अब आप अपने घर में रखे फ्रिज कुकर तथा वॉशिंग मशीन से बातें कर सकते हैं । इतना नहीं बल्कि फ्रिज से ये भी पूछ सकते हैं उसमें क्या क्या सामान रखा । जबकि आपके कहते ही वॉशिंग मशीन कपड़े धोने लग जाएगी । कंपनी अपने इन स्मार्ट होम एप्लायंस को फिलहाल दक्षिण कोरिया में ही उपलब्ध करवाया है । एलजी के इस स्मार्ट फ्रिज में कैमरा लगा है जो उसमें रखे सामान पर नजर रखता है । वहीं वॉशिंग मशीन को टेक्सट मैसेज के लिए कपड़े धोने के लिए बोलते ही वह अपना काम शुरू कर देती है । रिमोट की मदद से यूजर्स टाइमर ग्लो लाइट बटन ऑटो स्विंग जैसे फीचर्स का इस्तेमाल कर सकता है । इसमें एंटी डस्ट और सिल्वर नैनो जैसे फीचर्स भी दिए गए हैं । अब बाजार में ऎसा एसी एयर कंडीशनर आ चुका है जो कमरे को ठंड करने के साथ साथ मच्छर भगाने का काम भी करता है । इतना नहीं बल्कि यहां पर कंपनी अपना पहला फाइव स्टार रेटिंग फ्रिज भी लेकर आई है जो जल्द ही बाजार में मिलने लगेगा । यह डोंगल पोर्ट के साथ आ रहा है और यह सीधे आपके टीवी और प्रोजेक्टर से जुड़ सकता है । कम्पनी के मुताबिक यह डिवाइस बहुत कॉम्पैक्ट है और साथ ही यह अपनी पीढ़ी के पुराने डोंगल से फीसदी छोटा है । इसके साथ इसमें डुअल फिल्टर प्रोटेक्शन दिया गया है ताकि यूजर्स को कमरे में सांस लेने में आसानी रहे । इसका इंडोर डायमेंशन चौड़ाई हाइट और गहराई है । फीचर्स वोल्टाज कंपनी का ये विंडो मॉडल है । कंपनी के इस की क्षमता टन है । लैपटॉप में एंटी ग् एचडी लिड स् दी गई है । देखने में इसकी डिज़ाइन ऐवरेज है । क्रोमबुक का इंच मॉडल ब् और व् कलर में मिलेगा जबकि इंच स् मॉडल ग्रे कलर ऑप् में मिलेगा । लैपटॉप जिसकी कीमत भी ज् नहीं है साथ ही इसमें दिए गए फीचर भी आपको पसंद आएंगे । इसके साथ डिवाइस में जीबी की रैम दी गई है जो मेगाहर्ट की स् प्रोवाइड करती है । इसके अलावा लैपटॉप में डॉल् एडवांस ऑडियो तकनीक दी गई है जो साउंड की क् को और बढा देती है । एसर एस् में इंच की ग् लिड बैकलिट स् दी गई है जो रेज् को सपोर्ट करती है । सिंगल माउस बटन साधारण साउंड क् पिछले कुछ समय से बाजार में बढ़ती प्रतिद्वंद्विता के चलते रुपये से कम कीमत के लैपटापों की बाजार में भरमार हो गई है । इसके अलावा गुणा पिक्सल के रिजोल्यूशन के साथ हाइ डेफिनेशन एलईडी डिसप्ले बहुत अच्छा है । फिल्में देखने अथावा वीडियो देखने का अनुभव इस लैपटाप पर काफी अच्छा है । बैटरी कुछ कमजोर होने के कारण कामकाजी लोगों को सफर के दौरान इसका इस्तेमाल करना असुविधाजनक लग सकता है । इंटेल प्रोसेसर अच्छी कार्यक्षमता है । स्क्रीन पिक्सल के एक संकल्प के साथ इंच है । चमकदार सतह बहुत आसानी से गंदे है और लैपटॉप की दिखावट साफ किया था कि उसे इतना उंगलियों के निशान खरोंच आदि आप समय समय पर एक कपड़े से साफ करने के लिए होगा । इकट्ठे लैपटॉप लेनोवो गुणवत्ता और तेजी से लेकिन कवर छोटे भार के तहत शिथिलता के लिए जाता है । लेकिन इस तरह के एक मॉडल के एक घर कंप्यूटर के लिए एक शानदार विकल्प हो सकता है । इसके अलावा वीडियो या साउंड कार्ड के लिए ड्राइवरों की स्थापना के साथ एक समस्या हो सकती है । विभिन्न सुविधाओं वाले इस अल्ट्राबुक को लेनोवो ने रुपये के दाम पर लांच किया है । लेनोवो फ्लैक्स लैपटॉप कंपनी के बजट डिवाइस में से एक है जिसकी इंच की स्क्रीन है । लेनोवो एक मल्टीमीडिया नोटबुक है जिसकी इंच की एचडी डिस्प्ले है । लेनोवो इंच के डिस्प्ले वाले लेनोवो लैपटॉप को आल इनवन डिवाइस माना गया है क्योंकि यह आपके लिए काम के साथ साथ मनोरंजन का साधन बनने में भी सक्षम है । लेनोवो महान मल्टीमीडिया क्षमताओं के साथ एक मॉडल के रूप में श्रृंखला में एक लैपटॉप प्रदान की गई है । स्क्रीन संकल्प × वीडियो कार्ड जी. टी. शक्तिशाली सुविधाओं की है और आप इसे किसी भी खेल खेलने के लिए पर्याप्त होगा की एक आवृत्ति के साथ दोहरी प्रोसेसर । आप फ़ोटोशॉप और वीडियो गेम के शौकीन हैं लेकिन यहाँ आप इसे पछतावा नहीं होगा । ध्वनि बहुत अच्छी गुणवत्ता है । असाधारण और बकाया कुछ भी नहीं मैट फिनिश और छूने के लिए सुखद । इसके साथ ही आसुस ने इस लैपटॉप में बेहतर चार्जिंग सिस्टम भी लगाया है । भारत का यह पहला नोटबुक है जो लेटेस्ट जेनरेशन के इंटेल कोर प्रोसेसर से लैस है । इसमें जेस्च र वॉयस और फेशियल रिक्गनिशन जैसी क्षमताएं भी हैं । ग्राहकों की सुविधा के लिए एसर वन को टैबलेट की तरह इस्तेमाल करने के लिए कंपनी डिवाइस के साथ एक की बोर्ड भी उपलब्ध कर रही है । इसके अलावा एसर वन में एमएएच की बैटरी के साथ इंस्टा गो पॉवर सेविंग फीचर भी डाला गया है जो इसकी बैटरी को जल्दी ड्रेन होने से बचाता है । इंच डिस्प्ले वाले इस लैपटॉप में जीबी का रैम एचडीडी यू प्रोसेसर व जीबी एडीडी है साथ ही इसकी कीमत की शुरूआत रुपये से हुई है । वोस्ट्रो लैपटॉप गुणा पिक्सल रेज्योलूशन के साथ इंच एलइडी स्क्रीन के साथ आया है । इसमें स्टोरेज स्पेस काफी है । मुझे लगा था कि ये सिर्फ मेरे ही कम्प्यूटर में है परंतु नहीं ये समस्या बहुत से हजारों लाखों एचपी / कॉम्पैक नोटबुक / लैपटॉप में है । अभी हाल ही में एक प्रेजेन्टेशन के दौरान मेरा लैपटॉप फिर से उसी समस्या से ग्रस्त हो गया – डिस्प्ले की खराबी । इस तरह की समस्याओं से हजारों खरीदार पहले ही भुगत रहे हैं । एचपी / कॉम्पैक का सर्विस भी बेहद खराब है । क् बैकलिट कीबोर्ड है । गेमिंग लैपटॉप जिनकी प्राथमिकता है उनके लिए यह एक बेहतरीन विकल्प है । दोनों के गेमिंग परफॉरमेंस की तुलना से ये साबित होता है कि का परफॉरमेंस से बेहतर है । यह एनवीडिया जीफ़ोर्स ग्राफ़िक्स की तुलना में दूसरे स्थान पर रहता है लेकिन एएमडी रेडिओन ग्राफ़िक्स वाले नोटबुक्स से इसका स्कोर थोडा बेहतर रहता है । ये उन बहुत से लोगों को आकर्षित करेगा जिनके लिए हल्का लैपटॉप काफी मायने रखता है । यहाँ पर जितने भी लैपटॉप दिए गए हैं उनमे से इसका कीबोर्ड और टचपैड सबसे बेहतर है । इसका परफॉरमेंस काफी अच्छा है लेकिन इसकी बनावट और कीबोर्ड की क्वालिटी ने हमें ज़रूर थोडा निराश किया । लेकिन इसमें लगे एएमडी रेडिओन ग्राफ़िक्स चिप का प्रदर्शन लाज़वाब है । इस कीमत के रेंज में इसका डिस्प्ले इसके सभी प्रतिद्वंदियों से बेहतर है । इसे एक बहुत शक्तिशाली अफोर्डेबल लैपटॉप कहा जा सकता है । एचपी ने एन्वी के ज़्यादातर हिस्सों में मैट फिनिश दिया है जैसा की वो सामान्यतया अपने नोटबुक्स में नहीं करते हैं । लेकिन ये ग्लॉसी एलिमेंट बहुत ज्यादा नहीं है इसलिए इस पर धूल आदि के निशान ज्यादा नहीं दिखते और इसे व्यवस्थित रखना इतना मुश्किल नहीं लगता । एक पावरफुल मशीन का भारी होना बहुत स्वाभाविक है । पूर्व में एचपी पविलियन रेंज फुली लोडेड और उत्कृष्ट परफ़ॉर्मर रहे हैं । कीमत को ध्यान में रखते हुए हम ये कह सकते हैं कि ये वो सर्वोत्तम मशीन है जो आप इस कीमत में खरीद सकते हैं । स्पेसिफिकेशन के आधार पर क्षमता में अपने प्रतियोगियों से काफी आगे और तीव्र मशीन नज़र आती है । इसमें का रैम दिया गया है । लेकिन इसे एक बहुत सक्षम गेमिंग मशीन नहीं कहा जा सकता । स्क्रीन रेसोल्यूशन के मामले यहाँ थोड़ी निराशा हाथ लगती है जो कि पिक्सेल है जबकि इस कीमत के रेंज में पिक्सेल का फुल एचडी स्क्रीन रेसोल्यूशन अपेक्षित था । एन्वी में ब्लू रे ड्राइव नहीं है जबकि लगभग इसी मूल्य के में ये सुविधा उपलब्ध है । सिस्टम परफॉरमेंस टेस्ट पीसी मार्क में एन्वी का स्कोर रहा जबकि का स्कोर है । सारे एप्स बहुत आसानी से खुलते और बंद होते हैं और मल्टीटास्किंग में किसी भी तरह की परेशानी सामने नहीं आती है । चाहे आपको ऑफिस में इस्तेमाल करना हो या घर पर दोनों ही परिस्थितियों के लिए यह एक बेहद सक्षम मशीन है । वैसे तो एन्वी का ग्राफ़िक चिप की तुलना में ज्यादा शक्तिशाली है और कुछ परीक्षणों में इसके अनुरूप एन्वी के बेहतर परिणाम भी सामने आये हैं । दोनों लैपटॉप एक ही फैमिली के लेकिन अलग वर्ज़न का चिप इस्तेमाल करते हैं में जहाँ की चिप है वहीँ में ज्यादा शक्तिशाली का चिप लगा है । एन्वी का डिस्प्ले रेजोल्यूशन के लिहाज़ से हमें थोडा निराश करता है । इस कीमत के रेंज में के इस लैपटॉप में हम हर हाल में फुल एचडी रेजोल्यूशन डिस्प्ले की उम्मीद करते थे । इस बात के अलावा इसकी अन्य विशेषताओं से हम सन्तुष्ट हैं । इस पर लम्बे समय तक टाइपिंग करना बहुत सुविधाजनक है । हम कह सकते हैं कि ग्राफ़िक्स के मामले में एक मध्यम स्तर का एक काफी सक्षम लैपटॉप है जो बहुत से गेम्स को आसानी से चला सकता है । सबसे अहम् बात ये है की डिज़ाइन और लुक्स के मामले में ये लेनोवो से कहीं आगे है । इसे निश्चित रूप से एक बेहतर चुनाव कहा जा सकता है । सैमसंग की नई क्रोमबुक के दोनों मॉडलों में एक् ऑक् चिप लगी हुई है । स्लिम बनावट के साथ शानदार गेमिंग क्षमता इसे एक बेहतरीन लैपटॉप बनाती है । वैसे तो कीबोर्ड में जगह काफी सुनियोजित है लेकिन इसके की पर बना हुआ ढलान इसे इस्तेमाल करने में थोडा मुश्किल कर देता है । इससे स्पेलिंग में गलतियों की सम्भावना बढ़ जाती है और इससे अभ्यस्त होने में थोडा समय लग जाता है । इसकी डिस्प्ले क्वालिटी काफी अच्छी है । टेक्स्ट बहुत अच्छी तरह से दिखाई देते हैं और डिस्प्ले को ज़्यादातर कोणों से देखा जा सकता है । इसका डिस्प्ले बहुत रिफ्लेक्टिव नहीं है जिससे इसे इस्तेमाल करना काफी आरामदेह रहता है । ग्राफ़िक्स बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में लेनोवो आइडियापैड का परफॉरमेंस बेहद शानदार है । इसमें एनवीडिया जीफ़ोर्स ग्राफ़िक्स है और यह परफॉरमेंस में आइडियापैड से काफी आगे है जिसमे एनवीडिया जीफ़ोर्स ग्राफ़िक्स है । बैटरी के परफॉरमेंस टेस्ट में लेनोवो आइडियापैड सबसे आगे रहता है । आइडियापैड का बैटरी परफॉरमेंस अच्छा नहीं है और इसकी बैटरी मिनट तक चलती है । सामान्य इस्तेमाल की दशा में की बैटरी घंटे से भी कुछ ज्यादा तक चल सकती है । लेनोवो आइडियापैड में बहुत सी अच्छी बातों का सम्मिश्रण है अच्छी बनावट स्लिम लुक अच्छा डिस्प्ले बहुत अच्छा परफॉरमेंस शानदार गेमिंग क्षमता और उम्मीद से बेहतर बैटरी लाइफ । लगभग रूपये कीमत में आइडियापैड एक ऐसा लैपटॉप है जिसे आपको अवश्य ध्यान में रखना चाहिए । इस कीमत पर बहुत सी अच्छी विशेषताओं के कारण ये लैपटॉप निश्चित रूप से एक बढ़िया विकल्प साबित होता है । इसका आकार काफी हद तक एक अल्ट्राबुक की तरह कॉम्पैक्ट है । इसमें एक बहुत अच्छा कीबोर्ड भी दिया गया है । यह उनके लिए एक बहुत अच्छा लैपटॉप है जो या तो अपना पहला लैपटॉप खरीद रहे हों या जिनके लिए पोर्टेबिलिटी काफी मायने रखती है । उम्मीद के मुताबिक डिस्प्ले साइज़ के हिसाब से विवोबुक काफी कॉम्पैक्ट है । जैसे ही आप विवोबुक को बॉक्स से निकालेंगे आप आश्चर्य में पड़ जायेंगे की इसकी बनावट कितनी अच्छी है । इसका कवर परंपरागत ब्रश्ड मेटल फिनिश में है जिसे हमने काफी अधिक कीमत वाले आसुस अल्ट्राबुक्स में देखा था । इस लैपटॉप में यह फिनिश देना काफी स्वागतयोग्य है । कवर खोलने पर इसका साफ़ सुथरा कीबोर्ड काफी आकर्षक दिखाई देता है । विवोबुक के टचपैड के आकार ने हमें थोडा आश्चर्य में डाला इसका आकार हमारी उम्मीद से कही ज्यादा बड़ा है । हमने इसे इस्तेमाल करने में काफी आरामदेह पाया । इससे देखने में कुछ असुविधा होती है साथ ही टचस्क्रीन इस्तेमाल करने पर स्क्रीन पर उंगलियों के निशान साफ़ देखे जा सकते हैं और उन्हें साफ़ करने की ज़रूरत होती है । हमें ख़ुशी है कि इस लैपटॉप में रैम पर्याप्त मात्रा में दिया गया है । इसमें बहुत सीमित प्रीलोडेड सॉफ्टवेर दिए गए हैं जिससे मशीन बोझिल नहीं होती । एप्स काफी तेज़ी से खुलते हैं और बहुत सी स्थितियों में इसके खुलने में समय नहीं लगता है । बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में विवोबुक ने मुश्किल स्थितियों में भी बहुत अच्छा प्रदर्शन किया ना तो कोई एप्लीकेशन क्रैश हुआ और ना ही धीमा हुआ जबकि कुछ महंगी मशीनों में भी ऐसा हो जाता है । बैटरी बेंचमार्क टेस्ट में विवोबुक की बैटरी लाइफ मिनट रही । हलांकि इसे बहुत अच्छा नहीं कहा जा सकता लेकिन रोजाना के सामान्य कामकाज की स्थितियों में ये घंटे तक आसानी से चल सकती है जो कि एक अच्छी बात है । इसका पोर्टेबल और कॉम्पैक्ट आकार काफी आकर्षक है । इस चारों क्रोमबुक्स में एक चिकलेट की बोर्ड है और यह इस्तेमाल करने में बहुत ही आसान है । इन चारों क्रोमबुक्स के डिस्प्ले की अगर बात करें तो यह के तो हैं ही साथ ही यह डिस्प्ले हैं जिनमें आपको बढ़िया व्युविंग एंगल्स मिल रहे हैं । हमारे देश में कनेक्टिविटी आज भी एक बड़ी समस्या है वहां इस तरह के डिवाइस कम ही चलते हैं । इसके चलते फिल्म देखने के लिए इंटरनेट से साफ्टवेयर डाउनलोड करना होगा । इसकी स्क्रीन इंच की है और कैमरा भी अपेक्षाकृत काफी कमजोर है केवल मेगापिक्सल का । लेकिन ग्राफिक्स की क्वालिटी काफी अच्छी है । इस लैपटाप की बैटरी सेल की है और लगभग घंटे चलती है । लैपटाप में मेगापिक्सल का वेबकैम है और इन वन कार्ड स्लाट भी । इसलिए अगर चाहें तो से हजार रुपये के बीच मौजूद विकल्पों को भी तलाश लें क्योंकि अंत में जाकर इतनी ही लागत आपको इस लैपटाप की आएगी । यह हाल ही में लान्च हुए गूगल क्रोमबुक लेपटॉप्स का डेस्कटॉप वर्जन है जो विशेषतौर पर बिजनेसमेन्स के लिए बनाया गया है । यह कंप्यूटर गूगल के क्रोम ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम पर काम करता है । यह कंप्यूटर फुल वीडियो कॉन्फ्रेंस सॉल्युशन के साथ साथ फुल एचडी वीडियो कैमरा कंबाइंड माइक्रोफोन स्पीकर्स तथा रिमोट कंट्रोल के साथ अया है । कंप्यूटर�आप वायरलैस तकनीक क तहत महज एक क्लिक से कॉन्फ्रेंस करने समेत तथा डॉक्यूमेंट्स शेयर कर सकते हैं । एस्युस ने इस पीसी को वीयाओ सीरीज के तहत उतारा है । चौंकाने वाली कीमत के आए इस कंप्यूटर का नाम और फीचर्स भी चौंकाने वाले हैं । दुनिया के सबसे सस्ते कंप्यूटर में ब्लूटूथ वाय फाय जैसे सबकुछ फीचर्स है । इसमें गीगहर्त्ज प्रोसेसर एमबी रैम तथा इंटरनल स्टोरेज है । डेव बोर्ड जैसे दिखने वाले चिप कंप्यूटर पर फुल लाइनक्स डेस्कटॉप रन किया जा सकता है । इस में ऑलविनर एसओसी का इस्तेमाल किया गया है जो सस्ता होने के साथ साथ पावरफुल भी है । इस कंप्यूटर को डॉलर खर्च करके एक हैंडहेल्ड कंप्यूटर सिस्टम में बदला जा सकता है । सस्ती कीमत वाले गूगल क्रोमबुक लेपटॉप्स की जबरदस्त लोकप्रियता और बढ़ती मांग से माइक्रोसॉफ्ट के लेपटॉप्स की बिक्री में कमी आई है । हालांकि इस प्रोसेसर के चलते यह ज्यादा फास्ट नहीं होगा लेकिन पर्सनल यूज के लिए बेहतर माना जा रहा है । यह दिखने में काफी आकर्षक लगता है । डेल ने भारत में दो नए ऎसे दमदार नोटबुक लॉन्च किए हैं जो शानदार परफोर्मेश वाले हैं । ये दोनों ही लेपटॉप रगेड हैं जिसके चलते इन्हें बहुत खराब हालात या माहौल में भी इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है । रगेड परफोर्मेश वाले होने के साथ डेल के इन लैटिटयूड लेपटॉप्स में की स्क्रीन को फि्लप अपनी सहूलियत के अनुसार सेट किया जा सकता है । इन कै मरों से आसानी से चैटिंग और दूसरे प्रोग्राम शूट किए जा सकते हैं । लेपटॉप और टेबलेट दोनों एकसाथ की लेने की इच्छा रखने वालों के लिए यह सबसे अच्छा मौका है । इसमें इंच की एक्सडब्लूवीजीए मल्टी टच आईपीएस डिस्पले स्क्रीन जीरो एयर गेप तकनीक के साथ दी गई है । अगर आप रूपये के आस पास का लैपटॉप चाहते हैं तो लेनोवो आइडियापैड आपके लिए एक बेहतरीन विकल्प हो सकता है । बैटरी के परफॉरमेंस टेस्ट में लेनोवो आइडियापैड सबसे आगे रहता है और इसका क्षमता मिनट है । इसका टचपैड भी काफी बड़ा है । आमतौर पर से छोटे डिस्प्ले साइज़ वाले लैपटॉप्स में कीबोर्ड की क्वालिटी बहुत अच्छी नहीं होती । थोड़े छोटे ज़रूर हैं लेकिन इतने छोटे नहीं हैं की इनसे कोई परेशानी हो । इसका स्क्रीन रेजोल्यूशन है जोकि इस कीमत में सामान्यतया होता है । इसमें एसएसडी नहीं है लेकिन इसमें का हार्ड ड्राइव दिया गया है । इसमें विंडोज ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम है लेकिन अच्छी बात ये है कि इसमें बहुत सीमित प्रीलोडेड सॉफ्टवेर दिए गए हैं जिससे मशीन बोझिल नहीं होती । विवोबुक में कोर प्रोसेसर होने की वज़ह से हम इससे कोई बहुत तेज़ परफॉरमेंस की उम्मीद नहीं करते थे । इसका बूट टाइम अच्छा है और ये कोर वर्ज़न वाले एचपी पविलियन के स्तर का है । ऑफिस में इस्तेमाल की स्थिति में हमने इस पर क्रोम ब्राउज़र के बहुत से टैब्स खोले और कई माइक्रोसॉफ्ट वर्ड डॉक्यूमेंट और एक्सेल स्प्रेडशीट्स के साथ बैकग्राउंड में आइट्यून्स को भी चलाया लेकिन हमें इसके परफॉरमेंस में कोई कमी नहीं दिखाई दिया । विवोबुक की कीमत के रेंज में आपको और के बहुत से लैपटॉप मिल सकते हैं लेकिन अगर आपकी प्राथमिकता एक अच्छी बनावट वाला पोर्टेबल लैपटॉप है तो एक बेहतरीन विकल्प है । साथ ही यह डिस्प्ले हैं जिनमें आपको बढ़िया व्युविंग एंगल्स मिल रहे हैं । यह काफी मज़बूत और भारी है । कंपनी की ओर से इन दोनों की वेरियंट्स के लिए साल की वॉरंटी दी जा रही है । फुल डेस्कटॉप रन किया जा सकता है । इस कंप्यूटर में पावर सोर्स लगाकर डिस्प्ले के लिए विडियो केबल लगाय जा सकता है । चिप कंप्यूटर की कीमत इतनी सस्ती होने के पीछे का कारण इसमें लगा सस्ता चाइनीज कोर है जो एक टेबलेट से लिया गया है । चिप कंप्यूटर रास्पबेरी से भी सस्ता है । यह अब तक का सबसे पतला मैकबुक है । इसमें इंच की रेटिना डिस्पले स्क्रीन लगी है । कंपनी ने इसमें जीबी फ्लैश स्टोरेज और इंटेल एचडी ग्राफिक्स दिए हैं । इन नोटबुक्स को ऑयल और माइनिंग साइट्स पर तापमान बहुत अधिक होता है और मिलिट्री सर्विस के लिए सियाचिन लद्दाख में तापमान बहुत कम पाया जाता है वहां भी बहुत ही आसानी से इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है । डेल का इन वारटप्रूफ रगेड डिग्री तथा डिग्री तापमान में भी देते हैं शानदार परफार्मेस । इनके चलते इसे टेबलेट के रूप में काम में लेते हुए फोटो वीडियो शूटिंग के लिए वीडियो चैटिंग करने के अलावा सेल्फी खींची जा सकती है । एचपी के हाई एंड लैपटॉप्स हमेशा बहुत अच्छे होते हैं । आइडियापैड की परफॉरमेंस शानदार है और एन्वी इसके काफी करीब रहता है । एक बार ऐसा कर लेने के बाद एन्वी का शानदार परफॉरमेंस आपको खुश कर देगा । सबसे अहम् बात ये है की डिज़ाइन और लुक्स के मामले में ये लेनोवो से कहीं आगे है इसे निश्चित रूप से एक बेहतर चुनाव कहा जा सकता है । इसके अलावा जीमेल और गूगल ड्राइव ऑफलाइन इस्तेमाल भी किया जा सकता है । इस लैपटॉप की बैटरी घंटे तक सिंगल चार्ज में काम कर सकती है । इस डिवाइस में इंटेल का नया कोर प्रोसेसर दिया गया है । कंपनी ने इस डिवाइस की बैटरी भी दमदार दी है । इसे नया शेप दिया गया है जो ठोस एल्युमिनियम का है । आसुस की इस अल्ट्राबुक में फुल साइज कीबोर्ड दिया गया है । एप्पल के नए इंच लैपटॉप में इंटरनल मेमोरी के साथ का क्वाड कोर इंटेल कोर प्रोसेसर दिया गया है । पुराना वर्जन डुअल बूट ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम के साथ आता था । कीबोर्ड में ट्रैकपैड छोटा है । विंडोज ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम पर काम करने वाला ये टैबलेट इंटरनल मेमोरी के साथ आता है । इलाइटबुक के अल्ट्रा स्लिम डिजाइन की बात है तो ये एप्पल की मैकबुक एयर की तरह है । इलाइटबुक हर तरह के यूजर्स के लिए शानदार डिवाइस है । इस डिवाइस में पावर कीबोर्ड दिया गया है । साथ ही माइक्रो सिम माइक्रो कार्ड और स्मार्ट कार्ड रीडर का स्लॉट मौजूद है । यह स्कूल में या बिजनेस कॉन्फ्रेंस जेसे कामों में काफी यूजफुल हो सकता है । ये आपके सिस्टम का डाटा और एनर्जी दोनों ही सेव करता है । सूचना प्रौद्योगिकी कंपनी एसर ने दुनिया का सबसे पतला लैपटॉप पेश किया है । इस लैपटॉप का स्क्रीन सेमी है और वजन किलोग्राम तीन पाउंड से भी कम है । नए लैपटॉप में पॉवरफुल प्रोसेसर ग्राफिक सपोर्ट और सुपीरियर क् का ऑडियो सपोर्ट दिया गया है । विंडो ओएस पर रन करने वाले नए आईडिया पैड सीरीज लैपटॉप का भार किलो है । ये फ़ोन एलटीई रेडी है और इसे ख़ूबसूरती से डिज़ाइन किया गया है । इस नए फ़ोन का ब्राउज़र गुना ज़्यादा फ़ास्ट है । अगर इसका सिर्फ डिजाइन देखा जाए तो यह ऐसा फोन नहीं है जिसके लिए लोगों की लाइन लग जाएगी । यह थोड़ा स्लो चलता लग रहा है । एंड्रॉयड का ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम दिया गया है । इसकी इंच वाली की स्क्रीन आपको भाएगी । इसका मेगापिक्सल का फ्रंट कैमरा भी काफी अच्छा है । रेडमी नोट हमें पसंद आया । प्राइस टैग तो जबरदस्त है ही । वैसे इस साल लॉन्चेस होने हैं और अगर आप लॉन्ग टर्म को ध्यान में रखकर फोन लेना चाहें तो ले सकते हैं । फोन में बढ़िया डिस्प्ले है । इसका एंड्रॉयड फंक्शन भी अच्छा है तो इस फोन को हम मस्ट बाय का टैग देंगे । हां इसमें ड्यूल सिम फंक्शनैलिटी न होना कइयों को निराश कर सकता है । यूरेका के साइज लुक और इसकी खूबियों की बात करें तो ये काफी हद तक श्याओमी से मिलती जुलती हैं । वैसे यू यूरेका न तो कुछ ज्यादा ही स्लिम है और न ही वजन के मामले में काफी हल्का है । इसकी संरचनात्मक खूबसूरती आपको माइक्रोमैक्स के अन्य फोन्स के मुकाबले भाएगी । इसके चारों ओर के किनारे को थोड़ा उठा हुआ बनाया गया है ताकि किसी भी तरह की स्क्रैच से बचा जा सके । साइज में दिए गए पावर और वॉल्यूम बटन्स आराम से ऑपरेट हो जाते हैं । बैटन नामक एक ऐप भी इसमें दिया गया है जिसके बारे में दावा किया गया है कि यह आपकी चुनी हुई ऐप्स को क्लाउडीफाई कर देगी हालांकि जब हमने इसका इस्तेमाल किया तो यह बिल्कुल काम नहीं किया । दिन प्रतिदिन के इस्तेमाल में यह फोन एकदम बढ़िया है । वैसे हमने जब इसे यूज किया तब हम इसमें अपनी एमकेवी सैंपल क्लिप नहीं प्ले करवा पाए हालांकि बाकी फाइल फॉर्मेट्स को सिस्टम सपोर्ट कर रहा था । बता दें कि इसका हैडसेट सुविधाजनक नहीं लगता हालांकि फोन कॉल सुनने में तो इसका इस्तेमाल कर ही सकते हैं । कॉल क्वॉलिटी संतोषजनक है और इसमें हमें कोई शिकायत नहीं लगी । बैटरी की बात करें तो हमने इसे विडियो लूप टेस्ट पर डाला और यह घंटे मिनट तक चला । हमारे मुताबिक इसका कैमरा एकदम बढ़िया निकला इससे ली गई तस्वीरों की इमेजेस बेहतरीन थीं । हमने जो क्लोज अप तस्वीरें लीं वे जबरदस्त निकलीं और दिन की रोशनी में ली गई तस्वीरें इतनी शार्प थीं कि फोकस पॉइंट पर यदि आप किसी डेस्कटॉप से परसेंट जूम भी करके भी देखें तो वे लाजवाब लगेंगी । फोन ने ऑटो फोकस होने में कुछ ज्यादा ही वक्त लिया । फ्लैश ने ऐसे मौकों पर ठीकठाक काम किया । वैसे यूरेका की छोटी बड़ी कमियों के आराम से नजरअंदाज किया जा सकता है । सबसे अच्छी बात इस फोन के संदर्भ यह रहेगी कि रेडमी नोट का वर्जन इससे हजार रुपए महंगा है और इसका होते हुए अपेक्षाकृत सस्ता होने की वजह से लोग इसकी ओर मुढ़ेंगे । शानदार परफार्मेंस है बहुत अच्छी बैटरी लाइफ है पकड़ने में अच्छा है । सोनी की एक और अच्छी रचना जो कि मात्र देखने योग्य ही नहीं है । अच्छी बैटरी लाइफ एप्पलीकेशन का बेहतरीन संग्रह है अौर बेहतरीन टच स्क्रीन भी है । गेमिंग स्वीकार करने योग्य नहीं है कैमरा भी अच्छा नहीं है अौर पॉवर बटन का स्थान त्रुटिपूर्ण है । फोन में अच्छा मल्टीमिडिया पुश मेल सेवा दोहरे मेमोरी कार्ड स्लॉट तथा इंची कैपेसिटिव टच स्क्रीन के साथ साथ फीचर्स का पूरा जखीरा लगा है । फोन की कीमत रुपये है जो इसे खरीदेगा उसे तीन महीने के लिए मुफ्त में असीमित डेटा उपयोग तथा असीमित एमटीएस से एमटीएस कॉल की सुविधा मिलेगी । एक्सपेरिया सोला एंड्रॉयड स्मार्टफोन कीमत के लिहाज से रोमांचकारी और खास बात यह है कि इसमें फ्लोटिंग टच स्क्रीन डिसप्ले दिया गया है । नोकिया प्योरव्यू एक ऐसा कैमरा फोन है जिसमें है विस्मयकारी फोटो देने की क्षमता लंबी बैटरी लाइफ और शानदार ऑडियो प्लेबैक के साथ रिकार्डिंग का अनुभव । कम रेजोल्यूशन डिसप्ले महंगा होना अौर रतिस्पर्धियों की तुलना में धीमा इसकी कमियां हैं । नोकिया प्योरव्यू कैमरा प्रधान नोकिया एन का सच्चा उत्तराधिकारी है और यह इस से एक लंबी छलांग भी है । नोकिया में लांच होने के बाद से अपने मेगापिक्सल के इमेजिंग सेंसर के बल पर कैमरा फोन सेगमेंट पर राज कर रहा है । इसमें दो कमियां हैं जिन पर पहले से ही ध्यान देना चाहिए सिम्बियन आधारित बेले मोबाइल ओएस और मोटाई के साथ भारी होना । स्क्रीन की टच और इमेज क्वालिटी अच्छी है बटेरी डेढ़ दिन तक चलता है पर्फोर्मांस भी बहुत अच्छा है पकड़ने में भी आसान है । एचटीसी वन सीरीज खास तौर से बेहतर फोटोग्राफी और शानदार म्यूजिक क्षमता के लिए जाना जाता है । इसे जेनफोन नाम से लाया गया है जिसमें जीबी रैम लगी है यह और एंड्रॉयड के लेटेस्ट वर्जन लॉलीपॉप पर काम करता है । इसके अलावा इसमें आगे और पीछे की तरफ जबरदस्त कैमरे और अंदर बड़ी बैटरी दिए गए हैं । इस स्मार्टफोन की सबसे खास बात ये है कि कम कीमत होने के बावजूद इसमें जबरदस्त फीचर्स दिए गए हैं । जबरदस्त प्रोसेसर से लैस इस स्मार्टफोन में मेगापिक्सल कैमरा पीछे की तरफ दिया गया है और इसमें आगे की तरफ भी सेल्फी कैमरा दिया गया है । इनफोकस अपने सेगमेंट में बहुत ही अच्छी परफोर्मेश वाला है । इसी प्राइस में आप लावा आइरिस प्रो भी देख सकते हैं जिसमें यही स्पेसिफिकेशंस हैं लेकिन ओवरऑल लुक के मामले में बेहतर है । क्वॉलिटी के लिहाज से देखें तो माइक्रोमैक्स ने एक बहुत अच्छा स्मार्टफोन बनाया है । साइज़ की वजह से नहीं बल्कि डिजाइन की वजह से यूनाइट को हाथ में पकड़े रखना तुलनात्मक रूप से थोड़ा मुश्किल है । कलर रीप्रडक्शन अच्छा है और कंट्रास्ट लेवल भी बढ़िया है और किनारों से स्क्रीन देखने पर भी रंग कमोबेश ठीक दिखते हैं । कई भारी ऐप्स एक साथ चलाने पर यह थोड़ा अटकने लगता है लेकिन ज्यादातर यूज़र्स को इसे इस्तेमाल करते हुए कोई खास दिक्कत नहीं होगी । आप इस पर सभी विडियो फॉर्मैट चला सकते हैं यहां तक कि विडियो भी अच्छे चलते हैं । लेकिन इसे विडियोज़ के साथ दिक्कत होती है जो स्वाभाविक है । यूनाइट से हमने जो तस्वीरें लीं वे इस कीमत के स्मार्टफोन के हिसाब से बहुत अच्छी थीं । इसका स्क्रीन इतना कमजोर होता है की मेरे हाथ के हल्का दबने से ही मेरे टॅब का अल सी डी टूट गया । सेर्विसिंग बहुत खराब है । इसके बैक पैनल की मैट फिनिश अच्छी ग्रिप देती है । इसका पांच इंच का फुल एचडी डिस्प्ले शानदार व्यूइंग ऐंगल के साथ चटख रंग देता है । इसके ज्यादातर फंक्शंस की परफॉर्मेंस दमदार है । मल्टिटास्किंग और प्री लोडेड आईफ्लोट ऐप के जरिए एक साथ कई विंडो में ऐप्स चलाने से यह स्लो नहीं होता । हमें इसमें सिर्फ एक चीज पसंद नहीं आई वह यह कि इसकी बैटरी सिर्फ की है । इसमें व्यूइंग ऐंगल्स अच्छे हैं लेकिन रंग थोड़े फीके लगते हैं । मेगापिक्सल्स के कैमरे का इंटरफेस थोड़ा धीमा है और फोकस करने में वक्त लगाता है हालांकि फोकस करने के बाद यह अच्छे रिजल्ट्स देता है । मेगापिक्सल का कैमरा क्लियर है लेकिन कैमरा एप बुरी तरह से अटक रहा था जब के वीडियों को कैप्चर कर रहे थे । अधिकतर यूजर्स के लिए गेमिंग मूवीज देखने और पढ़ने के लिए अच्छा है पर सूर्य की रोशनी में काफी कठिनाइयां आएंगी । कुलमिलाकर यह एक काफी अच्छा फोन है जो लगातार अच्छा परफॉर्म करता है और बिना किसी लैग या रुकावट के चलता है । कैमरे का सबसे रोचक फीचर ऑप्टिकल इमेज स्टेबलाइजेशन है जो कि शानदार क्वालिटी के एचडी विडियो को रिकार्ड करने की सुविधा देता है । लूमिया में जीबी का ऑनबोर्ड स्टोरेज है और इसे माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड के जरिए जीबी तक बढ़ाया जा सकता है । इस स्मार्टफोन में कार्ल जीस लेंस और डुअल एलइडी फ्लैश के साथ मेगापिक्सल का कैमरा है । लिनोवो का सेल् कैमरा मेगापिक् का है जिसमें फिक् फोकस भी दिया गया है । इसमें मैन कैमरा मेगापिक् का लगा हुआ है जिसमें सीन डिटेक् फेस रिकॉग् लो लाइट इनहेंसमेंट पैनोरमा जियो टैगिंग बस् शॉट स् शॉट और एचडीआर जैसे ऑप् दिए गए हैं । बैटरी एस में एमएएच बैटरी दी गई है जो में घंटे का टॉक टाइम और घंटे का स् टाइम देती है । इसके साथ कुछ शानदार ऑफर भी मिल रहे हें । लूमिया के साथ एयरटेल सिम में महिनों तक डबल डेटा भी मिलेगा यानी इन ऑफरों को देखकर आप ये कह सकते हैं आम के आम गुठलियों के भी दाम । हालाकि इसमें दो स् की खूबी दी गई थी जिसमें साधारण स् की तरह एक स् दी गई थी और दूसरी तरफ इंकजेट स् दी गई थी जैसे ईबुक रीडर में आपको मिलती है । इस स् की खास बात है अगर आप किताबें पढ़नें के शौकीन है तो फोन में देर तक ढेरों ईबुक पढ़ सकते हैं । इसके फीचरों पर नजर डालें तो योटाफोन में जैलीबीन ओएस दिया गया है साथ में गीगाहर्ट ड्युल कोर प्रोसेसर जीबी रैम एमएएच बैटरी और मेगापिक् का मेन कैमरा दिया गया है । इन सबके अलावा फोन में की इंटरनल मैमोरी जीबी है जिसे माइक्रोएसडी कार्ड स् की मदद से जीबी तक एक् कर सकते हैं । यह हाई क्वालिटी के पॉलिकार्बोनेट से बना है जो इस कीमत में बहुत बड़ी बात है । मल्टी कलर्ड वैरिएंट निश्चित रूप से अपना प्रभाव छोड़ते हैं पर मैट फीनिश और मटीरियल जो इसे बनाने में प्रयोग किया गया है वो लुक और फील में इसे हाइ एंड लूमिया डिवाइस के करीब रख देता है । एमएम पतले इस हैंडसेट का कुल वजन ग्राम है । एमआई आई में डिस्प्ले स्क्रीन इंच फुल एचडी है । यह विभिन्न रंगों में उपलब्ध है । जियाओमी एमआई एमआईयूआई के साथ एंड्रायड पर चलता है । एमआई में गीगाहर्ट्ज स्नैपड्रैगन ऑक्टाकोर बिट प्रोसेसर और जीबी रैम है इसी कारण मल्टीटास्किंग में यह हैंग नहीं होता । इसके अन्दर लगी एमएएच की बैटरी पूरे डेढ़ दिन तक चलती है । एकदम बायीं ओर लेफ्ट में दिए गए बटन अपने आप डिफॉल्ट एप्स को दिखाते हैं । जियाओमी एमआइ में मेगापिक्सल का रियर कैमरा है जो आउटडोर में बहुत अच्छी पिक्चर्स कैप्चर करता है । अच्छी सेल्फी के साथ साथ वीडियो कॉलिंग भी की जा सकती है । अंधेरे में कैमरे के साथ थोड़ी परेशानी आती है यह थोड़ा कमजोर पड़ जाता है । डुअल टोन एलइडी फ्लैश अच्छा काम करती है सब्जेक्ट पर लाइटनिंग करके । डिस्प्ले में ऑटो ब्राइटनेस सेट की गई है और फोन डाटा कनेक्शन पर भी सम्मोहित करता है जब ऑटोमेटिक एप अपडेट्स को डिसेबल कर देता है । सफेद व ब्लू रंग में उपलब्ध प्लास्टिक बैक क्वालिटी फीलिंग देता है हालांकि मेटल या लकड़ी जितनी बढिय़ा नहीं है । गूगल ने इस स्मार्टफोन में बेहतर ऑडियो के लिए फ्रंट पैनल में दो स्पीकर दिए हैं । एमआइ जियाओमी अपने आप में एक अन्य विजेता डिवाइस है । इस फोन में स्टनिंग स्क्रीन के साथ ग्रेट बिल्ट क्वालिटी उपलब्ध है । ग्राम के वजन वाले इस फोन की माप गुणा गुणा मिमी है । मैट फिनिश वाले बैक पैनल के साथ दायीं तरफ पावर बटन है व रियर पैनल के पास सिम व माइक्रोएसडी कार्ड स्लॉट है । फ्यूल डिस्प्ले के पास कार्निंग गोरिल्ला ग्लास प्रोटेक्शन है । एक घंटे के विडियो प्लेबैक पर प्रतिशत बैटरी खपत होती है और गेम्स खेलने के दौरान भी लगभग इतना ही खपत है अर्थात नार्मल ब्राइटनेस के साथ चार घंटे तक यूट्यूब वीडियो का आनंद भी लिया जा सकता है । लावा के आयरिस फ्यूल स्मार्टफोन की खासियत इसकी दमदार बैटरी लाइफ है । इस फोन में एचआरडी स्क्रीन एलइडी फ्लैश के साथ मेगापिक्सल रियर और मेगापिक्सल फ्रंट कैमरा दिया गया है । परफार्मेंस की बात करें तो अपने टक्कर वाले हैंडसेट्स के मुकाबले यह बढि़या है इसलिए यदि आप लंबे बैटरी लाइफ वाले स्मार्टफोन की खोज में हैं तो आयरिस फ्यूल आपके लिए बेहतर ऑप्शन है । इसके अलावा इसमें सुपर चार्ज फीचर दिया गया है जिसके तहत इसकी बैटरी मात्र मिनट की चार्जिंग में घंटे तक चलती है । इसमें एमएएच की बैटरी लगी है फुल चार्ज होने में घंटे लगेंगे । सोनी के छोटे कंपैक्ट डिवाइस के सिंगल चार्ज पर तीन दिन या नोट की दो दिन की बैटरी लाइफ की तुलना में यह कमजोर है पर नेक्सस से बेहतर है । नेक्सस गूगल के नये एंड्रायड लॉलीपॉप पर चलने वाला पहला स्मार्टफोन है । जब स्क्रीन ऑफ होता है तो नोटिफिकेशन काफी मंद डिस्प्ले में आता है । इंच के स्क्रीन को इंजीनियरिंग का बेहतर परफार्मेंस कह सकते हैं । स्मार्टफोन या टैबलेट के लिए यह एक बेहतर स्क्रीन है । चाहे मूवी हो वीडियो हो या फिर कोई गेम हर चीज में इसका वाइब्रेंट कलर बेहतर स्क्रीन का अनुभव देता है । गुणा पिक्सल का रेजोल्यूशन नोट के स्क्रीन को और शार्प बनाता है । नोट में क्वालकॉम स्नैपड्रगन प्रोसेसर व जीबी के रैम के साथ तेज ग्राफिक्स प्रोसेसर है । पर जेनरल पफार्मेंस बेहतर है इसमें एसफाल्ट जैसे गेम बेहतर तरीके से खेला जा सकता है । इसमें जीबी का इंटर्नल स्टोरेज है व माइक्रोएसडी कार्ड का सपोर्ट भी है । हम इस फोन को कनेक्शन के साथ उपयोग कर सकते हैं साथ ही इसमें का सपोर्ट भी है । नोट की बैटरी लाइफ काफी अच्छी है । इसमें एमएएच की बैटरी लगी है । जेनफोन काफी सिम्पल है लेकिन इसके बावजूद भी आप डिवाइस से ऊबेंगे नहीं क्योंकि आप बारी बारी से इसके बैक कवर को बदलकर इसकी लुक बदल सकते हैं । बॉडी की बात करें तो कंपनी ने प्लास्टिक का उपयोग ज्यादा किया है । इसकी बॉडी में इतनी क्षमता है कि यह गिरने पर कुछ हद तक चोटें सह सकता है जिससे डिवाइस को अंदरूनी दिक्कत नहीं आएगी । डिवाइस में पोर्ट व बटन भी ठीक आकार में लगाए गए हैं । कुल मात्रा में बात करें तो डिवाइस देखने में अच्छा है लेकिन काफी साधारण डिजाइन है । आसुस जेनफोन में मेगापिक्सल रियर व मेगापिक्सल फ्रंट कैमरा है । जेनफोन एक डुअल सिम डिवाइस है जिसमें व दोनों नेटवर्क चलते हैं । इसके अलावा वाइ फाइ एन ब्लूटूथ जीपीएस ग्लोनैस जैसे कनेक्टिविटी ऑप्शन मौजूद हैं । डिवाइस में कुछ एप्स जैसे कि टास्क फ्लैशलाइट व एक ओमलेट एप्लीकेशन होगी जिसके जरिए आप अपने दोस्तों के बीच तस्वीरें शेयर कर सकेंगे । डिवाइस का म्यूजिक प्लेयर खोलते ही आपको कुछ अलग डिजाइन व ग्राफिक्स देखने को मिलेंगे । यदि ऑडियो सिस्टम की बात करें तो आवाज काफी अच्छी है साथ ही लाउडस्पीकर पर भी म्यूजिक सुनने का अनुभव अच्छा है । इंच के फुल एचडी आईपीएस डिस्प्ले वाले वैम्मी नियो में गीगा हर्ट्ज मीडियाटेक ऑक्टा कोर प्रोसेसर है जीपीयू एंड्रायड जीबी रैम मौजूद है । यह सभी गुण डिवाइस को उम्मीद से अच्छी कार्यक्षमता प्रदान करते हैं । वैम्मी नियो काफी पतला डिवाइस है और वजन के मामले में इसने मोटो जी को भी पीछे छोड़ा है । डिवाइस की दायीं ओर पावर बटन है और बायीं ओर वॉल्यूम बटन । इसके साथ ही डिवाइस में एक और दिलचस्प बात यह है कि यह करीब मिनट तक पानी में रह सकता है और इससे इसको किसी भी तरह की हानि नहीं होगी । इस डिवाइस का सबसे बड़ा आकर्षण है इसकी कीमत जो कि केवल रुपये है । यदि आप एक ऑक्टा कोर प्रोसेसर व बेहतरीन एंड्रायड डिवाइस चलना चाहते हैं और आपका बजट भी कुछ कम है तो आप ये डिवाइस ले सकते हैं लेकिन आपका बजट इससे कुछ ऊपर है तो आप किसी और कंपनी का डिवाइस जरूर परखें । सोशल साइट फ्रेंडली होने के लिए इसमें रीयर कैमरा और फ्रंट कैमरा भी है । इसमें उपभोक्ताओं की प्रतिदिन की जरूरतों के लिए पर्याप्त या उससे कहीं ज्यादा काम करने वाली एमएएच बैटरी पैक का उपयोग किया गया है । इसके अलावा फीचर्स के मामले में यह दमदार हेंडसेट है । भारतीय बाजार के लिए मोटोरोला का यह मोटो एक्स उपभोक्ताओं के लिए एक लुभावना मौका है । मात्र ग्राम वजनी इस स्मार्टफोन में एमएएच की बैटरी लगी है । इसमें इंच का एचडी डिस्पले स्क्रीन अल्ट्रा वाइड व्यूइंग एंगल के साथ दी गई है जिससे पिक्चर्स बेहतर क्वालिटी में दिखती है । लेनोवो एक बेहतर कैमरा स्मार्टफोन है । इसमें जीबी इंटरनल मेमोरी दी गई है जिसे मेमोरी कार्ड के तहत जीबी तक बढ़ाया जा सकता है । इस फोन में एमएएच की बैटरी लगी है जो काफी लंबे समय तक चलती है । तकनीक वाले इस स्मार्टफोन में दो सिम लगती है । कंपनी ने अन्य स्मार्टफोन्स से हटकर में ऑडियो डॉल्बी एट्मॉस यूनिक तकनीक दी है जिससे हेडफोन लगाकर ऑडियो बहुत ही बढिया साउंड क्वालिटी के साथ सुनेंगे । एंड्रॉयड किटकैट पर काम करने वाले इस फोन में जीबी तक का माइक्रोएसडी कार्ड लगता है । यह शानदार परफोर्मेश वाला है क्योंकि कंपनी ने इमें जीबी रैम और गीगाहर्त्ज क्वॉडकोर प्रोसेसर दिए हैं । यूजर इंटरफेज के अनुसार यह शानदार है क्योंकि ए ंड्रॉयड के लेटेस्ट वर्जन पर काम करता है जो कई सारे नए फीचर्स से लैस है । माइक्रामैक्स केनवस एक अच्छा कैमरा स्मार्टफोन भी है । माइक्रोमैक्स केनवस स्मार्टफोन में एमएएच की जबरदस्त बैटरी दी गई है । इस स्मार्टफोन में जीबी इंटरनल मेमोरी दी गई है जबकि एक्सटरनल मेमोरी के तौर पर इसमें जीबी तक का माइक्रोएसडी कार्ड लगता है । सैमसंग गैलेक्सी के जूम की सबसे खास बात ये है कि इसमें मेगापिक्सल सीमॉस कैमरा सेंसर एक्स जूम तथा जिनॉन फ्लैश के साथ पीछे की तरफ लगा है । जबकि फ्रंट में मेगापिक्सल कैमरा लगा है । इसमें इंच की सुपरअमोलेड डिस्पले स्क्रीन लगी है । आर्या स्मार्टफोन कीमत रूपए रखी गई है हालांकि यह रेडमी से हजार रूपए ज्यादा हैं लेकिन इस रेंज के अन्य स्मार्टफोन्स के मुकाबले बेहद कम है । स्लिम और चौकारे कार्नर वाले आर्या स्मार्टफोन दिखने में सोनी एक्सपीरिया सीरीज स्मार्टफोन्स की तरह लगता है । इसमें इंच की बड़ी आईपीएस एचडी ओजीएस डिस्पले स्क्रीन लगी है जो रेडमी के इंच डिस्पले से बड़ी है । यह इसी खूबी के चलते इसे फेबलेट के रूप में भी काम में लिया जा सकता है । आर्या स्मार्टफोन में दिए गए फीचर किसी हाई एंड स्मार्टफोन की तरह है । इससें एचडी रिकॉर्डिग की जा सकती है । यह और दोनों नेटवर्क पर काम करता है । इसमें एमएएच बैटरी लगी है जो लंबे समय तक चलने वाली है । कोई ऑप्शन खोलने के लिए जैसे ही आप मुंह से बोलकर कमांड देते हैं तो फट से वह काम कर देता है । जहां इसकी कीमत चाइनीज युवान लगभग हजार रूपए रखी गई है । दिखने में यह स्मार्टफोन कि सी टेबलेट की तरह लगता है क्योंकि इसमें इंच की बड़ी और फुल एचडी डिस्पले स्क्रीन दी गई है । जेडटीई स्मार्टफोन में बेहतर परफोर्मेश के लिए गीगाहर्त्ज क्वॉलकोम स्नैपड्रेगन प्रोसेसर रैम दिए गए हैं । कंपनी ने इसमें मेगापिक्सल कैमरा डयूल एलईडी फ्लैश के साथ पीछे और मेगापिक्सल कैमरा डिग्री वाइड एंगल के आगे की तरफ दिया गया है । इसमें जीबी

तक का स्टैंडबाइ टाइम मिलेगा । इसकी खूबियों की बात करें तो की पैड अच्छी क्वालिटी का है जो फोन को इस्तेमाल करने के अनुभव को आरामदायक बनाता है । लेकिन किफायती कीमत के कारण इसमें शायद कंपनी ने कई सुविधाएं नहीं दी हैं । शायद वट्सएैप की भरपाई के लिए फोन में फेसबुक का एक अलग बटन दिया गया है । पांच चटख रंगों जिनमें नारंगी गुलाबी और सफेद जैसे रंग शामिल हैं में यह फोन युवाओं के लिए लुभावना हो सकता है । इस फोन में स्क्रीन की ब्राइटनैस को कम ज्यादा करने का विकल्प मिलेगा । इस फोन की एक बड़ी कमजोरी है इसमें यूएसबी पोर्ट का न होना । मतलब केबल के माध्यम से कंप्यूटर आदि से आप गाने यां क्लिप्स इस पर ट्रांसफर नहीं कर सकते हैं । इसके लिए ब्लूटूथ डोगल यां मेमोरी कार्ड रीडर का इस्तेमाल करना होगा जो अत्यंत असुविधाजनक है । अगर आप के पास एक एंड्रायड आधारित हैंडसेट है तो इसे दूसरे हैंडसेट के तौर पर खरीदा जा सकता है । इसका इस्तेमाल मोटे तौर पर फोन करने यां सुनने एसएमएस करने अथवा एफएम सुनने में ही होगा । इसकी स्क्रीन इंच की है । इस फोन का पिछला हिस्सा जो सिल्वर रंग का है हटाकर काले रंग के रियर पैनल से भी बदला जा सकता है । इस फोन के साथ एक रियर पैनल निशुल्क मिलता है । आजकल स्मार्टफोन का इस्तेमाल बहुत सी एप्लीकेशन्स को एक साथ चलाने के लिए किया जाता है लेकिन एमबी की रैम से इन सबको इस्तेमाल करने में उतनली सहूलियत नहीं होगी जितनी की एक जीबी की रैम के साथ होगी । फोन के ग्राफिक्स की क्वालिटी औसत से कुछ बेहतर है इसे बहुत शानदार भी नहीं कहा जा सकता है । फोन में दो कैमरा हैं एक आगे और एक पीछे । यह एक औसत दर्जे का फोन है । इसकी खासियत है इसका जानदार रियर कैमरा । लेकिन अन्य ज्यादातर फीचर्स के मामले में इसमें कुछ ऐसा विशिष्ट नजर नहीं आता जो इस कीमत श्रेणी में फोन खरीदने वालों को अपनी ओर लुभा सके । इसकी कमजोर रैम के कारण इसे इस्तेमाल करने वालों को कुछ असुविधा भी हो सकती है । युवाओं के लिए यह फोन कमजोर रैम के कारण बहुत ज्यादा उपयुक्त नहीं है मध्यमवर्गीय और साल से अधिक आयु के कामकाजी लोग गृहिणियां यां स्कूली छात्र चाहें तो इसे अपने पहले मोबाईल फोन के तौर पर आजमा सकते हैं । फोन के रियर पैनल पर ही एमपी क्षमता का कैमरा एलईडी फ्लैश के साथ मिलता है । फोन में कुछ गेम्स निशुल्क डाउनलोड की जा सकती हैं । इसकी एमएएच बैटरी दो दिन तक आराम से चल सकती है लेकिन अंततः यह इस बात पर निर्भर करता है कि आप फोन का कितना ज्यादा इस्तेमाल करते हैं लेकिन फिर भी कहा जा सकता है कि फोन को बहुत जल्दी और बार बार चार्ज करने की जरुरत नहीं पड़ेगी । पहले फोन आए फिर स्मार्टफोन और अब सुपरस्मार्ट फोन आ रहे हैं । इन सुपरस्मार्टफोन को मुख्यतः तीन कसौटियों पर कसा जाता है बड़ी स्क्रीन नए एप्लीकेशन्स और ज्यादा शक्तिशाली प्रोसेसर । एलजी ने आप्टिमस जी को सुपरस्मार्टफोन के तौर पर बाज़ार में उतारा है । फोन की बाॅडी बहुत ही पतली है इसका बैक पैनल शीशे का बना है । जिन्हें बटन से फोन कैमरा इस्तेमाल करने का आदत है उन्हें कुछ मुश्किल भी हो सकती है । इस श्रेणी के अन्य कई फोनों की तुलना में आप यहां कहीं बेहतर स्पीड पाएंगे । इस फोन की एक खासियत इसका इंटेलीजेंट वर्चुअलकी बोर्ड भी है । किसी भी शब्द पर दो बार टैप करेंगे तो वह फोन में बनी डिक्शनरी में खुद ब खुद सुरक्षित हो जाएगा और जब भी जरूरत हो इस्तेमाल के लिए सामने आ जाएगा । फोन में पोलेरिस आफिस एप सहित कई अन्य ऐसे एप्लीकेशन्स हैं जो आपको रोजमर्रा के कामकाज में मददगार साबित होंगे । लेकिन गेमिंग आदि का मज़ा उठाना हो तो यह फोन पसंद कर सकते हैं । इस माॅडल में पिक्सल और पांच इंच की शानदार स्क्रीन है । अथवा गीगीहर्टज़ का प्रोसेसर है । एमएएच बैटरी है । फोन की स्क्रीन शानदार रिजोल्यूशन और इसका कम वजन इसे आकर्षक बनाता है । लेकिन फोन में कई फीचर्स ऐसे हैं जो रोजमर्रा की जिंदगी में इतने काम के नहीं । फोन का प्रोसर और और जीबी की रैम इसे निश्चित ही अच्छी स्पीड देते हैं । अनुवाद के लिए मौजूद ट्रांसलेशन टूल और गूगल के ट्रांसलेशन टूल में कोई खास फर्क नहीं लगता है । इतने पैसे खर्च करने के बाद इस फोन से ऐसा कुछ खास नहीं मिल पाएगा जो इससे कुछ कम कीमत के माडलों में न मिल रहा हो । हो सकता है युवाओं को यह ज्यादा पसंद न आए । स्क्रीन का रिज़्ोल्यूशन गुणा पिक्सल है जिसकी वजह से ग्राफिक्स स्पष्ट दिखते हैं । इस फोन में याहू मैसेंजर भी है और वट्स एैप का लिंक डाउनलोड किया जा सकता है । इस फोन में एक साथ फ्रंट और रियर कैमरा का इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है जो सुविधा कई अन्य एंड्रायड फोन में उपलब्ध नहीं है । इस माॅडल में गीगाहर्ट्ज़ का क्वाड कोर प्रोसेसर है और एक जीबी रैम है । ग्राफिक्स की प्रोसेसिंग के लिए इसमें एडरिनो चिप लगाया गया है । इंटरनल स्टोरेज की है जिसे माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड से जीबी तक किया जा सकता है । बातचीत की आवाज़ ठीक ठाक आती है जबकि गाने सुनने का अनुभव भी औसत दर्जे का है । यह एक औसत फोन है खासकर दिखने में । इसमें दो जीएसम सिम कार्ड लगाने की सुविधा है । एंड्रायड जैली बीन आपरेटिंग सिस्टम के साथ इस फोन का प्रोसेसर गीगाहर्टज़ क्षमता का है । लेकिन रैम केवल की है । फोन में एक से ज्यादा एप्लीकेशन्स को एक साथ खोलने में कुछ समय लग सकता है । फोन में इंटरनल स्टोरेज जीबी की है इसे बढ़ाकर जीबी तक किया जा सकता है जिसके लिए माइक्रोएसडी कार्ड इस्तेमाल करना होगा । फोन में दो कैमरे हैं रियर अर्थात फोन के पिछले हिस्से में लगा कैमरा मेगापिक्सल का है जिससे खीचंी गई तस्वीर की क्वालिटी ठीक ठाक है फ्रंट कैमरा मेगापिक्सल का है । इस फोन के साथ कम्पनी रूपये का डाटा पैकेज भी दे रही है जिसमें आउडिया टीप का तीन महीने का सब्सक्रिप्शन और जीबी डाटा शामिल है । अपनी कीमत के अनुरूप फीचर्स इसमें नहीं हैं । एप्पल ने आईफोन के फिंगरप्रिंट सेंसर और कैमरे पर सैफाइअर ग्लास कोटिंग का इस्तेमाल किया है । विंडोज फोन यूजर्स होम स्क्रीन के टाइल्स को कस्टमाइज भी कर सकते हैं ठीक वैसे ही जैसे एंड्रॉयड फोन यूजर्स वॉलपेपर बदलते हैं । ऐप की कमी है । विंडोज फोन यूजर्स के लिए ऐप स्टोर पर काफी सारी ऐप मौजूद हैं । आपको यहां लगभग सभी जरूरी ऐप मिल जाएंगी लेकिन अभी भी आईओएस और एंड्रॉयड की तुलना में यहां एप्लिकेशंस की संख्या कम ही है । इसमें प्रोसेसर क्वालकॉम का नया ओक्टा प्रोसेसर स्नैपड्रैगन दिया गया है जिसमें बिट ऑक्टा कोर प्रोसेसर लगा होता है । यूरेका के लुक और विजेट्स को लेकर आप इसे आराम से कस्टमाइज कर सकते हैं । साइनोजन ओएस की यह खास बात है कि अपीयरेंस के कस्टमाइजेशन के मामले में आप इसमें कई फेरबदल कर सकते हैं । गूगल ऐप्स के अलावा यू यूरेका यूयूनिवर्स नाम का ऐप प्रोवाइड करता है । एक खास बात यह कि सूरज की रोशनी में भी आप इसे पढ़ सकते हैं । बनावट मज़बूत है और मैं यह तो नहीं कह सकता कि यह आकर्षक दिखनेवाला डिवाईस है लेकिन मैं इसे बदसूरत भी नहीं कहूंगा । बिल्ट और डिज़ाईन विभाग में यू यूरेका अपनी कीमत पर खरा उतरता है । इसमें रिमूवेबल बैट्री होने की वजह से इसे कुछ अतिरिक्त गुण मिलते हैं लेकिन यह कुछ ऐसा अलग नहीं है जिसकी आपने उम्मीद की होगी । इस आकार के लिए डिस्प्ले में शार्पनेस और रिजॉल्यूशन की कमी है । व्यूविंग ऐंगल्स वैसे तो बुरे नहीं है बहुत ही वाईड ऐंगल से भी थोडे और फिर कुछ रंग नहीं दिखते । यह मौजुदा सबसे स्थिर रॉम में से नहीं है और कभी कभार डिवाईस पर ऍप क्रैश भी होते हैं । हम अभी भी दोनों को डिवाईसो को एकसाथ रखकर इस्तेमाल कर रहे हैं लेकिन कुछ भी ऐसा उभर कर नहीं आया जिससे कुछ खास फर्क दिखे । इस डिवाईस के पिछले कैमरा का वाईट बॅलेंस और कलर रिप्रॉडक्शन अच्छा है । लेकिन थोडे हलके इस्तेमाल के तहत जिसमें थोडी वेब ब्राउज़िंग और कुछ गेमिंग शामिल है यूरेका ने पूरे दिन तक मेरा साथ दिया । माइक्रोमैक्स जो कीमत मांग रहा है उसके लिए यूरेका पूरी तरह से समाधान प्रदान करता है । अगर आपको हज़ार रूपयों के नीचे फॅब्लेट चाहिए तो आगे बढ़कर इसे खरीदें । जो समझौते आप करेंगे उनके लिए कीमत पूरी तरह से उचित है और माइक्रोमैक्स ने अब तक बनाये हुए स्मार्टफोनो में से यूरेका आसानी से सबसे अच्छे स्मार्टफोन में से एक है । विंडोज़ ऐप इकोसिस्टम का अभाव है । एक फैबलेट होने के नाते लुमिया एक बड़ा डिवाइस है पर यह लुमिया लुमिया की तरह कुछ ज्यादा ही भारी नहीं है । हालाँकि इसका डिजाईन अगर देखें तो बढ़िया है इस स्मार्टफ़ोन में आपको कलर फुल पॉलीकार्बोनेट की बैक मिल रही है और इसके साथ ही अगर इसके फ्रंट की बात करेइ९न तो इसमें प्लास्टिक का फ्रंट है । इसका बैक में दिया गया रियर कैमरा काफी अच्छा लग रहा है । यह स्मार्टफ़ोन इस प्राइस टैग में आसानी से फिट हो रहा है । डिजाइन के मामले में अच्छा दिखता है । इसके अलावा बैकपैनल में इस्तेमाल की गई प्लास्टिक बेहद ही पतली है । ये दोनों ही फोन रैम के साथ आते हैं । इनमें अंतर एंड्रॉइड वर्जन और स्क्रीन साइज का है । इस स्मार्टफोन ने हमारी मानसिकता को बदल कर रख दिया फिर चाहे वह बजट के मामले में हो या अफोर्डेबल सेगमेंट के मामले में । श्याओमी का स्मार्टफ़ोनआज एक सबसे किफ़ायती स्मार्टफ़ोन कहा जा सकता है । सात हजार रु की कीमत में आपको इस वक्त बाजार में इससे बेहतर दिखने वाला फोन नहीं मिलेगा । और सैमसंग की फैक्टरी से निकले अब तक के सबसे खूबसूरत फोन है पर क्या सिर्फ खूबसूरत डिजाइन ही काफी है या फिर परफॉर्मेंस के मामले में भी ये फोन सब पर भारी है । ये फोन गजब का दिखता है । हालांकि किसी किसी एंगल से देखने पर से मिलता जुलता लगता है पर इसकी वाली डिजाइन इसे भीड़ से अलग करती है । इस फोन के दोनों तरफ ग्लास डिस्पले दिया गया है । जैसे आप अपनी फेवरिट कॉलर के लिए अलग अलग रंग की थीम चुन सकते है जो फोन आने पर इसके पर अलग दिखायी देगी । डिजाइन में भी ये फोन काफी कॉम्पैक्ट है जेब और हाथ में आसानी से फिट बैठता है । आगे और पीछे ग्लास डिजाइन होने के कारण सैमसंग ने अपने इन दोनों ही फोन को ज्यादा मजबूत बनाने की कोशिश की है । की प्रोटेक्शन के साथ फोन के चारों और दी गई मेटल फ्रेम भी इस बार सैमसंग के फ्लैगशिप फोन को शायद पहली बार प्रीमियम लुक दे रही है । अब आज की तारीख में स्मार्टफोन बनाने वाली कंपनियां फोन के फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरे को हल्के में नहीं लेती और उसे भी अच्छी तरह से डिजाइन करती है । फोन के ऊपरी और निचले हिस्से की तरफ दी गई कर्व्ड डिजाइन अच्छी लगती है । इस फोन के बैक पैनल पर लेदर टेक्सचर दिया गया है । माइक्रोमैक्स कैनवस सेल्फी की डिजाइन में एक बहुत बड़ी कमी ये है कि फोन के स्पीकर पीछे की तरफ दिए गए हैं । जिओनी कंपनी अपने स्लिम और स्लीक स्मार्टफोन्स के लिए फेमस है । डिजाइनिंग के मामले में ये पहले वर्जन से थोड़ा अलग है । इसी के साथ मेटल फ्रेम है जो फोन को प्रीमियम लुक देने के साथ साथ सुरक्षा के नजरिए से भी बेहतर है । बेजल स्क्रीन की साइड बॉडी काफी कम है तो फोन के फ्रंट साइड का ज्यादातर हिस्सा स्क्रीन को ही कवर कर रहा है । फुल एचडी होने के कारण स्क्रीन में कलर काफी बेहतर दिखते हैं व्यूइंग एंगल भी इस फोन में अच्छे हैं । कुल मिलाकर लुक्स और डिस्प्ले के मामले में इस फोन को अच्छे नंबर दिए जा सकते हैं । पिछले साल दस हजार रु से कम कीमत में अगर कोई भी स्मार्टफोन लेना होता तो सबसे पहला नाम का आता था । कम दाम में का भरोसा और ठीकठाक फीचर वाला ये फोन पिछले साल सस्ता फोन चाहने वाले कन्ज्यूमर्स के बीच सुपरहिट रहा था । डिजाइन में अच्छा है । है । बिना फ्लैश वाला कैमरा है । स्क्रीन के व्यूइंग एंगल्स भी खराब है । दुनिया की नंबर एक टेलिकम्युनिकेशन इक्विपमेंट बनाने वाली कंपनी है । दिखने में बड़ा पर वजन में हल्का और हाथ से आसानी से फिसलता नहीं । कभी कभी करता है । एक हाथ से इस्तेमाल नहीं कर सकते है । के वक्त फोन थोड़ा स्लो लगता है । कैमरा स्पीड तेज फोकस लॉक करने की स्पीड कम । की तुलना किसी लग्जरी घड़ी से की जा सकती है क्योंकि एक एक फोन की फिनिशिंग हाथ से की जाती है । पैसा वसूल है । दिखने में बेहद खूबसूरत । बढ़िया स्क्रीन है । हजार रु की कीमत में खूबसूरत सी डिजाइन वाला इंच का फोन मिलता है । वो भी फुल स्क्रीन के साथ है । मजबूत बनावट है । स्टॉक ऍण्ड्रॉइड यूआई है । विस्तारीत ना होनेवाला स्टोरेज । सबसे किफायती ऍण्ड्रॉइड स्मार्टफोनों में से एक है ; जो नेक्सस के जैसी विशेषताओं के साथ प्रस्तुत हुआ है । जो अपने अनुमानित मूल्य निर्धारण और तगड़ी विशेषताओं के लिए सबका ध्यान आकर्षित कर रहा था । स्मार्टफोन का डिस्प्ले आइपीएस पैनल है जो पिक्सल रिजॉल्यूशन के साथ इंच के आकार में है । डिस्प्ले ग्लास स्मार्टफोन की अगली बाजू को पूरी तरह से ढंकता है जिससे धब्बो और उंगलियों के निशानों की संभावना बढ़ जाती है । कुल मिलाकर हम डिज़ाईन को लेकर हम काफी खूश है और मोटोरोला ने मोटो जी के रूप में बहुत ही अच्छा काम कर दिखाया है । हरदिन स्मार्टफोन का परफॉर्मंस सुखद मिल रहा है ; शायद इसलिए क्योंकि यह स्टॉक ऍण्ड्रॉइड पर चलता है इसलिए इसमें कोई कस्टम यूआई या लेयर्स नहीं है जो हमें व्यक्तिगत तौर पर पसंद आये । मोटो जी में कैमरा मेगा पिक्सल से सक्षम है जो जाहिर है कि उस वर्ग में सबसे अच्छा नहीं है । अच्छी रोशनी में फोटो बिल्कुल शार्प और बारीकीयों से भरपूर आते हैं । एड्रेनो जीपीयू बेंचमार्क परिक्षण के तहत कुछ कम क्षमता का साबित हुआ । अब तक इस बजट में खरीदने के लिए यह सबसे अच्छे स्मार्टफोनो में से एक है । मिज़ू एप्पल के आईफ़ोन सी की बराबरी का है इस स्मार्टफ़ोन में की डिस्प्ले है इसके साथ ही अगर प्रोसेसर पर आयें तो इस स्मार्टफ़ोन में ओक्टा कोर मीडियाटेक का प्रोसेसर है स्मार्टफ़ोन में की रैम भी है । हमारी नज़र में एक्सपीरिया ज़ेड वन कॉम्पैक्ट उन सबसे बेहतरीन स्मार्टफ़ोन्स में से एक है जिसे आप खरीद सकते हैं । इस फ़ोन के बायीं तरफ माइक्रो यूएसबी पोर्ट माइक्रो एसडी कार्ड स्लॉट और माइक्रो सिम कार्ड स्लॉट हैं और ये सभी पानी से सुरक्षा के लिए कवर से ढंके हुए हैं । हम स्वीकार करते हैं कि सोनी का टाइमस्केप यूजर इंटरफ़ेस थोड़ा बोरिंग था अगर आपको खेल पसंद है तो ज़ेड वन कॉम्पैक्ट आपको बिलकुल निराश नहीं करेगा स्नैपड्रैगन चिपसेट के साथ जीबी रैम और एड्रीनो जीपीयू के साथ यह स्मार्टफ़ोन हर तरह के खेलों को बहुत आसानी से चलाता है । हमने इस पर खेल अथवा विडियो चलाने में किसी भी तरह की देरी या रुकावट महसूस नहीं की । स्पीकर के आवाज़ की क्वालिटी अच्छी है लेकिन हम कुछ और तेज़ आवाज़ चाहते थे । कम रोशनी में कैमरा थोड़ा धीमा हो जाता है अच्छा कैमरा है । सुपर प्रीमियम के निर्माण और डिज़ाइन है । धीमी गति से ऑटो फोकस होता है । यदि यह एक सामान्य कीमत टैग के साथ एक प्रमुख डिवाइस होता तो हम सभी इसे पसंद करते । तो आदर्श रूप से इस फोन के लिए एक समीक्षा संभव नहीं है । ब्लू गोल्ड संस्करण हमें मिला है वह सच में एक अच्छा लगनेवाला फोन नहीं है । स्टेनलेस स्टील के शरीर के बावजूद इसमें काफी फिसलन है । हाँ यह भारी है लेकिन यह लगभग किसी भी अन्य फोन से मजबूत है जिसका हमने आज तक उपयोग किया है । वास्तव में आइकोन्स के साथ में जो एक छोटा परिवर्तन किया गया है वह बहुत ही बदसूरत है । हालांकि बैटरी विभाग में यह कई फ्लेगशिप से मेल खाता है और यहां तक कि उन्हें पिछे भी छोड़ता हैं । रियर स्नैपर इष्टतम प्रकाश की स्थितियों के तहत महान छवियों को लेता है और कम प्रकाश के तहत भी अच्छी तरह से प्रदर्शन करता है । बाकी यह सब कुछ वही देता हैं जो अन्य प्रमुख फोन जो कि इस फोन की एक चौथाई से भी कम कीमत वाले हैं प्रदान करते है । कीमत के लिहाज से मोटोरोला मोटो ई एक अच्छा फोन कहा जाएगा लेकिन इस बजट में टक्कर देने के लिए कई फोन पहले से उपलब्ध हैं । फोन में एक साफ सुथरा और अच्छा ऑपरेटिंग देखने को मिलता है । नए ऑपरेटिंग में कई तरह के बदलाव किए गए हैं जैसे एंडरॉयड बटन बदल गए हैं और कार्ड स्टाइल नोटिफिकेशन भी अच् अहसास कराता है । फोन में गूगल एप्स के अलावा डॉक्सक और माइग्रेट जैसे कुछ अच्छे एप्लिकेशन भी हैं । कैमरे के साथ फ्लैश न होना भी एक बड़ी कमी कही जाएगी । कैमरे से ली गई पिक् की क्वारलिटी अच्छी है लेकिन बहुत बेहतर नहीं कह सकते । इसके अलावा टच अहसास भी बहुत अच्छा है । फोन का बैटरी बैकअप अच्छा है । नया मोटो ई भी इन् खासियतों से लैस है । फोन को एंडरॉयड ऑपरेटिंग लॉलीपॉप पर पेश किया गया है । इंच की बड़ी स् के साथ पेश किए गए इनफोकस में जीबी इंटरनल मैमोरी है । बजट को देखते हुए स्पेसिफिकेशन अच्छे कहे जाएंगे । हालांकि इस बजट में फिलहाल इससे ज्यादा की आशा नहीं कर सकते । रही बात कैमरा क्वालिटी की तो जो आशा कर रहे थे उस पर यह खरा नहीं उतरता । इंटडोर में अच्छी खासी रोशनी के बावजूद फोटो में रोशनी की कमी लग रही थी । पुराना एंडरॉयड और साधारण डिजाइन थोड़ी समस् हो सकती है । बिल्ट क्वालिटी अच्छी है और स्पेसिफिकेशन के मामले में तो कहना ही नहीं । इसके अलावा एक बात और कही जा सकती है कि पुराने फोन से यह बहुत अलग नहीं है । क्वालकॉम स्नैमपड्रैगन चिपसेट आधारित इस फोन में गीगाहर्ट्ज क्वाडकोर प्रासेसर दिया गया है जबकि इसके पुराने संस्करण रेडमी में गीगाहर्ट्ज का क्वालकॉम स्नैपड्रैगन प्रोसेसर दिया गया था । फोन से लगी गई तस्वीर की क्वा लिटी बहुत अच्छी है और कैमरा भी बेहद तेज है । कैमरे के साथ फ्लैश दिया गया है लेकिन बहुत उपयोगी नहीं कहा जा सकता । जहां तक फोन के लुक की बात है तो देखने में शानदार है । एंडराॅयड के मामले में यह थोड़ा पीछे है । अच्छे स्पेसिफिकेशन के बाद की कमी कही जा सकती है । छोटी स्क्रीन में न आप सही तरह से ब्राउजिंग कर सकते हैं और न ही बेहतर तरीके से एप्लिकेशन का मजा ले सकते हैं । परंतु कम रेंज के फोन में ज्यादातर स्मार्टफोन छोटी स्क्रीन के साथ ही उपलब्ध हैं । आरंभिक स्तर के इस फोन की बिल्ट क्वालिटी अच्छी है । फोन का बैटरी बैकअप अच्छा है और एक बार चार्ज करने पर डेढ़ दिन निकालने में सक्षम है । यदि रूपए कीमत के फ़ोन की बात हो तो मैं कहूँगा की आप एंड्राइड फ़ोन ले । इस फ़ोन का डिस्प्ले ठीक ठाक ही है पर कोनो से देखने पर ठीक नज़र नहीं आता यह आपका वीडियो देखने का मज़ा किरकिरा कर सकता है । यूतुब पर भी विडियो अच्छे से लोड कर लेता है लेकिन विडियो क्वालिटी इतनी खास नहीं । पर इस फ़ोन की सबसे बड़ी खामी ही इसका कैमरा है इससे ली फोटो इतनी खास नहीं और ज़ूम करने पर तो फोटो ख़राब हो जाती है । कमजोर प्रोसेसर की वजह से यह थोड़ा स्लो चलता लग रहा है । ऑल ग्लास बॉडी वाले इस स्मार्टफोन को काले नीले लाल और सुनहरे रंग के विकल्प के साथ उपलब्ध कराया गया है । इस ड्यूल सिम स्मार्टफोन में इंच की डिस्पले स्क्रीन दी गई है । इस पर खरोंच नही आ सकती और यह भी दावा किया जा रहा है कि मजबूती के मामले में यह दूसरे फोनों की तुलना में चार गुना ज्यादा मजबूत है । सैमसंग स्टार टीवी में एनालॉग मोबाइल टीवी रिसीवर है जिसके द्वारा अब आप अपने मोबाइल में ही मनपसंदीदा टीवी कार्यक्रम देख सकते हैं । पुराने मॉडल की तुलना में इसके ज़्यादातार विनिर्देश वही हैं परन्तु इसमें वाईफाई की सुविधा उपलब्ध नहीं है । इसके अलावा इसमें टच विज़ यूआई एज ब्लूटूथ कनेक्टिविटी की विस्तार क्षमता मेगापिक्सेल का कैमरा जो लोगों की मुस्कान पहचान लेता है और स्टीरियो आरडीएस के साथ साथ और भी बहुत सारी खूबियां हैं । कुल मिलाकर ये अभी तक का सबसे सस्ता लुमिया सेल्फी फोन कहा जा सकता है । ये सेल्फी और वीडियो कॉलिंग में अच्छी क्वालिटी देगा कैमरा फीचर्स के साथ माइक्रोसॉफ्ट के प्री लोडेड ऐप्स जैसे स्काइप और वननोट उपलब्ध हैं । इसमें इंटरचेंजेबल बैक कवर हैं । ये फोन उन लोगों के लिए अच्छा साबित हो सकता है जिन्हें कम बजट में बेहतर सेल्फी फोन चाह रहे हैं । इसी के साथ फोन में रैम दी गई है अौर बैटरी की बात करें तो इस फोन में की बैटरी है । हो सकता है ये कुछ यूजर्स को निराश कर दे । ये उन लोगों के लिए अच्छा है जिन्हें की जगह डाटा पैक डलवाना होता है । हालांकि एंड्रायड किटकैट के मामले में भी कुछ मार्केट में मोटोरोला ने अपने डिवासेज को अपडेट कर गूगल को पीछे छोड़ दिया । लेकिन इस वर्ष लग रहा कि एलजी अव्वल हाे जाएगा । अगर कैमरा की बात करें तो इस नए स्मार्टफ़ोन में फ़्लैश के साथ रियर और का फ्रंट फेसिंग कैमरा है । इस स्मार्टफ़ोन के कनेक्टिविटी आप्शनस में आपको सपोर्ट के साथ वाई फाई ब्लूटूथ जीपीआरएस / एज जीपीएस और के साथ मिल रहा है । इस नए स्मार्टफ़ोन में बाज़ार में आने से एक फ़ास्ट डेवलपिंग टेक्नोलॉजी वाला स्मार्टफ़ोन आपको एक बढ़िया कीमत में मिल सकेगा । बहुत गुणवत्तापूर्ण ढंग से निर्मित और उपयोग करने में आसान है । बिना किसी रूकावट के परेशानी रहित प्रदर्शन करता है । स्क्रीन के फिंगरप्रिंट मैगनेट है । इसका मूल्य थोड़ा कम रखा गया होता । वर्तमान समय में उच्च कीमत वाले फ्लैगशिप स्मार्टफोन में एलजी यकीनन सर्वश्रेष्ठ डिजायन वाला स्मार्टफोन है । इसका डिस्प्ले इंच का है और प्लास्टिक बॉडी और ब्रश्ड मेटालिक फिनिश के साथ यह मात्र मिमी मोटा है । एलजी ने एक विशेष फिल्म का निर्माण किया है जो डिवाइस से प्लास्टिक की अनुभूति को समाप्त कर देता है और ब्रुश्ड फिनिश के साथ यह फोन को बहुत ही सुन्दर रंग रूप और अनुभूति प्रदान करता है । एलजी ने ऐसा दो कार्यों के द्वारा किया है पहला फोन को बहुत ही स्लिम बेज़ल पतली तिरछी धार देते हुए और दूसरा और पृष्ठ भाग को वक्र आकार देकर किया है । जबकि को एक हाथ से संचालित करना उतना आसान नहीं है यह अन्य डिवाइस जिनका स्क्रीन छोटा है कि तुलना में बहुत बेहतर कार्य करता है । यह बहुत पुष्ट अनुभव कराता है और एक बार जब आप के पीछे के बटन को उपयोग करने के अभ्यस्त हो जाते है तब आप इसे दूसरे तरीके से नहीं करना चाहेंगे । यह डिस्प्ले अच्छा है परन्तु नंगी आँखों से एक क्वैड एचडी एक फुल एचडी से भिन्न नहीं दिखाई देता है जो उपभोक्ता के लिए मात्र एक नौटंकी बन कर रह जाता है । हालांकि जब आप घर के अन्दर होते है तब डिस्प्ले एकदम स्पष्ट और चमकीला दिखाई देता है । इससे यूआई को सीखना और उपयोग करना आसान हो जाता है जबकि कुछ नया जोड़ते हुए कि फोन कैसा महसूस होता है । एलजी के द्वारा जोड़ा गया पारदर्शक नोटिफिकेशन बार एक ऐसी विशेषता है जिसे एंड्राइड एल प्रीव्यू में देखा गया था यदपि बिना कार्ड आधारित नोटिफिकेशन के । नॉक कोड अनलॉक फीचर विशिष्टता आपके फोन को कुछ अतिरिक्त सुरक्षा प्रदान करता है और इसे उपयोग करना बहुत ही आसान है । आप एक विशिष्ट नॉक पैटर्न निर्धारित कर सकते है जो आपको फोन को अनलॉक करेगा । इसका प्रदर्शन बहुत ही बेहतर है यूआई में कोई बाधा नहीं या जटिल और उच्च गेम जैसे कि डेड टाइगर एस्फाल्ट और इंजस्टिस गोड्स अमंग अस खेलते समय कोई रूकावट नहीं उत्पन्न होता है । फोन थोड़ा गर्म हो जाता है परन्तु इसे ठंडा होने में भी बहुत कम समय लगता है । इसके साथ यह इतना अधिक गर्म नहीं होता है कि इसे पकड़ने में असुविधा महसूस हो जो कि बहुत अच्छा है । प्रदर्शन के मामले में से हमारी कोई शिकायत नहीं है । यह अन्टुटू एक्स क्वैड्रेंट स्टैण्डर्ड और स्मार्टबेंच बेंचमार्क पर भी बेहतर प्रदर्शन करता है । वर्तमान समय में कैमरा निश्चित रूप से सर्वश्रेष्ठ है । हमने इसकी जाँच आईफोन के साथ की और पाया कि कैमरा सफेद रंग को नियंत्रित करने और सपूर्ण तस्वीर की गुणवत्ता के मामले में के बहुत निकट आता है । कम प्रकाश में तस्वीर खींचने में आईफोन से भी बेहतर है । साथ ही कैमरा एलजी के सम्पूर्ण यूआई से भी संकेत ग्रहण करता है और बहुत ही साधारण और तेज है । किसी भी स्मार्टफोन के लिए यह बहुत अच्छा परिणाम है । हालांकि एलजी को फोन की कीमत थोड़ी कम रखनी चाहिए थी । बहुत अच्छा कैमरा परफॉर्मेंस है । चमकीला फिनिश इसे बहुत फिसलने वाला बनाता है । दायें किनारे के बीच में गोल पावर / लॉक की वॉल्यूम रॉकर कीज और थोड़ी बड़ी कैमरा शटर कीज हैं जो अब प्रयोग में बहुत ही आरामदेह हैं । पानी से पोर्ट और स्लॉट्स की बचाव के लिए लगे फ्लैप भी अपग्रेड किये गये हैं और बहुत मजबूत लगते हैं । यह हैंडसेट हाथ में रखने पर बहुत अच्छा महसूस होता है । सोनी ने अपनी वाटरप्रूफ और डस्टप्रूफ रेटिंग को भी आर्इपी के साथ अपग्रेड किया है । इसका यूआर्इ अधिक स्मूथ और फ्लूइडिक लगता है तथा इसके एनिमेशन्स में निश्चित रूप से सुधार किया गया है । निश्चित रूप से इसमें आपको सोनी के सारे एप्प्स मिलते हैं जैसे एलबम मूवीज वॉकमैन बैक अप और रेस्टोर लाइफ लॉग सोनी सेलेक्ट सोशल लाइफ ट्रैक आर्इडी और बहुत कुछ । आप इसमें कोर्इ भी गेम डाल सकते हैं और यह उसे बिना किसी गड़बड़ी के रन करेगा । साथ ही वॉकमैन एप्प को कुछ न्यू ऑडियो इन्हैंसिंग फीचर्स के साथ अपडेट किया गया है जिसमें सोनी र्इयरफोन्स के लिए खास तौर से निर्मित प्रोफाइल्स का चुनाव शामिल है । साथ ही दो स्टीरियो लाउडस्पीकर्स बहुत ही तेज हैं और वे उतने रिफाइन्ड तो नहीं हैं जितने कि एचटीसी डिवाइसेज में लगे बूमसाउंड लेकिन वे एक प्रभाव जरूर डालते हैं । जब कैमरे की बात आती है तब हम सोनी को एक पायोनियर के रूप में देखते हैं । यह पिक्चर को सॉफ्ट बनाता है लेकिन फिर भी इसमें बहुत से डिटेल्स होते हैं । कॉम्पैक्ट की तुलना में इसमें थोड़ा सुधार हुआ है खास तौर से शॉट लेने के टाइम के मामले में या कैमरा एप्प खुलने के मामले में । इसकी कीमत रू. है जो अपेक्षित कीमत की सीमा से थोड़ा अधिक है और यह सोनी की एक और विफलता का एक कारण बन सकता है । एक हाथ से इस्तेमाल के लिए बहुत बड़ा है । स्क्रीन और बॉडी पर धब्बे लगने की संभावना है । फोन के साथ बॉक्स के बाहर कोई स्क्रीन गार्ड लगा हुआ नहीं है । पिछला पैनल धब्बे और उंगलीयों के निशान आसानी से ले लेता है जो परेशान करनेवाला है । इस स्मार्टफ़ोन में मेगापिक्सेल का रियर कैमरा जोकि आपको ऑटो फोकस के साथ मिल रहा है । साथ ही दो स्टीरियो लाउडस्पीकर्स बहुत ही तेज हैं वे उतने रिफाइन्ड तो नहीं हैं जितने कि एचटीसी डिवाइसेज में लगे बूमसाउंड लेकिन वे एक प्रभाव जरूर डालते हैं । ग्लॉसी डिस्प्ले इंच की फुल एचडी आइपीएस स्क्रीन है । फोन में पावर बटन दाहिनी ओर और वॉल्यूम रॉकर बाईं ओर दिया है । दोनों बटन सख्त प्लास्टिक से बने हैं जो सस्ते दिखते हैं और दबाने के लिए सख्त है और फोन को अनलॉक करते समय पावर बटन देर से रिस्पाँस करता है । इसमें जीबी इंटरनल मेमरी के साथ जीबी रैम है । पिछला बीएसआइ सेंसर है जबकि अगला स्टँडर्ड बीएसआइ सेंसर है फोटो की क्वालिटी उतनी असरकारक नहीं थी जितनी की एक मेगा पिक्सल कैमरा से उम्मीद होती है । फिर भी वीडीयोज काफी अच्छे थे । डिवाईस का फुल एचडी आइपीएस डिस्प्ले स्मूद लगता है और रंग नैचरल लगते हैं । उसके व्यूविंग ऐंगल्स अच्छे हैं और स्मूद टच प्रस्तुत करता है लेकिन संवेदनशीलता उम्मीद के हिसाब से नहीं है और कई बार फोन कुछ टच इनपूटों को नज़रअंदाज करता दिखता है । दुसरी तरफ वीडीयो प्लेबैक प्रभावशाली है फुल एचडी वीडीयोज हल्के ग्रेनी दिखते है जबकि कोई लॅग थोड़ासा रिड्रॉ होता है लेकिन उसे नज़रअंदाज़ किया जा सकता है नहीं था । हमें जो अच्छा नहीं लगा वह था डिस्प्ले धब्बों को खुद की तरफ खिंचता दिख रहा था और आपको हर बार कुछ मिनटों के बाद स्क्रीन पर से उंगलीयों के निशानो को पोंछना पडेगा । फोन ऍण्ड्रॉइड फिचर वन हॅण्ड ऑपरेशन को सपोर्ट करता है ऐसा कुछ जो हमने सॅमसंग गॅलेक्सी नोट में भी देखा था । इस मोड में फोन का यह हाल होने का कारण था फोन का बड़ा आकार फोन इतना बड़ा है कि वह एक हाथ से इस्तेमाल हो ही नहीं सकता । हर बार जब आप अपने फोन को कम्प्यूटर से कनेक्ट करते हैं आपको यूएसबी मास स्टोरेज सक्षम करना पड़ता है जो की हमें काफी परेशानीवाली बात लगी । बेहतरीन कैमरा है । प्रभावशाली डिस्प्ले की वजह से पर वीडीयोज़ देखना बहुत ही सुंदर अनुभव रहा । हमने फुल एचडी वीडीयोज़ चलाएं और उसमें हल्के रिड्रॉ के साथ हल्का सा ग्रेन आया लेकिन उससे पूरे अनुभव में कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ा । इयरफोन इन इयर प्रकार के नहीं है और बनावट और ऑडियो क्वालिटी में सस्ते लगते हैं । हमने स्पीकर से ऊंचे आवाज़ की उम्मीद की थी । क्वालिटी एचडीआर मोड में बेहतर है । हमने जल्दी से पता लगाया की समस्या उसके साथ दिये गए चार्जर में है क्योंकि फोन पीसी से कनेक्ट करने के बाद जल्दी चार्ज होता है । इसके आगे हमने एक फुल एचडी फाइल फुल ब्राइटनेसपर वाइफाइ अनेबल्ड और एक सिम कार्ड के साथ एक घंटा चलाई एक घंटे के प्लेबैक के बाद बैट्री से तक ही उतरी जो की बहुत ही जबरदस्त प्रदर्शन रहा था । इन संख्याओं को देखते हुए हम यह नतीजा निकाल सकते हैं की यह डिवाईस सामान्य उपयोग में आसानी से एक दिन से ज्यादा चलेगा । जीबी का इंटरनल स्टोरेज बहुत कम है । नुबिया यूआई अभी भी तेजी से सीखने की अवस्था में ही है । बिल्ट क्वालिटी असल में अच्छी है उसमें हमें कोई समस्या नज़र नहीं आई । वह मज़बूत लगता है और आपके हाथ और जेब में आसानी से समा जाता है । कंपनी ने उसमें मेट फिनिश बॅक कवर दिया है जो की बढ़िया लगता है खासकर सफेद रंग में और बैक कवर निकाला जा सकता है । इसके अलावा आगे ड्रैगनट्रेल ग्लास प्रोटेक्शन दिया है वैसा ही जैसा आपने जिओमी रेडमी में देखा होगा यह कांच व्यावहारिक तौर पर खरोंचों से मुक्त है लेकिन गोरिला ग्लास प्रोटेक्शन में जो प्रिमिअम फील है उसकी इसमें कमी है । यह साथ ही आकर्षक दिखनेवाला डिवाईस है । पहली यूआई मल्टिटास्कींग विकल्प नहीं देता जो मुझे निश्चित तौर पर लगता है कि काफी लोगों को पसंद नहीं आयेगा । रेडमी की तरह ही इसका यूआई डिवाईस की बहुत सारी मेमरी ले लेता है ज्यादातर सिर्फ एमबी रैम बाकी छोडता है । साथ ही ज़ेडटीइ की बैट्री काफी प्रभावशाली है मैंने आसानी से डिवाईस को पूरे दिन इस्तेमाल किया । कंपनी डिवाईस को सेल्फी के लिए बना फोन कहती है और मेगा पिक्सल के फ्रंट शूटर के साथ इसमें दम नज़र आता है । कैमरा कम रोशनी में असफल होता है नॉइस लेवल बहुत ज्यादा बढ़ जाता है और तस्वीरो में ग्रेननेस ज्यादा दिखता है । अगर जीबी पूरी तरह से एक्सेसीबल होता तो शायद मैं इस फोन की सिफ़ारिश कर सकता था विभाजन ने इसे एक बड़ी निराशा बना दिया है । प्रिमियम दिखावट तथा अच्छी बनावट क्वालिटी । कैमरा औसत दर्जे की प्रतिमाएं लेता है । आसानी से गर्म हो जाता है । यह निश्चित तौर पर कार्बन का अबतक का सबसे अच्छा दिखनेवाला स्मार्टफोन है टाइटेनियम ओक्टेन प्लस यह प्लास्टिक ढाँचे के बावजूद कुल मिलाकर मजबूत बनावटवाला स्मार्टफोन है । साथ ही इसकी बनावट इर्गोनोमीकली है और यह हाथ और जेब में अच्छी तरह से फीट बैठता है और एक हाथ से इस्तेमाल करने के लिए आसान है । जैसा की कहा है यह मोटो एक्स के जैसे इस्तेमाल के लिए आसान नहीं है लेकिन बाकी कईं बड़े डिवाईसों के जैसे असुविधाजनक तौर पर बड़ा भी नहीं है । बाजार में मौजूद अन्य कई ओक्टा कोर स्मार्टफोनों की तरह यह भी मीडीयाटेक प्रोसेसर से संचालित है जिसकी क्षमता के साथ एआरएम है । स्टॉक ऍण्ड्रॉइड का इस्तेमाल करना अच्छी कल्पना थी पर कार्बन फोन में क्रियान्वयन करते समय कुछ कमी रह गई । कार्बन ने इस टाइटेनियम ओक्टेन प्लस में बैट्री ड़ाली है जो भीतर के शक्तिशाली प्रोसेसर के साथ कदम मिलाते हुए संघर्ष करती नज़र आती है । नियमित इस्तेमाल के दौरान डिवाईस को दिन में दो बार चार्जिंग की ज़रूरत पड़ेगी अगर आप इसे ज्यादा इस्तेमाल करते है तो एक और भी । हालांकि कई एंड्रॉयड डिवाइसेस की तुलना में इसमें अभी भी बहुत कमियां है लेकिन विंडोज के अभी आ रहे सभी फोन में बेशक इसे सबसे अच्छा कहा जा सकता है । अगर आपको एक शक्तिशाली स्मार्टफोन चाहिए जो रूपयों से कम कीमत का हो तो आप मोटोरोला मोटो जी ले सकते हैं । अच्छी क्वालिटी का कैमरा है । स्क्रीन की खराब क्वालिटी । बेकार की स्टाइल है । डिवाइस पकड़ने में कोई मुश्किल नहीं आती लेकिन हां इसे पकड़ने के लिए आपको दोनों हाथों की जरूरत पड़ेगी । इंच के आईपीएस एलसीडी पैनल के लिए एलजी ने मात्र रिजॉल्यूशन का प्रयोग किया है जो स्क्रीन को किसी भी तरह गुणवत्ता की श्रेणी से बाहर कर देता है । स्क्रीन साइज बड़ी होने और रिजॉल्यूशन कम होने के कारण स्क्रीन पर पिक्सल आसानी से नजर आ जाते है खासकर टेक्स्ट पढ़ने के लिए यह बिल्कुल भी अच्छा नहीं कहा जा सकता । स्क्रीन भी फिंगरटिप मैग्नेट पर काम करता है और इसका व्यूइंग एंगल भी कहीं से अच्छा नहीं माना जा सकता । इस फोन में संभवत सारा ध्यान नोकिया ने इसके दोनों कैमरों पर ही लगाया है । डिवाइस प्रयोग की साधारण जानकारी के लिए बनाए गए प्रॉम्प्ट नोटिफिकेशन के साथ इसमें साधारण शॉर्ट लर्निंग कर्व्स भी दिए गए हैं । परफॉर्मेंस की बात करें तो शायद यह लो रिजॉल्यूशन की स्क्रीन से भी कहीं ज्यादा निराशाजनक साबित होती है । एलजी का यह फैबलेट परफॉर्मेंस में केवल तभी ठीक काम करता है जब आप इससे मात्र कॉल करने मेल चेक करने या वीडियो देखने जैसे परंपरागत काम करते हैं । इससे ज्यादा या अलग काम करने पर डिवाइस बहुत जल्दी गर्म हो जाता है जबकि इसी कीमत में आने वाले बाजर के कई अन्य उत्पादों में ऐसी परेशानी नहीं आती । में विशेष रूप से डाले गए रबर पॉइन्ट स्टाइलस का एक प्रकार से कोई यूज नहीं है फैबलेट को दूसरे तरीके से खोलने के अलावे यह बेकार है । इसमें किसी तरह का कोई खास एप भी नहीं है आप स्टाइलस का एक्स्ट्रा उपयोग कर सकें । फैबलेट की कॉल क्वालिटी बेशक डिवाइस पर अच्छी है लेकिन एक बार फिर लाउडस्पीकर पर आवाज नहीं के समान है । टेस्टिंग में पी एचडी वीडियो हमने बिना किसी रुकावट के देखी लेकिन ऑडियो क्वालिटी और धीमी आवाज इसकी कमी बन जाते हैं । कुल मिलाकर स्टाइलस का परफॉर्मेंस अच्छा नहीं कहा जा सकता । कैमरे की पिक्चर क्वालिटी अच्छी है लेकिन कई फोटोग्राफ्स में धुंधलापन की समस्या भी दिखी । बैटरी के मामले में भी कुछ हद तक अच्छा कहा जा सकता है । हालांकि नेविगेशन यूज करने पर या गेम खेलते हुए बैटरी बड़ी तेजी से खर्च होती है । अपने शब्दों पर हम अभी भी कायम हैं और इस तरह एलजी स्टाइलस बेहद निराशाजनक है । सैमसंग के स्टाइलस के साथ बिग फोन के मुकाबले अपने स्टाइलस फोन को खड़ा कर पाने का यह अवसर एलजी ने एक प्रकार से गंवा दिया है जबकि यह इससे बहुत बेहतर करते हुए ऐसा कर सकता था । डिवाइस में कोई भी एक्स्ट्रा एप या फीचर नहीं है जो एक प्रकार से फैबलेत के यूज को बेकार बना देता है । अच्छी क्वालिटी ब्राइट डिस्प्ले है । बैटरी लाइफ अच्छी है । विंडोज फोन का इकोसिस्टम अभी भी एंड्रॉयड और आईओएस के बराबर नहीं कहा जा सकता । दोनों ही कैमरे वाइड एंगल कैमरा तो हैं ही साथ ही इस रेंज के स्मार्टफोन में सबसे अच्छे कमरों की श्रेणी में आते हैं । फ्लॉलेस फिनिश के साथ इसके गोलाकार किनारे फोन की मजबूती का एहसास कराते हैं । इसकी एकमात्र कमी पीछे की तरफ बना स्पीकर ग्रिल है । डिस्प्ले कलर्स तथा इसके व्यूइंग एंगल्स बेहद प्रभावी हैं । हालांकि कलर रिप्रोडक्शन और सनलाइट विजिबिलिटी दोनों ही जगह नोकिया लूमिया कहीं ज्यादा बेहतर है । लंबे समय तक माइक्रोसॉफ्ट और नोकिया दोनों ने ही बहुत अधिक रैम देने पर सहमत नहीं थे लेकिन शुक्र है कि लूमिया से इसमें बदलाव लाया गया है । हॉलीवुड में इस जोनर पर फिल्म बनाने वाले फिल्ममेकर्स की कोशिश है कि इन फिल्मों को दर्शकों के साथ ही मेकर्स के लिए भी लाभ का सौदा बनाया जा सके । इसलिए मेकर्स की कोशिश होती है कि ज्यादा से ज्यादा लोगों का मनोरंजन किया जा सके । अर्नाल्ड श्वेजनेगार ने इस बार ऐसा ही कुछ प्रयोग किया है । हालांकि कहानी बीच में कई बार भटक जाती है । यही कारण है कि दर्शक फिल्म से जुड़ नहीं पाते हैं । सबकुछ फिल्म में बोरिंग सा लगता है । अर्नाल्ड इस बार बहुत ही सीरियस किरदार में है । यह पहला मौका है जब उन्होंने ऐसा किरदार निभाया है । अर्नाल्ड की मौजूदगी से फिल्म में कुछ देर के लिए ही सही मगर बात तो बनती है मगर कहानी की गडमड से बात उलझ जाती है । फिल्म में कुछ देर बाद अन्य हॉरर फिल्मों जैसा ही महसूस होने लगता है । कोई बड़ा थ्रिल तो नहीं देखने को मिलता । एक मौका तो ऐसा आता है जब इसे देख बिलकुल भी डर नहीं लगता है । यह देख लगता है कि फिल्ममेकर ने क्या सोचकर फिल्म बनाई । फिल्मिस्तान ने यह काम बहुत खूबसूरती के साथ किया था । अफसोस कि वेलकम कराची का विचार तो नेक कटाक्ष और मजाक का था लेकिन लेखक निर्देशक की लापरवाही से फिल्म फूहड़ और कमजोर हो गई । याद करें तो कभी इस फिल्मं में इरफान खान थे । अभी जो भूमिका जैकी भगनानी ने निभाई है उसी भूमिका को इरफान निभा रहे थे । दो लूजर शम्मीर और केदार एक दुर्घटना की वजह से अनजाने ही कराची पहुंच जाते हैं । उन्हें भारतीय जासूस व आतंकवादी समझा जाता है । दोनों अलग अलग किस्म के संगठनों के हाथों इस्तेमाल किए जाते हैं । दोनों किरदारों की टिपपणियों में कटाक्ष भी रहता है लेकिन निर्देशक उसे बढ़ाते या गहराते नहीं हैं । दरअसल उन्हें एक कमजोर कलाकार के साथ नाथ दिया गया है इसलिए कॉमेडी की गाड़ी ढंग से चल ही नहीं पाती । अभिनेत्री और सहयोगी कलाकारों के लिए न तो पर्याप्त संवाद थे और न दृश्य । सही सोच और कल्पना न हो तो वीएफएक्स बुरा हो जाता है । सिनेमा और उनके स्टार और गाने हमारी जिंदगी में प्रवेश कर चुके हैं । उन्हें हिंदी समाज का देसीपन हंसाएगा । खूब जबरदस्त ड्रामा होता है । मजेदार है कि फिल्मे खत्म होने तक सभी अविश्वसनीय प्रसंग उचित और तार्किक लगने लगते हैं । आप दत्तो और दत्तोे के साथ मनु और राजा अवस्थीन के संयोगों पर यकीन करने लगते हैं । पहले सहयोगी कलाकारों की बातें कर लें । राजेन्द्र गुप्ता केके रैना दीप्ति मिश्रा नवनी परिहार समेत छोटे बच्चों ने अपने किरदारों से कहानी में रंग भरे हैं । किसी एक की कमी से कुछ खाली रह जाता । फिर दीपक डोबरियाल मो. जीशान अय्यूब जिमी शेरगिल एजाज खान स्व्रा भास्कर सभी ने अपने एटीट्यूड से कहानी का ऐसा ताना बाना कसा है कि फिल्म की बुनाई मजबूत और रंगीन हो गई है । बहकने का खतरा ज्यादा था जिसे उन्होंने और निर्देशक ने संभाला है । आर माधवन ने मनु के स्वभाव और स्वर को सही पकड़ा है । लेखक निर्देशक ने तवेमरि की नाटकीय प्रेमकहानी में कुछ जरूरी सवालों को भी टच किया है । दत्तो के किरदार में कंगना रनोट का आत्मसविश्वाास देखते ही बनता है । कुछ किरदार ऐसे होते हैं कि उन्हें योग्य कलाकारों का समर्थन मिल जाए तो वे यादगार बन जाते हैं दत्तों ऐसा ही किरदार है । राज शेखर और कृष्णों की जोड़ी एक बार फिर निराले अंदाज में फिल्म की जरूरतें पूरी करती है । इस समय सेम्युअल जैक्सन कुछ और भी अच्छा कर सकते हैं । कारण कि अब वो जो करते हैं वो बोरिंग सा लगता है । वे जानते हैं कि दर्शकों को क्या पसंद है । हालांकि पूरी फिल्म के दौरान आप इस बात से ऊपर नहीं सोच पाते कि फिल्म विश्वास से परे है । प्लॉट बहुत ही बकवास है । जैक्सन कई मौकों पर अपनी ही कुछ चर्चित लाइन्स दोहराते नजर आते हैं । विलेन का किरदार भी पुरानी फिल्मों से बहुत ही ज्यादा मिलता जुलता है । अमेरिकन एक्सेंट में बात करते ब्रिटिश एक्टर को देखना सुखद है । जैक्सन हमेशा की तरह मनोरंजन करते दिखते हैं । आपने कितनी ही बार डिजाजस्टर मूवी देखी होगी । हालिया रिलीज फिल्म सैन एंड्रियास भी ऐसी ही एक फिल्म है । इसमें जो कुछ भी है वो आप पहले भी कई बार देख चुके हैं । दर्शक बैठे बैठे ही थक जाए । इसमें जितनी भी बिल्डिंग गिराई गई है ऐसा लगता है कि वो देखकर ही आप थक गए । कुछ मौकों पर पिता और बेटी के रिश्तों को दर्शाने की बात भी की गई है । बाकी का काम एलेक्जेंड्रा डड्डारियो के लुक पर छोड़ दिया है । मगर यह भी नाकाफी ही लगता है । मगर इससे बात बनती नहीं है । फिल्म को लिखा है लिंडलोफ ने । दो साल बाद जब फिल्म रिलीज हुई तो थोड़ी निराशाजनक रही । यह बिलकुल ऐसा था कि मिस्ट्री बॉक्स खुला और उसमें से कुछ भी नहीं निकला । डिज्नी अपनी फिल्म टूडी में प्रेजेंट करता है बजाए थ्रीडी के । यह भी एक सीक्वेंस ही है । मिस्ट्री और मनोरंजन का अहसास इस बात को मजबूती देता है । यही कारण है कि फिल्म में आप बोर नहीं होते हैं । इस बात के लिए जेम्स वेन को धन्यवाद दिया जाना चाहिए कि उन्होंने हॉरर फिल्मों के जोनर को ऐसा फार्म बना दिया है जो आपको नुकसान नहीं पहुंचाता । स्ट्रेटजी भी सिंपल होती है । इस रीमेक की खास बात यही है कि यह मूल फिल्म से बहुत दूर है । साथ ही इसमें ऐसी भी कोई बात नहीं है जो आपको लगे कि आप पहले भी देख चुके हैं । सुरखाब उन फिल्मों में शुमार है जिन्हें छोटा बजट होने के बावजूद आप अच्छी फिल्मों में शामिल कर सकते हैं । यहां जिस हिसाब से फिल्म बनती हैं से लेकर दर्शक इन फिल्मों को कैसे लेते हैं इसका भी ध्यान रखा गया है । वैसे दो एवेंजर्स फिल्मों के बीच हर साल दो मार्वल फिल्म्स दर्शकों के बीच होती हैं । इसलिए ये इंतजार कभी इतना ज्यादा भी नहीं लगता । ये सभी बातें एवेंजर्स एज ऑफ अल्ट्रॉन में देखने को मिलती है । इस बार इस फिल्म में किसी भी तरह का समय खराब नहीं किया गया है । पहले सीन में ही एवेंजर्स का ग्रुप बुरे लोगों से लोहा लेते नज़र आया है । इसके अलावा फिल्म में कुछ शानदार लोकेशंस है और बुरे लोगों को पीटते हमारे सुपरहीरोज है जो आपको मजा देते हैं । जब बात एंटरटेनमेंट वेल्यू की होती है तो डायरेक्टर जोस व्हीडन इस मामले में आधा प्रयास नहीं करते हैं । थॉर और कैप्टन कुछ मूव्स साथ करते भी दिखाई देंगे । इस बार हॉक आई को भी बड़ा हिस्सा मिला है । हालांकि इस फिल्म में पिछली फिल्म जैसा कुछ नहीं है । इसलिए आपको ये होने का इंतजार भर करना पड़ता है । कहानी में लड़ाईयां है मगर ये विलेन अल्ट्रॉन को मार्वल फिल्म का कमजोर विलेन ही साबित करती है । जेम्स स्पाडर की आवाज अच्छी है । हालांकि विजन खूबसूरत है जो बताता है कि भविष्य की फिल्म में ये और भी बड़ा होगा । कारण कि उड़ना लात मारना बिल्डिंग पर चढ़ना मुक्के मारना आदि सीन को देखकर लगेगा कि हो क्या रहा है । शोनाली बोस की निजी जिंदगी संबंधों और भावनाओं की उथल पुथल से कांपती रही है । उन्हें अपनी रिश्ते की बहन मालिनी और खुद की कहानी कहनी थी । सेरेब्रल पालसी में मनुष्य के अंगो के परिचालन में दिक्कतें होती हैं । दिमागी तौर पर वे आम इंसान की तरह होते हैं । उनकी सामान्य चाहतों पर भी सवाल करता है । मार्गरिटा विद ए स्ट्रॉ सही मायने में रोचक और रोमांचक फिल्म है । भरपूर इमोशनल थ्रिल है इसमें । शोनाली बोस को कल्कि कोइचलिन का पूरा सहयोग मिला है । उन्होंने लैला को आत्मसात कर लिया है । हाव भाव और अभिव्यक्ति में वह कोई कसर नहीं रहने देतीं । उन्हें सयानी गुप्ता और रेवती का बराबर साथ मिला है । बेटी के लिए चिंतित होने पर भी वह नई चीजों को लेकर असहज नहीं होतीं और न हाय तौबा मचाती हैं । मार्गरिटा विद ए स्ट्रॉ माता पिता और बेटी बेटों के साथ देखी जाने वाली फिल्म है । इसे या तो रोग या फिर जोक माना जाता है । हिंदी फिल्मों में समलैंगिक किरदार हास्यास्पद होते हैं । लैला के जरिए शोनाली बोस एक साथ अनेक सामाजिक ग्रंथियों को छूती हैं । वे अपनी फिल्में कैमरे से शूट भी करते हैं लेकिन इस तकनीकी कुशलता के बावजूद उनकी मिस्टर एक्स में कथ्य और निर्वाह की कोई नवीनता नहीं दिखती । फिल्म में उनका किरदार ढंग से लिखा भी नहीं गया है । अरूणोदय सिंह अपनी मौजूदगी से प्रभावित नहीं काते । उन्हें अभी तक अभ्यास की जरूरत है । भट्ट कैंप की फिल्मों का संगीत कर्णप्रिय होने की वजह से लोकप्रिय होता है । इस बार वह मधुरता नहीं है । फिल्म में भट्ट साहब ने शीर्षक गीत में आवाज दी है । कृष्ण गीता और रघु व सिया के प्रतीकात्मक नाम ... सब फिजूल रहा । फिल्म इंडस्ट्री में कोर्टरुम के अनेक वर्जन दिखाए गए हैं । जहां एक डिफेंस लॉयर है तो एक प्रोसिक्यूशन लॉयर और साथ में हैं मायलॉर्ड्स । इस तरह से यह सीन पूरा होता है । मगर इस मराठी हिन्दी गुजराती और अंग्रेजी फिल्म में यही बात एक अलग ढंग से सामने आती है । इस फिल्म की सबसे खास बात यही है कि मल्टिपल अवॉर्ड जीतने के बाद भी यह फिल्म बेहद साधारण होकर असाधारण बन पड़ी है । गीतांजलि की परफॉर्मेंस बहुत अच्छी है । बाकी कलाकारों ने भी अच्छा सहयोग किया है । हालांकि गोंबर को गुजराती एसेंट में कुछ परेशानी हुई मगर फिर भी अपने किरदार में बने रहने का उनका प्रयास अच्छा था । दर्शकों को ऐसी फिल्में देखने की जरूरत है । जिसमें अजीबोगरीब चेहरों के बजाए अच्छे से दर्शाए गए कैरेक्टर हों और जो अच्छी एक्टिंग भी करे । फिल्म का प्लॉट ऐसा हो जो शुरू से लेकर अंत तक आपको बांधे रखे । यह वो फिल्म है जिसकी चर्चा फेस्टिवल के समय जोरों पर थी । फिल्म में एक्सीक्यूशन का ही महत्व होता है । डायरेक्टर ने कैमरे का इस्तेमाल ही इस ढंग से किया है कि फिल्म में होने वाली हर तरह की घटना आप महसूस करते हैं । बालों का हवा में उड़ना हो या फिर धीरे से बढ़ती हुई खामोशी यह सारी वो बातें हैं जो आपको डर को महसूस कराने में कारगर साबित होती है । तीसरा जो है वो इसके आगे के दशक का लगता है । यह वो बातें हैं जो फिल्म को रोचक बनाने के साथ ही मजेदार बनाती है । वैसे इस बात के अनेक उदाहरण हमारे सामने हैं कि कितना कठिन है बॉलीवुड से हॉलीवुड की ओर जाना । शेखर कपूर ही एक अपवाद रहे हैं जिन्होंने हॉलीवुड फिल्म एलिजाबेथ बनाई और इसे सराहना भी मिली । उनके अलावा कोई भी इस रेखा को पार नहीं कर पाया है । '"

              "'judging from previous posts this used to be a good place but not any longer . we there were four of us arrived at noon the place was empty and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude . they never brought us complimentary noodles ignored repeated requests for sugar and threw our dishes on the table . the food was lousy too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny . after all that they complained to me about the small tip . avoid this place i have eaten at saul many times the food is always consistently outrageously good . saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn . the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world . the wine list is interesting and has many good values . for the price you can not eat this well in manhattan . i was very disappointed with this restaurant . ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away . i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested . food was okay nothing great . chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family . i/we will never go back to this place again . went on a day oyster binge with fish bringing up the closing and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended because it was so great service was devine oysters where a sensual as they come and the price ca n t be beat you ca n t go wrong here . every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant saul on smith street . everything is always cooked to perfection the service is excellent the decor cool and understated . i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible . ca n t wait wait for my next visit . i had my eyes on this place promising myself i will one day ` give it a try . and i hate to say this but i doubt i ll ever go back . the food is very average ... the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet every thing they serve is too sweet here . the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree . i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty lrb could ve used a bit more salt rrb . anyways if you re in the neighborhood to eat good food i would n t waste my time trying to find something rather go across the street to tamari . the decor is night tho ... but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite unappetizing and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern . we ate outside at haru s sake bar because haru s restaurant next door was overflowing . what s the difference between the two their sake list was extensive but we were looking for purple haze which was n t listed but made for us upon request the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome great appetizer to share we went around on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great we love th pink pony . the perfect spot . foodawesome . service friendly and attentive . ambiance relaxed and stylish . do n t judge this place prima facie you have to try it to believe it a home away from home for the literate heart . i have eaten here a handful of times for no reason besides sheer convenience . lrb i hang out and live in the neighborhood . rrb the food is decent . however it s the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth . i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of selfrespect which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water or the check . i know you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored but my agenda is i m here to eat and enjoy the company of friends seeking a pleasant experience . well i did n t find it there and trust i have told everyone i can think of about my experience . the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty hmmm . this place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area . i had a great experience . food is great . service is top notch . i have been going back again and again . i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin which was heavenly at sushi rose . it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistencynot too fishy creamy and slightly buttery . the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned . the rice to fish ration was also good they did n t try to overpack the rice . we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it . i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently . she lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy . surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth . in the evening this place attracted a well dressed with it ny crowd . the food was well prepared and the service impecable . i m going back . having hunted around for a quiet romantic yet not hideously expensive restaurant i stumbled across reviews for la lanterna and gave it a shot . quite simply it s like stepping out of manhattan and into a haven of tranquility . the service was attentive yet unimposing the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced . the prix fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough lrb both in quantity and quality rrb . i will be going back and heartily recommend it i ve had the lunch buffet at chennai a couple of times when i have been in the neighborhood . it is terrific as is the value . $ and there is much tasty food all of it fresh and continually refilled . i am not a vegetarian but almost all the dishes were great . frankly when you compare what you can have here for lunch versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city there is no comparison . go hungry and enjoy . the food here is rather good but only if you like to wait for it . i like the somosas chai and the chole but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing . the service varys from day to day sometimes they re very nice and sometimes not . the kitchen however is almost always slow . also specify if you like your food spicy its rather bland if you do n t . the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation so a casual lunch here would probably be best . just went here for my girlfriends bday . if you ve ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer . add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening . the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it . once you step into cosette you re miraculously in a small offthebeaten path parisian bistro . this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets with that certain parisian flair . the food was average to aboveaverage ; the french onion soup filling yet not overly impressive and the desserts not brilliant in any way . however go for the ambience and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world i have never eaten in the restaurant however upon reading the reviews i got take out last week . it was horrible . the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n t even fully melted it looked like shredded cheese partly done still in strips . i have eaten at many pizza places around nyc and this is hands down the worst . this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn . the pizza is overpriced and soggy . yes they use fancy ingredients but even fancy ingredients do n t make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right . a big disappointment all around . i think i ve had some the best meals of my life at minnow . the seafood is amazing there s a good wine list and the everchanging menu always offers some great surprises . the combination of superfresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious . worth the trip from manhattan . was there friday night . best pastrami i ever had and great portion without being ridiculous . and i ve been to many nyc delis . my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it . price no more than a jersey deli but way better . as a japanese native i ve lived in the tristate area for over years but i was just so amazed at this place . this place is the most japanese it can ever get . the signs the specials menus food and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese . this place is worth an onehour drive . i am so coming back here again as much as i can . leon is an east village gem casual but hip with well prepared basic french bistro fare good specials a warm and lively atmosphere . my wife and i always enjoy the young not always well trained but nevertheless friendly staff all of whom have a story . sit outside in the warm weather ; inside for cozy winter . decent wine at reasonable prices . have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience . our teenage kids love it too . everytime i decide to try another place on the ues i get angry that i did n t just go to zucchero pomodori . this is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood . the service is excellent the decor is great and the food is delicious and comes in large portions . you ll pay at least double at any other italian restaurant in the city and most still do n t compare . i m partial to the gnocchi . this place is incredibly tiny . they refuse to seat parties of or more on weekends . the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive . the food was bland oily . i just do n t understand all the hype ... . we went to ino for valentines . we have been to this place many times and always have great food wine and service . we were worried we would have trouble getting in but somehow managed to have a short wait . as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited . when we sat we got great and fast service . the people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes . make sure you try this place as often as you can . this is a fun restaurant to go to . the pizza is yummy and i like the atmoshpere . but the pizza is way to expensive . a large is $ and toppings are about $ each . i went there for lunch and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read . sauce was watery and the food did n t have much flavor . if you like the food and the value you get from some of chinatown restaurants this is not the place for you . i do n t think i would go again . this place is great . i had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of . the waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal service was prompt friendly and great . slightly on the pricey side but worth it great pizza and fantastic service . there was a small wait but shorter than i expected . located at the end of a magnificent block . very cozy and warm inside ... . i will be back this is the best sushi in new york city hands down . the place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic . get the tuna of gari . the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side . planet thailand has always been a hit with me i go there usually for the sushi which is great the thai food is excellent too . with the great variety on the menu i eat here often and never get bored . the atmosphere is n t the greatest but i suppose that s how they keep the prices down . it s all about the food i went there with my friend last saturday . first it took us a long time to find the place . we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers . but when we looked at the menu there were n t a lot of choices most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section . then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi . those rolls were big but not good and sashimi was n t fresh . they were dry and disgusting i did n t even finish my first piece . hurley s is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came . try the crunchy tuna it is to die for . try everything for that matter it is all good . i have been going there since it opened and i ca n t get enough . first went here to enjoy their garden terrace . the food was amazing and the service was prompt and helpful but not overbearing or rushed . the steak tartare is a great bet they fix it for you at the table . admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm but the open kitchen is part of the charm . great wine selection gigondas is worth the price and the house champagne is a great value . it may be a bit packed on weekends but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area . have recommended the place to friends always gets good response . pizza the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional toppings the crust tastes like the best freshly baked bread veal parmigana better than patsy s much more reasonably priced too i take all my nyc guests to vt s . not sure where the previous reviewer lonk dined but saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food i ve been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences . i d highly recommend it for a special occasion it provides and intimate setting and nice service . i m not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and i all enjoy mizu very much ... and we re repeat customers . even after they overcharged me the last time i was there . make sure you have the spicy scallop roll ... . it s delicious moules were excellent lobster ravioli was very salty took my mom for mother s day and the maitre d was pretty rude . told us to sit anywhere and when we sat he said the table was reserved . stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting . tiny dessert was $ ... just plain overpriced for what it is . the drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced . try their chef s specials they are to die for . service is not exactly five star but thats not really a big deal . downstairs lounge is always a good attraction . raga s is a romantic cozy restaurant . the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations . it is also extremely well priced . the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive . the bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines . this is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed . your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem when we stumbled on leon we thought that we had found quite the gem but we were certainly wrong . the waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet we were told no ... . then to top things off she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend s jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes . such a disappointment ... . rude service medicore food ... there are tons of restaurants in ny ... stay away from this one . i had a grat time at jekyll and hyde i loved everythig about itespecially the shows and actors . our server was very helpful and friendly . i am bringing my whole family back next time . the food was good too . the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent . the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by feet away on avenue on a cool evening was wonderful . inside is a little cramped but to be expected . service was prompt and courteous . this was a repeat visit and we ll definitely be back again . great service great food . prices are in line . compared to other shabu restaurants around town this places wins handsdown . but too far east i live a block away and go to patsy s frequently . the pizza is delicious they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap frozen shredded cheese common to most pizzaria s . two complaints their appetizer selection stinks it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu . also because it is so thin it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling . so eat fast and order a lot . wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaurant . fine dining restaurant quality . over different choices to create your own . a must try on a recent sunday afternoon a friend and i accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt . this was the perfect quiet relaxing and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater . the chicken pot pie is excpetiona the cheeseburger huge and delictable and the service professional wan warm . with so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district is truly an excellent find we will return many times for this oasis in midtown . i grew up on these bagels . the staff is no nonsense . the food options rule . when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else . worth visiting the ave spot because it is the original store . i stumbled upon this second floor walkup two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from l.a. . being serious sushi lovers we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action . i asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if i like uni . lrb for those of you who do n t know uni is sea urchin in japanese which happens to be my favorite . rrb he served me an uni hand roll which i never had before and let me tell you ... it was heaven aside from the sea urchin the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail boton shrimp blue fin torro lrb fatty tuna rrb sea eel etc. . the sake menu should not be overlooked all in all this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city . try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll . we visited orsay during ny restaurant week and tried their $ menu . service was very good prompt attentive and nonintrusive . food was very good as well considering that we tried the budget selection lrb though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer so that fat was more of a meltinyourmouth experience rrb . wine list selection is good and winebytheglass was generously filled to the top . traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation . i ve been to at cafe spice probably times it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square . to sum it up service varies from good to mediorce depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average ok . seating is always prompt though the restaurant does fill up in the evening . food is usually very good though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders . as many other reviewers noticed your order is often slow to arrive this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time . the decor is vibrant and eyepleasing with several semiprivate boths on the right side of the dining hall which are great for a date . i have never been disappointed in the red eye . the first time i went and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere i ordered the lobster cobb salad . i ve never ordered anything else from their menu ... there s no need to . it s simply the best meal in nyc . you can not go wrong at the red eye grill . if we were to move from the upper east side we would genuinely miss this restaurant . we ve lived in the area for more than years . the restaurant is cute but not upscale . the food is a diamond in rough the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes . i would highly recommend it . it s one of our favorite places to eat in ny . we had a great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night . we were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks . after really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner . the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile . the place s decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh . i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks if you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained this is a great place to go and eat . my husband and i thougt it would be great to go to the jekyll and hyde pub for our anniversary and to our surprise it was fantastic . the have over different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini . the entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner . please take my advice go and try this place . its located in greenewich village . you will not be disapointed at all . our first time in new york and we had to try a new york bagel . we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem . the bagel was huge . they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior . the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese lrb gets a little messy rrb . i loved it and would highly recommend . this was my frist time at cafe st. bart s and i must say how delicous the food and the service was . when i called this morning i did n t think i would be able to get in at but i was able to get in along with four other guests . i have to highly recommend the lobster roll not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster . other guests enjoyed pizza santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips . i highly recommend cafe st. bart s for their food the ambience and wonderful service . all the staff is absolutely professional i sometimes see the waiters do n t have enough knowledge of their dishes . but they do . lrb that is a must but not every restaurant can do ... rrb . if you want to dine with large party i recommend to make reservation basement . there s nice and quiet small but enough for lrb or more rrb . this restaurant was way overhyped . my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily . okayi do n t mind the oily part lrb cause most are cooked that way rrb but it was way too bland . the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary . the service was the only thing good about this restaurant . it s boring on the inside and our sushi was pretty below average ... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor . i definitely would n t go back . there are many thai places in the city but so far toons is # . their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic . the price is reasonable although the service is poor . fresh restaurant was amazing ... ... food was delicious and of course fresh . great for a romantic evening or a fun evening with friends ... . i will be going back very soon . keep up the good work . hats off to the chef . i am not the most experienced person when it comes to thai food but my friend who took me there is . he has visited thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine . it was wonderful . the salads are delicious both refreshing and very spicy . we had pam s special fried fish and it was amazing . too large for just two people but nothing was left . unbelievable . had a late night dinner on a saturday night . great vibe lots of people . my husband and i both ordered the steak medium . my husbands was perfect my was well done and dry . i did n t complain i liked the atmosphere so much . will give it another chance before i write it off . visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews . on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch . ambience is so cute and quaint good for business although we were there on vacation . salads were fantastic . although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great . ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me . we will be back . this is some really good inexpensive sushi . it costs $ extra to turn a regular roll into an insideout roll but the roll more than triples in size and that s not just from the rice . the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i ve had at this price range . the yellowtail was particularly good as well . i have reservations about the all you can eat deal however the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ by just going off the menu . in any event this is a place i ll be sure to stop by again when i m in this part of town . big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment . they have it all great price food and service . the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can . the food is prepared quickly and efficiently . and it all comes at a very reasonable price lrb congee noodles and rice dishes are no more than $ each rrb . the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well . this place is always very crowded and popular . went here on a friend s reccomendation . enjoyed a very nice caesar salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese ... both very tasty . we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh . we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake both were delicious . we d go back again . i recently went to this restaurant with some coworkers for lunch and had an amazing time . the staff was accomodating the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely . we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves . yes the prices are high but i felt it was worth it . we all felt it was worth it . sometimes i get good food and ok service . sometimes i get bad food and bad service sometimes i get good good and bad service . it is not consistent . really depends on your luck the place is a bistro which means simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere . and where does patis go wrong ; no where . you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but cassuolet steake fritte tripe stew etc ; simple stuff . and evaluated on those terms pastis is simply wonderful . right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza . mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta lrb raddichio was kind of bitter though rrb . my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better . the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day . kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids . overall i would recommend it and go back again . coming from boston this place is like emma s pizza in kendall square in cambridge lrb although they have more funky toppings rrb i started out with a bombay beer which was big enough for two . for dinner i had the chicken tikkamasala and some garlic naan . mmmmm ... it was delicious . service was slow but the people were friendly . it s a nice place to relax and have conversation . i ca n t wait to go back . we have lived in chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant . the food is authentic italian delicious pizza is terrific as is homemade pasta . ambience is delightful service impeccable . i m still mad that i had to pay for lousy food . the hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed . service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great . do not try unless you re just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste . i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try . this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent . the filet mignon dish was superb i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices . it s a small cute restaurant . i absolutely love this place from the street it looks very hidden and is actually an old warehouse . i like the ambience it s very dark and original . i came here for my friend s birthday and keep coming back ever since . the sushi is amazing and amazingly cheap . big thumbs up very affordable and excellent ambient we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai . we were very disappointed . we wo n t go to this place again for a good meal . however i think this place is a good hang out spot . next time we would n t dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks . my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time the pizza and wine were excellentthe service too but what really made this place was the backyard dining area . it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants i have ever seen in ny i am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country . they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter so i m looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it . check this place out highly recommended first of all this place is * not * romantic as claimed by citysearch s editorial review . either that or the editor s idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table while trying to speak louder than the traffic on . the tables are crammed way too close the menu is typical of any italian restaurant and the wine list is simply overpriced . slightly above average wines start at $ with only one selection listed at $ . service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category . for instance plates were just dumped on the table i was handed the wine list upside down etc ... . somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service . to be completely fair the only redeeming factor was the food which was above average but could n t make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora . to celebrate a birthday three of us went to mare anticipating great food . not one of our meals was edible bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring . fish was overdone . cute place nice wait staff but would never go there again . someone else recommended the dessert we also left that . one of us actually liked the expresso that s it . skip this restaurant it s a big disappointment . myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the city ; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else . i ve never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious . their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for . i come from a family of pizzeria owners and i m almost ashamed to say that the pizza in fornino s blows my families receipies away . it is simply amazing . the place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious . i highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try . you will find yourself returning quite often . p.s. please do n t tell anyone in my family i eat there . lol . a restaurant that does n t try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere . no gimmicks here the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation . the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over how refreshing the service was impeccable and unobtrusive the staff knows what they are there to do to know their menu present your meal and attend to your needs . looking around i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen . beautiful experience . the view is breathtaking the service is top notch ... the ambiance is wonderfull . the staff offers impeccable service . i had lobster bisque it has oz of maine lobster in it . my boyfriend had the new england chowder it was good but i think the award should go to the lobster bisque . i had filet mignon with garlic mash . it was divine melts in your mouth . my boyfriend had prime rib it was good . we did n t want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of korbett it was just enough . we had lava cake ... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a to make it . it s cuz it s so good you need to taste it all in all we re already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food . if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo . it s very spicy but not offensive . we will definitely go back . go to volare for class service and terrific food . the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter . the wine list is excellent . the food is amazing ... especially if you get the chef s tasting menu and your favourite bottle lrb or two rrb of wine from an extensive selection of wines . the place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded but the service is excellent and it s great for friends out a romantic date or a special occassion . people dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans . the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n t like . recommendations of course are required please be aware that it s cash or amex only with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering the food here was decent not great . the menu is very limited i think we counted or entrees . we ordered the special grilled branzino that was so infused with bone it was difficult to eat . the decor in this place is very dinerish and the kind of place you expect in the east village not romantic just simple small and sparse . problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable . no plans to return anytime soon . this place is so much fun . our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant . this place must have cost the owners afortune to build . i think the stuff was better than disney . our food was great too and really large portions . the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york . we will go back every time we are in the city . if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde . it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects . the food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions . i highly recommend it . i am going to the mid town location next . the place is a lot of fun . my six year old loved it . the characters really make for an enjoyable experience . the food however is what one might expect . it is very overpriced and not very tasty . however i think jeckll and hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once . we had a good time . went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them . service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded . drinks way over priced . food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit . great pizza for lunch place . service was quick . the pizza was great . and it was quick which is very important . have the iced tea . it was wonderful . whenever you need a sushi fix mizu will be there with quality fish and great service . delivery is fast too . great friendly service fast seating fast delivery excellent sushi . a little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite . growing up in ny i have eaten my share of bagels . essabagel lrb either by stytown or midtown rrb is by far the best bagel in ny . the bagels always warm soft on the inside crispy on the outside and enormous in size . they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great . the lox is always fresh too . highly recommended to all i have to agree with the previous reviewer . i do n t get it either . not impressed with the food . prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant . zero ambiance to boot . i thought this place was totally overrated . everything we had was good or ok ... but definitely nothing great . the ambience was nice but service was n t so great . when you add it all together it just does n t seem worth it to me ... especially considering the prices . this is the best shabushabu restaurant in the trystate area . i have lived in japan for years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in japan . thius is a must for anyone who loves shabushabu . the atmosphere is nothing special but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo . the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance . despite a slightly limited menu everything prepared is done to perfection ultra fresh and a work of food art . i must give it yon out of yon stars taxan delicious arigato gozimas yuka this restaurant was recommended by a local ... as a matter of fact he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed we were n t the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food . we liked it so much that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit new york . went there for an office lunch . the location and ambience is ok but the food is what makes up for it . there is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me . try green curry with vegetables . the quantity is also very good you will come out satisfied . the service is ok some of the people did n t get what they asked for . i was there on sat for my birthday and we had an excellent time . i had the best ravioli ever . the wine the service was very good too . moderate prices . a little noise but i think that was because of our party molto bene this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list . the food is delicious from the specials to the regular menufare the dishes are never a disappointment . whether it s the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite . although the tables may be closely situated the candlelight foodquality and service overcompensate . a guaranteeed delight i have known about this secret for the last years emilio lrb the godfather rrb has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices . if you go try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce the mozzarella en carozza is mmmmmmmm ... everything is just delicious . check out the secret back room . old school meets new world . i pray it stays open forever . thank you emilio . ciao bella . i found the food service and value exceptional everytime i have been there . the food was authentic . i felt as though i were eating in paris . the service was excellent friendly and attentive . the prices are wonderfully low . very good wine choices . i ca n t believe people complain about no cheese sticks who has room for cheesesticks with the best pizza in nyc get the pepperoni yum and a family style salad . great staff . always great service i go twice a month fantastic the food is good i ca n t lie . but the staff was so horrible to us . the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out . we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order . this place is pricey and yes the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price . save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one i ll keep this short . amma is nothing special . the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place . i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive . will not be back . do n t dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes they are simply not up to par with the nonveg selections . decor is nice though service can be spotty . this place is always packed . i know because i live nearby . most importantly food is excellent . try the sea bass . highly recommended . first of all dal bukhara rocks . as a student in nyu i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by . but ive heard a lot about this for the past yrs and finally decided to eat here . i am happy i did the food was awsome . just awsome . and yes dal bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs . they are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey . but overall i give it a . . i have n t been to the other locations . haru on park s is simply disgusting . the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale . quite frankly this is some of the worst sushi i have ever tried . will never be back . honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives . believe us we ve been eating sushi for over yrs . not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly . the allucaneat sushi is definitely in very poor quality . limited menu nosofresh ingredients thinlysliced fish fallapart rice . the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce lrb even its low sodium rrb the vinegarsoaked rice and the scallion on top of the fish . the waitstaffs are nice though . wont come back again for sure i have been to roth s twice and both times were very disappointing . once for dinner and once for brunch . both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service which was boarderline rude . they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another . much of the time it seems like they do not care about you . the dinner was ok nothing i would have again . i had their eggs benedict for brunch which were the worst in my entire life i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was . this was a great surprise . with the theater blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room . the service was attentive . i look forward to eating here again . planet thai is great we love the food drinks and atmosphere the svc can be a bit rude at times esp if you have big group but overall the restaurant is a must try the pad thai it s fabulous and their prices are so cheap just because it s cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty it is great just remember the later you go the longer you may have to wait . it s popular w/the late crowd . they forgot a sandwich did n t include plastic forks and did n t include pita with the hummus platter . also the sandwiches lrb nearing $ rrb did n t come with anything like chips or a side . overall not worth the money . eating in the atmosphere saves it but at your desk it s a very disappointing experience . i love indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it . chennai garden is my favorite indian restaurant in the city . they have authentic indian at amazin prices . this restaurant is vegetarian ; there are no meat dishes whatsoever . the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches . it s a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early . patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff . the food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate . this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates . not a great place for family or general dining . lloovve this place . food is excellent . fish is so very fresh . waitstaff are very friendly . love yuka . mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood . the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent . the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great . the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing . the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices . even though its good seafood the prices are too high . the lobster sandwich is $ and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price . went to village last night for my birthday . we picked it randomly without a recommendation from someone who has been there so we were n t sure what to expect . we were very pleasantly surprised . the food was delicious lrb i had a halibut special my husband had steak rrb and the service was topnotch . when my dessert came there was a candle in it not because anyone asked for one but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort . truly the mark of an attentive waiter . i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night . we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods . we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods . why they do n t concern much of customer s health just want to make money . please do n t fool us . i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke . i recommend the jelly fish drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings certainly the stir fry blue crab . the food is so cheap and the waiters are nice . of course it is crowded but who cares . authentic shanghai style and i can not recommend a better shanghai place in new york . have frequented ` ino for several years and the food remains excellent . cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ . the large selection of bruschettas paninis tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating . lrb the asparagus truffle oil parmesan bruschetta is a winner rrb wine list is extensive without being overpriced . be sure to try the seasonal and always delicious specials . definitely a neighborhood favorite . i loved this place i almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded . the food was very good a great deal and the place its self was great . the wait staff is very freindly they make it feel like you re eating in a freindly little european town . i like cafe noir dont get me wrong it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent the service was terrible we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served . the waitress seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing . after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend asked him where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in america ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on . we did tip i guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager . the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff because despite the current one this is a great place . pizza here is consistently good . salads are a delicious way to begin the meal . you should pass on the calamari . it is thick and slightly soggy . decor is charming . service is average . what a great place . i came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband . the ambience was so fun and the prices were great on top of the fact that the food was really tasty . i was n t thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes but i guess that s the price you pay for a popular place . i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever . a gentleman maybe the manager came to our table and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order . when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants he replied this is not mcdonald s every place makes things differently . while it is understandable that every place is indeed different there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude . the service was poor restaurant poorly lit staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald s than this joint . never again i absolutely loved this place . my friends spoke so much about it for months i finally made the time to come down ear and dine in . excellent atmosphere delicious dishes good and friendly service . this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions . i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation . the wine list is also really nice . a friend from seattle and i went on a thursday night around . everything was wonderful ; food drinks staff mileau . i would highly recommend this place i have been to casimir over times and i have always had a great time there . the food is great and reasonably priced . i have tried to make reservations but both times the hostess did n t have my name . if the weather is nice try to snag an outside table . the staff has been nice but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often . my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent . from the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it . considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed . i highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service . nice family owned traditional restaurant . fresh ingredients and everything is made to order . i was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken . friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you re with . my friends and i were on vacation in ny and was referred to chance by a friend . i found the food to be outstanding particulary the salmon dish i had . i also ordered the change mojito which was out of this world . my friends settled for rice dishes but we came back the following day to try the dim sum which was good ... not outstanding but good . we ate out in the back patio which is worth it as it s cool and the music is hear well there . overall excellent restaurant i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family . the food was good . the place was nice and calm . but the service was a bit slow . i work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time . the buffet had a nice selection . the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes . service was also very good . i would go back . i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries . i would recommend roxy s for that but not for their food . my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge but they were too big for the bun . consequently their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ` nt feel like finishing them . also they were $ each i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll . it was $ not really bad for a pound of pastramibut it did n t have much tastei ve had better for less elsewhere this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant the food . the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish . and the tom kha soup was pathetic . if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go . we went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a saturday and i was thoroughly impressed with the food . the pesto pizza was excellent thincrust pizza with a nice amount of spicy italian cheese that i d never heard of before . conveniently located too being right on bedford ave . the back garden sitting area is very pleasant where you can see their personal herb garden . i will definetly be going back . we had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic . my husband said he could ve eaten several more the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had . we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful . i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one . we waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right . we will be back . love the food . it s the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food . it helps if you know what to order . and you ca n t beat the prices . highly recommended . i ve lived in ny for years and this place has it all . great food good size menu great service and an unpretensious setting . the dishes offered were unique very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages sardines with biscuits large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream lrb the best and freshest i ve ever had rrb . i m glad i was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in ny . we have tried every thai restaurant between atlantic avenue and streets and joya is the best . the freshest best variety and the fastest delivery . also very inexpensive . a great choice at any cost and a great deal . the service was excellent and the food was delicious . we are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included ceviche mix lrb special rrb crab dumplings assorted sashimi sushi and rolls two types of sake and the banana tempura . overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites but everything was delicious . definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date . average to good thai food but terrible delivery . i ve waited over one hour for food . they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice . a thai restaurant out of rice during dinner the food arrived minutes after i called cold and soggy . i actually feel like i should keep it a secret . this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money . an excellent service . went to cafe spice with of my friends on a saturday night . we were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial . she was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about indian food . we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry . the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates . we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun lrb dessert rrb recommended by the waiter . i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others . i went here with a friend on a whim we went someplace else first and could n t get a table . service here was great food was fantastic . guacamole shrimp appetizer was really great we both had the filet very good did n t much like the frites that came with but the filet was so good neither of us cared . will absolutely visit again . maybe tomorrow ;rrb . you can not go wrong with this place . the food is outstanding and the service is quick friendly and very professional . always a nice crowd but never loud . go here . good for dates or with friends . i am reluctant to write because i would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded . however it is jus too good to not praise it . by far the best pizza in manhattan . the crust is thin the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly . for all you lazy folks that do n t want to come to alphabet city i say good stay out . less wait time for me we arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly . the menu has so many fish items and oysters . we all ordered different entrees so we could share . the fish was really really fresh . i lived in maine for ten years and grew up on fish . we all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in new york . i stumbled upon this great pizzeria as i explored my new neighborhood . all of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better i highly recommend the sophia pizza . it s to die for the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back . immediately after we paid the waiter took the money and said okay you guys are outta here . there are other people waiting we were n t even at our table for more than an hour total . as we were leaving the couple standing by the door said to another waiter we re not in a hurry . our friends have not arrived yet . so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary for the people who want great food plus great service roxy is a place to avoid i ve been here twice now . the first time the sushi was outstanding the second time it was a little bland . i m sure i ll return for a final judgement tho . the blond wood decor is very soothing the premium sake is excellent and the service is great . mizu is the japenese find in grammercy . while their kitchen food is delicious their sushi is out of this world . mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else . not only is the cuisine the best around the service has always been attentive and charming . warning you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you but the food does n t quite match up . i ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor . the entree was bland and small dessert was not inspired . i expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu . the view is spectacular and the food is great . wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well definitely worth the trip to battery park city one of my favorite places in manhattan . authentic taiwanese food that s cheap ... what more could you ask for lrb besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city rrb . the cold appetizer dishes taste like the way i remember them to taste when i was growing up in taiwan . delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere . kind attentive wait staff . i really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi lrb on saffron risottoyum rrb . my friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos . delicious crab cakes too . even if the food was n t this good the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax . great neighborhood joint . this is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the basil slice . their calzones are horrific bad vomitinducing yuck . they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone . the counter service is bad . they charge different prices all the time . they re rude at times and not very friendly . no pizza for me anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet where greasy dry and tasteless are complimentary . the dosas are skimpy unattractive and drip with grease and personally i d drink popcorn topping before i d eat another one of these . the sandwiches are dry tasteless and way overpriced . calling the place hampton chutney co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too . seriously this place kicks ass . the atmosphere is unheralded the service impecible and the food magnificant . best italian food i ever had lrb and being italian that means alot rrb . it is nearly impossible to get a table so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner do not pass it up . this is such a lovely peaceful place to eat outside . the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty . it is set far from the small street it s on and there is no traffic noise . the food is good especially their more basic dishes and the drinks are delicious . this is a great place to take outoftowners and perfect for watching the sunset . great sushi experience . nice value . unique apppetizers . try sushimi cucumber roll . good spreads great beverage selections and bagels really tasty . the big complaint no toasting available . i complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted . murray wo n t do it . wo n t or ca n t is not in the service directory . but who says murray s is anything about service . so close but not good enough . do n t be fooled by crowds of people . the service is awful . this place is not worth the prices . also do n t plan on asking for your favorite roll if it s not on the menu you ca n t have it . love pizza ... . i will be out with friends and all of a sudden i am hungry and i only crave one thing ... their pizza . i live in the neightborhood and am a regular . it hits the spot every time . this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising . the pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in nyc . even the pasta is delicious here lrb a rarity in new york pizza restaurants rrb . i ve been many time and have never been disappointed . compared to essa tal offers a less doughy bagel they even scoop it out nice lrb for those on a diet rrb not too much not to little . the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee a little crowded but they move that line really fast a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning bagels are ok but be sure not to make any special requests i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere be sure not to get anything other than bagels ... the turkey burgers are scary the worst excuse for japanese food i ve ever encountered . the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water . the sushi was awful the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard . furthermore the rice had no seasoning so the sushi was bland and disgusting . the fish was adequate but inexpertly sliced . it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine . good fast service . i would highly recommend . food is great and inexpensive . the location is perfect . give it a try and enjoy . i thought going to jimmys would give me a real domincan exprience . jimmy is dominican well this place is so ghetto its not even funny . if you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least dollar bottle minimun then you ll love it here . would never go back there . too bad latin quarters closed . that place was awesome sally awsome pizza especially the margheritta slice . always busy but fast moving . great atmoshere and worth every bit . open late lrb well as late as i ever got there and i m a night person rrb . winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you . the food is reliable and the price is moderate . what more can you ask for for authentic thai food look no further than toons . ive been to many thai restaurants in manhattan before and toons is by far the best thai food ive had lrb except for my mom s of course rrb . try the pad thai or sample anything on the appetizer menu ... they re all delicious . everything about this restaurant was special . the service was attentive yet discreet . the flavors robust and subtle . the brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal . i m saving up for my next visit . i went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date . the place was quiet and delightful . service was good and food is wonderful . i did not try the caviar but i tried their salmon and crab salad lrb they are all good rrb . it is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat . as a retired hipster i can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year lucky strike has been the best laidback late night in the city . the wait staff is pleasant fun and for the most part gorgeous lrb in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way not in that she swaycuterthanmethatb@#$* way rrb . the food is yummy especially their cookedtoperfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries . but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere delightfully free of the bts . you can get a completely delish martini in a glass lrb that s about drinks rrb for $ lrb i recommend the vanilla shanty mmmm ... rrb in a great homey setting with great music . the inhouse lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music and moreover takes requests . you ca n t go wrong with this place . suan is a great place that i often take my friends lrb classmates rrb too . its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable makes students go back to suan again and again . i love their thai . noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must i was in love with pongsri on but compared to suan it is slow in service and overpriced . i will go back to suan soon in summereat outside on a terrace lrb another great feature of suan rrb i can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant . i can not imagine better indian food in all of the city . i can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there . this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location . during the course of the past months the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better . i wish they would change back to what it was before . the food now is inconsistent . this is the kind of place you d like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret . the setting is casual and romantic . prices are very good . the food is excellent if you re daring try the balsamic vinegar over icecream it s wonderful do not get the go go hamburgers no matter what the reviews say . they were such a ripoff lrb $ for four small meat patties in steamed buns rrb and not worth trying . the rest of the dim sum though pricey by chinatown standards is worth it . steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table . the wait here is long for dim sum but if you do n t like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig this is a sleek lrb for chinatown rrb alternative . a few tips skip the turnip cake roast pork buns and egg custards . these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner . lrb rrb turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of mott st. just south of bayard . lrb rrb egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of mott street just south of canal . after passing by this restaurant for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner . i was pleasantly suprised . the food was exceptional . the menu consisted of standard brassiere food better then places like balthazar etc. . i choose to go with one of the special the braised lamb shank in red wine which was excellent . the service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual . the restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal . this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices . the pad se ew chicken was delicious however the pad thai was far too oily . i would just ask for no oil next time . have eaten at ginger house several times and it s always good . the fried dumplings are great finally a reliable chinese restaurant this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service . the only thing you can do here is walk in and eat ... but planning an event especially a small intimate one forget about it . they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place but also become hostile nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end not one person takes responsibility for anything . terrible terrible management deserves to be shutdown . never fails to please . delicious bagels especially when right out of the oven . spreads and toppings are great though a bit pricey . service is fast and friendly . only drawback they wo n t toast your bagel and they do n t make eggs for the bagel . but that is highly forgivable . been there done that and new york it s not that big a deal . the food is decent at best and the ambience well it s a matter of opinion some may consider it to be a sweet thing i thought it was just annoying . if celebrities make you sweat then your in for a ride but if your like most around these parts then you ll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype . rao is a good restaurant but it s nothing special . i ve eaten at many different indian restaurants . but after last night spice grill is the only place i m eating indian cuisine . you must try the shrimp appetizers . even my indian friend could n t believe how good and tasty everything was . this place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time . great food great prices great service . if you are looking for a good quality cheap eats this is the place . it s a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food . i really loved the different and inovated touch that s the cheff gives to the food . also it s great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place the service it s just perfect ... they re so frendly that we never want to live the place i love essabagel but i live on the west side so i often go to murray s for convenience . their bagels are fine but they are a little overcooked and not really a ` special bagel experience . better than the bagel shop on the corner but not worth going out of your way for in my opinion . also a little more expensive than your average bagel place . great bagels made the oldfashioned way . the appetizing is excellent just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price lrb if bought by the pound rrb . drawbacks service is slow and they do n t toast the food was absolutely amazing the baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we ve ever had the lamb was tender so full of flavor the dessert was divine the waiter was attentive . the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening . downtown dinner prixe fix appetizers were ok waiter gave me poor suggestion ... try the potato stuff kanish best one . small servings for main entree i had salmon lrb wasnt impressed rrb girlfriend had chicken it was good . dessert is a joke ... dont bother . volare virgins or weekly regulars everyone gets treated the same and you ca n t ask for more than that when the service is this friendly . the restaurant has a family feel not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have singlehandedly solved third world famine . the antipasta was excellent especially the calamari as were the filling pasta mains . the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal . still any quibbles about the bill were offset by the pouryourown measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ... . fantastic place . cute and decorative . a pleasant surprise . go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else . lucky strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat . yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously but it should n t . great food great decor great service . i recommend it just ignore the trendy wannabes . this is the perfect spot for meeting friends having lunch dinner pretheatre or aftertheatre drinks lrb always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer guaranteed to be a tasty experience rrb excellent spot for holiday get togethers with coworkers or friends that you have n t seen in a while . i have been doing all of the above at the heartland brewery for over years now and i have never been disappointed all the people that i bring there go back on their own and bring their friends go there once and oh yes ... you will go back ... you will ... . what a great place not the typical nyc gimmick theme restaurant . a cool bar with great food and tons of excellent beer . and even with it s pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too loved it out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens this is among the best . the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful . it is expensive but well worth the money . if you venture off the island of manhattan and ca n t seem to find a great italian restaurant drive to corona . the only thing more wonderful than the food lrb which is exceptional rrb is the service . the only thing the waiters do n t do for you is wipe your chin when you leave . wonderful at holiday time . cozy romantic atomosphere with only around tables at most . service was very prompt but slightly rushed . food was very good but not what i would consider out of this world . go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience . my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian . too bad the food was n t of the same heritage . the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless so was the seafood tagliatelle . a real dissapointment . but that was n t the icing on the cake a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had . they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chipsgood but a far cry from what the name implies . priced at upper intermediate range . i really liked this place . everything i had was good and i m a eater . it was pretty inexpensive too . this place has the best chinese style bbq ribs in the city . i also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee lrb rice porridge rrb . it s great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend . it s definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone . however if you want great food at a great price and do n t mind the decor you ca n t beat this place . quick and friendly service . this is one of the best comfort food places in the city . it s somewhere you can eat and be happy . when i m feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office i head for cafe st. bart s . when you re sitting in their main dining room lrb which has a spectacular handpainted high ceiling rrb you d never know there was a world outside . the food is wonderful tasty and filling and the service is professional and friendly . i ca n t wait for summer when they serve outside on their gigantic patio . ahhh ... . i recently tried suan and i thought that it was great . this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money . the service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals . i have to say that i am pleasantly suprised and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neighborhood . they all know you . good food . good drink . how do you rate home i have never had cheescake like this . i thought i had died and gone to heaven . great spot whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner . warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months . the food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices . have been several times and it never dissapoints . after hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant and passing by it on a daily basis we decided to try . we were less than impressed . while the ambiance and atmosphere were great the food and service could have been a lot better . we ordered the chicken casserole but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken all dark meat and on the bone . probably would not go again ... . i ve been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine if not good . stick with the chicken beef and lamb dishes . i do n t usually order wine with indian so i ca n t comment on their wine list or their wines . instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian . service is friendly and never had a problem walking in and getting a table . i would recommend reservations on weekends though . skip dessert . best reuben sandwich ever a classic do n t miss bloom s on your next trip to manhatten . it was the first place we ate on our first trip to new york and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to new york . thanks bloom s for a lovely trip . as a fan of thai i have tried quite a few different restaurants in nyc and this one was definitely the worst . the food was not fresh the sauces were bland and very oily . it just was n t thai . went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza lrb as i love la pizza fresca rrb . was surprisingly disappointed . pizza was a little soggy . ravioli was good ... but i have to say that i found everything a bit overpriced . not enough wines by the glass either . service however was excellent ... and i liked the setting/atmosphere a lot . food was just average ... if they lowered the prices just a bit it would be a bigger draw . this place is a great bargain . authentic pakistani food . people are always friendly . do n t waste money on decor . just straight up cheap good food . faan is sooo good . the best pad thai i ve ever had . the design and atmosphere is just as good . bottles of wine are cheap and good . what more could you want the food was actually aweful . i m not picky but it was actually gross . the mussles were the fishiest things i ve ever tasted the seabass was bland the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese the penne w / chicken had bones in it ... it was disgusting . nice atmosphere the service was very pleasant and the desert was good . would n t recomend it for dinner this is the perfect date spot for williamsburg couples . the jukebox plays everything from italian opera to the strokes . the food is amazing rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza . best of all is the warm vibe the owner is super friendly and service is fast . if only they delivered they d make a mint go here for the drinks especially during happy hour enough said the drinks are amazing and half off till . ask for usha the nicest bartender in manhattan . my fav was the sassy lassi ... . this is an amazing place to try some roti rolls . i really recommend the very simple unda lrb egg rrb rolls . delicate spices onions eggs and a kickass roti . amazing toons has recently been redone so it s now a very attractive space . the food s as good as ever . in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food this is one of the best spots . went here last night nice decor good service but the food was surprisingly excellent . the portions are huge so it might be good to order three things to split lrb rather than one appetizer and entree per person rrb for two people . among all of the new avenue restaurants this offers by far one of the best values for your money . ca n t wait to go back . best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town beef noodle soup is good as well . the service is good and the resturant is clean . best taiwanese food in ny i have been to rao s probably times the past years and it keeps getting better . for those that go once and do n t enjoy it all i can say is that they just do n t get it . rao s has the best service and atmosphere in nyc . good luck getting a table . my roommate and i love this place . we recently decided to try this location and to our delight they have outdoor seating perfect since i had my yorkie with me . indoor was very cozy and cute . the portion sizes here are huge and the sushi is good . while it s not nobu it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full . staff is very accomodating . excellent dumplings served amid clean chic decor . i got the $ dim sum combo every bite of which was great . but $ for each small piece not worth it . i wo n t go back unless someone else is footing the bill . i came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend . the decor is very simple but comfortable . the food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach . the portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that . you must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert . the staff there is very attentive and down to earth . i loved it and would go again . great indian food and the service is incredible . the owner truly caters to all your needs . when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets and then ordered for them . everyone was more then happy with his choices . great food and the prices are very reasonable . obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong it actually means great prosperity . the food here does a great service to the name lrb cantonese that is ... rrb . i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork . this dish is my favorite and i always get it when i go there and never get tired of it . try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh a delicious and sweet tasting bread . simply some good tasting chinese food at incredible prices ... . service is not what you are coming here for ... . just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that s all the service i need ... . big wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach . this place ... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend . whoever the jazz duo was they were on point . good music great food speedy service affordable prices . even the wine by the glass was good . its a little out of the way if you do n t live in the neighborhood but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are . consistently good japanese tapas . same owner as the guy who owns typhoon which is just down the street on st. marks and ave. . always good drinks and service is pretty good ; . atmosphere is nice and relaxed too ... . a great place to meet up for some food and drinks ... . yakitori lrb bbq meats rrb is tasty too . it s also attached to angel s share which is a cool more romantic bar ... . just moved to the neighborhood and we ve been trying all the west village sushi restaurants . if you do n t mind presliced low quality fish unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place . price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit . was n t going to share but i feel obligated ... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing . no thanks this place which is only a few months old is perhaps queens biggest secret fabulous decor makes you feel like you re in a trendy manhattan restaurant very very good food cheaplypriced generally friendly staff and if you re a manhattanite or spend most of your time in manhattan rice avenue will make you feel at home ... very soho/village/upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ... all on roosevelt avenue we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date . we were then shooed inside . one would think we d get an apology or complimentary drinks instead we got a snobby waiter would n t even take our order for minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so . we left never to return . with so many good restaurants on the uws i do n t need overpriced food absurdly arrogant waitstaff who do n t recognize they work at a glorified diner clumsy service and management that does n t care . i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bgel on and was disappointed with the service and i thought the food was overated and on the pricey side . if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on street which is blocks away on ave. . great bagels spreads and a good place to hang out in . you fellas above says its the best taiwanese restaurant in town . however it is the only taiwanese restaurant in town . the food is okay and the prices here are mediocre . you ca n t say its cheap because food is cheaper in chinatown . they re are better taiwanese restaurants and they are located in flushing queens . baluchi s has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices . the only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent . he offers subpar service and has no personality . in fact it appears he is going to go postal at any moment . skip this location and go to the one in soho . there is no excuse for such lousy service i have never before eaten pieces of relatively good nigiri . stuffing yourself with japanese food is a rare thing . you can do it here . $ for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten . i went to areo on a sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends and spent three enjoyable hours there . the restaurant was packed at first so we waited at the bar for about minutes before we were seated . most of the servers are very attentive friendly and quite attractive . the atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd but there were a few groups of mid s / year olds also . the vibe is very relaxed and cozy service was great and the food was excellent me and my girls will definitely go back . food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when i went . i would highly recommand requesting a table by the window . although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat . i ve eaten at pizza gruppo a few times but more often i order delivery . the food is great . personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights . i heartily recommend . there is a downside if you re ordering in the delivery guys have major attitude . never have i had such dramatic delivery guys lrb a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c i live in a walkup rrb who always seem disappointed with their tips . hey i think $ for a block walk ai n t bad . love the scene first off the place has a character and nice light to it ... very fortunate location wise . the pizza was pretty good and huge . the price very reasonable . we were and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally . we got most of it back at home with us . i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n t not mention or undermine . the pasta penne was pretty extra buttery creamy which means a big task to diggest ... tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and to count penne ... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed ... lol . no really . i have eaten a lot of pizza here . la rosa waltzes in and i think they are doing it the best . interesting selection good wines service fine fun decor . i have been twice to this restaurant . i love it . i plan on stopping by next week as well . i found it on a cold night the perfect spot to warm up . i recieved prompt service with a smile . to me it exemplifies soho cute artsy interesting . definately check it out this place blew me away ... by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side . the wine list is extensive and impressive . love the atmosphere felt like i was in paris . the mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert ... definitely going to be back very soon . i just read mocaramel s review and felt compelled to respond . i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna . over the years the host vittorio and his crew have always treated me as family although with all the business this notsolittle gem does it amazing he s even able to remember a consistent but notsofrequent visitor . i ve also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years a new jazz bar the most fantastic dining garden the best thin crust pizzas and now a lasagna menu which is to die for lrb these are not your average lasagnas rrb i love this place keep up the good work guys my girlfiends and i ate at o.g. again last night . i have to say i have never had a disapointing meal here . we could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu . luckily we saved room for the bbq salmon sea bass and crispy duck . we got a little tipsy from the sake but is n t that what saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about love al di la . i recommend this place to everyone . great food . one of my favorite places in brooklyn . the pastas are incredible the risottos lrb particularly the sepia rrb are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing . overpriced and not tasty . the food here was mediocre at best . it was totally overpriced fish and chips was about $ ... . there are so many other great places to go to eat and drink ... this place is not worth it ... . tasty dog an awesome organic dog and a conscious eco friendly establishment . one of the best hot dogs i have ever eaten . ca n t wait to go back . the cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it . but the best pork souvlaki i ever had is the main thing . trust me . run do n t walk . super yummy pizza i was visiting new york city with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant . i looove their eggplant pizza as well as their pastas we had half/half pizza mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza we had fun eating in there we were there like around a.m. in the morning will comeback for sure wish they have it here in la. . excellent food although the interior could use some help . the space kind of feels like an alice in wonderland setting without it trying to be that . i paid just about $ for a good meal though rrb . great sake reliable fresh sushi . my husband and i take out from here times a month . the sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious . have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once . delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week . delivery guy sometimes get upset if you do n t tip more than . we ve found it to be better and fresher than kiku which is comparable in price . best ... sushi ... ever . this place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi . creative consistent fresh . excellent sashimi and the millennium roll is beyond delicious . not cheap but very yummy . love it . very very nice . the place is a bit hidden away but once you get there it s all worth it . not only is the food . loved it . my wife and i went to water s edge for a romantic dinner . we had a very nice time . the waiter was attentive the food was delicious and the views of the city were great . i d definitely go back again . great place to relax and enjoy your dinner . there is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week . place is open till late no dress code . good food my favorite is the seafood spaghetti . highly recommended excellent food for great prices . my husband and i have been sold on this from the first visit . the wait staff is very courteous and accomodating . the space is limited so be prepared to wait up to minutes hour but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indochinese food . there are no negatives to speak of . the bestt my favorite place lol . i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good . its alright . im not necessarily fanatical about this place but it was a fun time for low pirces . lobster was good nothing spectacular . its just a fun place to go not a five star restaraunt . way below average . i think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked . had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive . would never go back . i love this place . i was n t here for the pizza so i ca n t comment on that yet but what i had was very good . the service was quick and friendly . everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome . i thought the restaurant was nice and clean . i ordered the vitello alla marsala and i was pretty impressed . the veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly . the potato balls were not dry at all ... in fact it was buttery . the only downside ... they only take cash which is ok if you know about it ahead of time . i ll be back for sure . worst place on smith street in brooklyn . very immature bartender didnt know how to make specific drinks service was so slowwwww the food was not fresh or warm waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers . i would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner . awesome . the food is always fresh ... . overpriced japanese food with mediocre service . went here on sat and was disappointed . chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top food was luke warm . the waitress was not attentive at all . i was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have . too many other good places to have to settle . not because you are `` the four seasons ... you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner . the food was excellent as well as service however i left the four seasons very dissappointed . i do not think dinner in manhattan should cost $ where i am not swept off my feet . red dragon roll my favorite thing to eat of any food group hands down . just go to yamato and order the red dragon roll . if you do n t like it i do n t know what to tell you . the seafood dynamite is also otherworldly . i m not even going to bother to describe it ; it speaks for itself . favorite sushi in nyc . i have eaten at some of the ` best sushi joints in nyc lrb nobu bond street jewelbako etc rrb and yamato is my favorite . an unpretentious spot in park slope the sushi is consistently good the service is pleasant effective and unassuming . in the summer months the back garden area is really nice . the rolls are creative and i have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food . the dancing white river and millenium rolls are musts . so good . i can eat here every day of the week really lol love this place ... rrb . gross food wow . i ca n t remember the last time i had such gross food in new york . my quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a threeyear old with no sense of proportion or flavor . and $ for a plate of bland guacamole come on . do n t get me started on the margaritas either . mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila . really i find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds this in the city of a million restaurants at least of which are way better than this one . save your money and your time and go somewhere else . oh and i never write reviews i just was so moved by how bad this place was i felt it was my duty to spread the word . great indian food this place was reccomended to me by a friend . when i got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly . the food was good the place was clean and affordable . i noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place this is one of my favorite spot very relaxing the food is great all the times celebrated my engagement and my wedding here it was very well organized . the staff is very good . love their drink menu . i highly recommend this beautiful place . nice for one time special occasion . went for mom s birthday brunch/lunch . they honored reservation on sunday afternoon very well . be aware . we were offered water for the table but were not told the voss bottles of water were $ a piece . food was ok . nice view of river and nyc . i come here enjoy very much with husband . remind me of home . great survice . mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm so delicious . a beautifully designed dreamy egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night . watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that s more lemony than smoky . oh and there s hookah . raymond the bartender rocks pacifico is a great place to casually hang out . the drinks are great especially when made by raymond . the omlette for brunch is great ... . the spinach is fresh definately not frozen ... . quacamole at pacifico is yummy as are the wings with chimmichuri . a weakness is the chicken in the salads . it s just average just shredded no seasoning on it . also i personally was n t a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole . overall decent food at a good price with friendly people . best indian restaurant in the city . decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york . small bright and clean bz grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints both in astoria and out . what really makes it shine is the food which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices and all made inhouse lrb even the gyro meat and sausages rrb and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected . all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent but the gyro is the reason to come if you do n t eat one your trip was wasted . best restaurant in brooklyn . the best great food amazing service this place is a class act . the veal was incredible last night . fresh mind blowing flavors . this place is a must visit you want to have a real hot dog in brooklyn skip nathan s ... you can get that at the mall ... go to bark . delicious creative and fun . got a date ... go here every time i have a special occasion with my boyfriend i have a hard time going anywhere else . it is so romantic . its dark and cozy ... there is always jazz music playing when we go . most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like ` that couple . the food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together . i ve enjoyed of the dishes we ve ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional tooauthenticforme dish lrb i m a daring eater but not that daring rrb . once you try it for a special occasion beware ... you ca n t stop you ll be ther for every anniversary birthday valentines day ... . for a fabulous wedding my daughter s wedding reception at water s edge received the highest compliments from our guests . everyone raved about the atmosphere lrb elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views rrb and the fabulous food service was wonderful ; . everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful . paul the maitre d was totally professional and always on top of things . thank you everyone at water s edge . ruth mother of the bride . would not go back . service ok but unfriendly filthy bathroom . the high prices you re going to pay is for the view not for the food . the bar drinks were eh ok to say the least . the stuff tilapia was horrid ... tasted like cardboard . we thought the dessert would be better wrong $ down the toilet ... . oh speaking of bathroom the mens bathroom was disgusting . the floor was wet the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor no soap and no hand towels left . go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead . good experience . during our trip to nyc we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the four seasons for their pretheater menu lrb offering a modified menu for $ pp rrb . the wine list was extensive though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings . the bread we received was horrible rock hard and cold and the `` free appetizer of olives was disappointing . however our main course was wonderful . i had fish and my husband had the filet both of which exceeded our expectations . the dessert lrb we had a pear torte rrb was good but once again the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions . when we inquired about ports the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost . not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this location . all in all i would return as it was a beautiful restaurant but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future . short and sweet seating is great it s romantic cozy and private . the boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they re perfect for people . the service was extremely fast and attentive lrb thanks to the service button on your table rrb but i barely understood word when the waiter took our order . the food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy . over . over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals . so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food . will probably not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once . impressed ... . subtle food and service . noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food i enjoy . servers are all different greg is my favorite . sometimes tables do n t understand his sense of humor but it s refreshing to have a server who has personality professionalism and respects the privacy of your dinner . this is the first place i ve been that a runner remembers my order ... hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant . prices are fair across the board for both food and bev . i go out to eat and like my courses servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink . restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place . amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings this place had all the trimmings and i mean all . peppers onions relish chilli cheeses you name it . amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place out best dining experience in the west village stepping into casa la femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in new york highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night i had the have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for food took some time to prepare all worth waiting for . we were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd . i never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending great find in the west village maggot in the food i ve been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table . the menu looked great and the waiter was very nice but when the food came it was average . nevertheless i finished my plate and that s when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom . i showed it to the manager and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts lrb but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for rrb . when the bill came nothing was comped so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine but i did n t think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it . yes i ate the food but i certainly would not have if i had seen the maggot before eating and i was at this point fairly sick to my stomach . the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine lrb which cost less than the food rrb and made it seem like a big concession . we paid and left because we did n t feel like arguing any more . i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food . for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service . a fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes flatbush farm is n t in the same league as the blue hills or even the farm on adderlys of the world but it s pretty good albeit with a somewhat dismal setting . unhygienic . i do not recommend . i went there . i got hair in my food times of then great place great value . the food is flavorful plentiful and reasonably priced . the atmosphere is relaxed and casual . it s a great place to order from or sitin . awesome . inexpensive unassuming great time sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance . try it very pleased . good creative rolls yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much . they have great rolls the triple color and norwegetan rolls are awesome and filling . one special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up but save room for dessert they have a delicious banana chocolate dessert as well as a great green tea tempura . the appetizers are also delicious amazing food . mazing interior . great food i ve had my fair share of modern japanese and this spot delivers . the atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors . if you re into being lost when you re just five feet from your table then hey that s a good thing . despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my goto for modern japanese food for the foreseeable future . another review here claimed the prefix was $ person including sake but it is $ per person not including sake . indo chinese food pretty good ... . not a very fancy place but very good chinese style indian food . the chicken lollipop is my favorite most of the dishes lrb i have to agree with a previous reviewer rrb are quite oily and very spicy espeically the chilli chicken . my mom originally introduced me to this place but even she lrb being indian rrb feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily . still we keep going back rrb . i was speechless by the horrible food . i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant and the food was majorly disappointing . rather than eating the meat entree being offered i requested a vegetarian dish . rather than preparing vegetarian dish the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables lrb minus sauce seasoning or any form or aesthetic presentation rrb . i was so stunned and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing . this place survives on reputation alone . i will never return . best in all of nyc . this is the most wonderful restaurant in all of new york city not just brooklyn ... . for years they have put out the most tasty most delicious food and kept it that way ... . never swaying never a bad meal never bad service ... . i m telling you ... . you should travel from the bronx to try it ... . great food great wine list great service in a great neighborhood ... . so delicious patsy s pizza = true love . hands down the best pizza on the planet . my bf and i go to the walkup counter and order a pie . in about minutes the thing is gone . need i say more great hot dogs ... . the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside . great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost great taste . great original taste . for me dishes a little oily but overall dining experience good . helpful service and average price per dish $ . the only thing that strikes you is the decor lrb not very pleasant rrb . great food . this place has great indian chinese food . the flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal . be prepared to wait because the place is pretty tiny . also they do not take credit card so come with cash even though the place is not beautiful the food speaks for itself . best indian chinese in the city by far amazing my favorite i have been living in nyc for bit now and i have to say i love to go out and explore the scene . i came across village underground by accident now i go there all the time . the martinis are amazing and very fairly priced . the service is amazing i ve had different waiters and they were all nice which is a rare thing in nyc . the dj is awesome i have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and i keep going back . you can get a table without a reservation if you get there early i they do n t make you by bottles . which lets face it ... at times it s a good thing . in the end you end up with a fair tab and nothing but a great time highly recommended one of the best if not the best restaurants in park slope lrb and ny in general rrb . everything on the menu is great . this establishment is the real deal . wish ny had more of these kind of places intimate superb food homey top notch all the way around certainly worth the wait . there is `` expensivebutworthit and there is `` expensiveandwtf this is a twentysomething guy that does n t mind laying down $ for a fine and delicious meal for on special occassions . but $ for a dinner for two that did n t include wine are you freaking kidding me look the appetizers were really good . the entree was also very good . ca n t argue about that but they are clearly over priced . what you are paying for is the environment and the name . yes the place is classy and beautiful but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while . $ included . drinks glasses of dom perignon at $ each . starters kobe beef sashimi . which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef . surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe . a beef consomme . entrees vanison steak and bison steak . vanison was good but not amazing . bison was quite excellent however . dessert pure disaster . just not good at all . some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all . i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself but may be it is worth it . i was wrong . the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants but trust me they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say `` i ve been to the four seasons restaurant . i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it . all in all the food was great lrb except for the dessserts rrb . the environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts . if you are going for the food it will not be worth it . yes it is good but i ve had better for cheaper . you would think they would make up for it with service sadly no . service was just ok it is not what you d expect for $ . terrible waste of money ... scammers . i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience but not in a good way . i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience . i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time . we went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different . our visit their to say the least was an unpleasant and costly experience and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience . we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table . although we were told minutes and it was more like minutes . we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited . the place is beautiful the hostess was very pleasant . however our $ drinks were were horrible once we finally got a table despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed since we were already waiting so long we felt we had no other choice but to accept it . our experience did not ever get any better . for each course we waited over hour to minutes and were never offered a drink . we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka . after the time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner . we asked for beverages and never received them . we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order . my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin . i would not expect this for a $ dinner . by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka what we did do was waste hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka ... some of which we never received the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses to top it all off ... the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant . by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused and wasted my hard earned money . my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly i wish i could be refunded do n t go with a larger group than i went here for a family birthday dinner . five of us walked in at approximately on a thursday evening . the hostess said `` wow that s a large group unless you are n t together to which i replied `` no we are and there will be one more so a table for six please . at first we were a little taken aback as this seemed to present a problem although the restaurant looked fairly empty but they hastily put the table together for us . the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions . there was no tap beer that evening which was a disappointment . not much of a selection of bottled beer either we went with brahma . the appetizers we ordered were served quickly an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion lrb maybe of each rrb . the lobster knuckles lrb special of the day rrb were ok but pretty tasteless . i believe there were shrimp in the `` salt encrusted shrimp appetizer . after we ate our appetizers lrb which took all of minutes rrb we ordered another round of brahma s and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member . the waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order . we replied that we would like to wait more minutes if that was okay . she replied `` well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now since you are a larger party and it might get crowded . we called the other person who was very close by and she told us to order for her so we did . the food arrived in about minutes . i had the thai style fried sea bass ... which was very good . everyone seemed generally happy with their food except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice i heard the lobster roll was excellent . they seemed to continue to rush us along taking plates without asking if we were done lrb my sister still had her fork in hand rrb . all in all the food was good a little on the expensive side but fresh . service not the friendliest to our `` large party probably would not go back here . great indian food . i lived on st and wanted indian one day so decided to check this place out . food was amazing i love indian food and eat it quite regularly but i can say this is one of the best i ve had . very `` normal indian food but done really well . i have it a instead of because of the price lrb just chicken tikka masala no bread of rice is $ rrb which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place does n t have an upscale feel . also waiters try to push more food on you like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ . i do n t appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron s knowledge so that was a huge turnoff lrb more than the price rrb . but if you re prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary then this is the place to go for indian food . one of the best . bukhara grill the tagline says it all ... `` indian spice rave . my gf and i dine at bukhara often as she lives near it . the lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it . we go often for lunch and the place is packed . we have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given . bukhara is on my top indian places in nyc . wretched and retching . this will be only the third online review i have ever made about a restaurant in my life . they have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant . i have never been so disgusted by both food an service . for starters they delivered us someone else s order . fine i wont hang you for that . however once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair lrb sometimes you have to settle when it s your only option rrb i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting slimy clearly bad piece of fish skin . not one to jump to complaints lrb hence my lack of previous online reviewing rrb i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations . my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation . none was made so i hung up . less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet . my girlfriend being slightly more aggressive and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant . not only have i worked in restaurants for many years i am now in culinary school i am a huge lover of oysters and fish and my girlfriend is half korean we know the difference between and oyster and bad fish . it was n t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand but now it s simply repulsive . eat at your own risk . gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner . i took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night . i book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot . the service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing i completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date . more williamsburg garbage . my wife and i visited dokebi tonight . we ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgibokum . the dishes came out around minutes apart . the bibimbap was average but the stone bowl was n t even close to sizzling . too bad i had paid an extra $ for the stone bowl . the nakgibokum was horrible . easily the worst stirfried squid i ve ever tasted . the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean . the side dishes were passable and i did get a refill upon request . the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service . i mentioned the squid dish was n t very good when the waitress visited . she just nodded and walked off . there were no communications issues either as she spoke perfect english . as to my comment about the food no apology or acknowledgment was made . my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish . we were charged full price . if you ware looking for korean fusion i suggest you try some of the places in the east village . authentic korean food lovers should visit street of course . lives up to the hype . we ve lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there . we ve tried before but it always packed and does n t take reservations . it was well worth the wait . the wife had the risotto which was amazing . it does n t look appetizing as it s covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black but the taste was phenomenal . the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty . i love margherita pizza i looove east village pizza . love this place every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go . a quintessential slice of nyc pizza . the crust has a great bite and a good chew the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it the salt from the cheese is great really heightens the flavor of all the other components . personally i like the margherita pizza better but they are all good . possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city . this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie lrb that do n t serve sushi rrb and in my opinion one of the most romantic restaurants in the city not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot once you enter the unmarked wooden doors the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you re no longer in the city . if you re planning to come here make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching lrb choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky rrb it s just you and your date and an occasional cute ` excuse me before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth my party had the bbe $ fixe prix menu which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it . we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche . our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce . i picked the grilled black cod as my entree which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better . the entrees were served with miso soup and rice . the sake s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world . for desserts we tried the frozen black sesame mousse lrb interesting but not extraordinary rrb and matcha lrb powdered green tea rrb and blueberry cheesecake which was phenomenal . maybe it was the great company lrb i had friends visiting from philly yes it was not a date this time rrb or the super reasonable price point but i just ca n t say enough good things about this brasserie . i do n t usually visit the same establishment more than once what more twice but i ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet unhurried and memorable dinner . terrible would be a compliment the service leaves much to be desired from feeling like you are rushed the place your order to being ignored the rest of the night . we were people celebrtating a birthday we sat in the tent . we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing we never ate because by close to in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating . they are extremely rude not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ for some drinks adn their pita bread stay away . great shabu shabu . i go here at least once every other week particularly when it s cold i love it . to be honest we only ever eat the shabu shabu . i tried a couple other dishes but was n t too impressed . but for the shabu shabu you wo n t find much better in ny . in fact there is only one i ve tried that even compares lrb shabu tatsu rrb and even then i prefer dokebi . the meat is fresh the sauces are great you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too . dokebi gives williamsburg the right onetwo punch of classic korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos . the hot dogs are good yes but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich perfect on its supermarket squishy bun . restaurant with a view . celebrated my fathers birthday here . the food tasted very good . the family seafood entree was very good . the main entree was also very good . we order a bit of everything on the menu . price is high but the food is good so i would come back again . this place does n t make any sense . just want to warn you all do n t waste your time and money . this place has totally weird decor stairs going up with mirrored walls i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ... . this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird . the concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n t work . the food they serve is not comforting not appetizing and uncooked . go to japanese sushi place or spanish tapas place this creation in williamsburg is a misstake . good food . i went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary . the food was great and tasty but the sitting space was too small i do n t like being cramp in a corner . over all it was a very nice romantic place . i would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation lrb if possible rrb . loved it . a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it . the atmosphere was great . the food we ordered was excellent although i would n t say the margaritas were anything to write home about . our waitress was n t mean but not especially warm or attentive either . i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year though . maybe it has improved since then regardless we ll be back and ca n t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio . dumbfoundingly poor . this was from start to finish a mindbogglingly uncomfortable experience . lexicographers take note a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn . the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention . polite acknowledgement is out ; . supercilious scorn is in . and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent a different server enhanced the fun dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer lrb which was delicious rrb . overall the food quality was pretty good though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n t sat cooling in front of the guest . the place has a nice fitout some attractive furnishings and from what i could tell a reasonable wine list lrb i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins rrb . at $ for two people however this in no way represents value unless you re looking to pay by the hour for passiveaggressive torture . on that scale it s a worldbeater . how is this palce still open i honestly do n t even know where to begin . my boyfriend and i are avid restaurant goers and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flatbush farms . we arrived and were seated immediately which made us both happy . we ordered our appetizers i ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon . everything was going good until we got our meals . i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled . it was served with skin over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes . my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead while he deskinned the chicken so that i could enjoy the white meat . i took one bite from the $ salmon and i have never in the years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy as dry and as bland as the one in flatbush farms . at this point the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n t say anything and guess what the waitress walked away . so i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it . i could n t even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . i ve had better chicken at bbqs so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible . guess what i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did she says `` oh well i wish you would have said something earlier no apology nothing . after that she simply took our plates walked away came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it no desert menu no apology nothing i was literally going to explode but instead my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager . this is where it really really gets bad the manager said there is absolutely nothing we can do it s a matter of taste that she did n t like it and i can not comp it . again no apology no is there anything else i can get you no can i get you a drink to make up for it nothing we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore . the level of rudeness was preposterous . the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want so we paid for what we did enjoy the drinks and appetizers and walked out . i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience . this staff should be fired . cirspy crust margherita pizza . we have been there times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes . it was really good pizza . the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded rrb rrb rrb . you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review . single worst restaurant in manhattan . i ll being with a couple of positives cool decor good pita and hummus and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty . moving on . if i could give stars i would do so for this place . casa la femme is to middle eastern dining what chuckie cheeze is to italian . the reason there are different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews . well ... they can run but they ca n t hide . i live in the west village and i ve been to a lot of restaurants . sometimes you pay a lot and do n t get much in return it s manhattan things are expensive . however most of them are at least prompt and pleasant . this place ... god where do i begin . it is quite a spectacular scene i ll give them that . the decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n t notice that you just payed bucks for some cold eggplant that took frickin hours to come how this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy or any other for that matter is beyond me . great hot dogs i ve made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby lrb i live on uws rrb . though it s been crowded most times i ve gone here bark always delivers on their food . the hot dogs are top notch and they re slamwich is amazing going to bark is always worth the train ride and will make your tongue and belly very happy only complaint is the pricing i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu . but nonetheless great spot great food . fabulous food if the front of house staff do n t put you off . we live nearby bfc . it s a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions but we ve eaten there times in the last years . each time we ve been the front of house staff lrb not the waiters they re fantastic but the people who greet and seat you rrb has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return . as bfc does n t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated which can be over an hour later the frizzy retro girl lrb with winged / dame edna glasses rrb will yell at you if you try to order a drink . i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at on a friday night because she `` had a bbq to go to that night wtf i d be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely there s another girl who i ca n t describe she is about with brown hair who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in except she only hears the last part of what you said so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you re * really * talking about . i m a friendly person so i would n t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal . again i d be super upset if that were my employee . considering you will spend at least $ a head i expect better service . so if you re walking by and thinking about dining you might want to see who s going to be seating you first ... . maitred `` eat and get out . my family ate here last weekend . the food and service were fine however the maitred was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant . while finishing our meals which included a highend bottle of wine our son s fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert . this guy refused to seat her and she left followed shortly by the four of us but not before i told him that in my years of world travel including paris that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant . his response was smug arrogant and condescending totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening . a word to the wise you ca n t dine here and disturb the maitred s sense of table turnover as whacked as it is or else . if you go here do it on his offnight . best meal in a long time mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening . i had the lamb special which was perfect . my father had the flank steak which was very good and my mother had the swordfish . the four seasons restaurant is a great experience . the food is great and the environment is even better . everyone must come here at least once . highly recommend it taking hot dogs to the next level . at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint but at bark you do n t just get your average hot dog . here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available . great atmosphere . went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal . i highly recommend the fish tacos everything else was ok . cool atmosphere the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night . poor service and management . do n t go to this place had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner . appetizers took nearly an hour . when the main course finally arrived lrb another rrb half of our order was missing . never got an explanation as to what was going on . the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly . when we threatened to leave we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing . on the way out we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues . ca n t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients . what a hassle the food is very good but not outstanding . there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table . on our last visit they skipped over our name on the list leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table . mistakes happen but they are usually accompanied by an apology perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff . without the wait or attitude i would probably go back but there are just too many other restaurants in brooklyn that are as good or better and do n t make me jump through hoops . expensive . i went there after hearing how great it was . wow . the bread was stale the salad was overpriced and empty . the pasta was well cooked did n t have enough sauce though or flavor . i though it was expensive and i prefer bella via just blocks away by far . so rude i went with jwils . her review is above . i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience . my friend is right in the experience we had . the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us . the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared . i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane . i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said `` can i help you and `` how many are in your party . what the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were . we did n t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem . shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and nonexistent customer service . bad staff . i generally like this place . the food is good . the design of the space is good . but the service is horrid i was there for brunch recently and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter . the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand . i ca n t believe that it was but please put the bag down before delivering food the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating lrb a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere so i try to ignore it rrb . i could n t ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends who was in mid bite to clear the table . she then put the check down without asking if we were done and came to check on the bill every two minutes even though we were one of three occupied tables . i wish i could like this place more and i wish someone would retrain the staff . yum serves really good sushi . not the biggest portions but adequate . green tea creme brulee is a must do n t leave the restaurant without it . no comparison . i ca n t say enough about this place . it has great sushi and even better service . the entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need . i ve been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date . snotty attitude . we were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast . the owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint . good food we love breakfast food . this is a great place to get a delicious meal . we never had to wait more than minutes . the staff is pretty friendly . the onion rings are great they are not greasy or anything . overrated . i was highly disappointed in the food at pagoda . the lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns the few they actually give you ... were not good . the prices are outrageous especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood chinese establishments . nice ambience but highly overrated place . i will not go back . worst service i ever had . a group of of us went there for sunday brunch and sat outside . everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received . our waiter was nonexistent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered we were not given any water or utensils . i complained to the manager but he was not even apologetic . i will never return again . fabulous italian food i highly recommend mioposto . i am so happy to have a wonderful italian restaurant in my neighborhood . the wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to italy . i love this restaurant . i will never forget the amazing meal service and ambiance i experience at this restaurant . it was absolutely amazing . the wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice good at their jobs and cultured . i have not a bad thing to say about this place . amazing . i can not wait to go back again this coming weekend mmm ... good went there last night with a friend . she had heard from a coworker about this place . the food was great it s * very * reasonably priced esp for the quality of the food . i had the kafta plate and it was perfect . we re going back d . finally a meal that you will remember for a long time in a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants its nice to see a place that bucks that trend and just plain delivers high quality food and good service period . this is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer . caution its real food for people who love the best . some of the food is clearly oriented toward foodies lrb like me rrb so if your not a foodie lrb nothing wrong with that rrb head over to mcdonalds or some ruby tuesday and have at it if your looking for real quality lrb not the bs that is seen on yelp ratings which allegedly recently got in trouble for `` adjusting ratings rrb you need to get in here very disappointing . i took my parents here for their anniversaryvery very disappointed i liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price . i may not be a sushi guru but i can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it . rice is too dry tuna was n t so fresh either . nothing really came across as outstanding . very disappointed . i have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent . however the value and service are both severely lacking . portions contain less fish than one would expect particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in nyc lrb masa excluded of course rrb . furthermore while the fish is unquestionably fresh rolls tend to be inexplicably bland . the service ranges from mediocre to offensive . on a recent trip our waiter was extremely dismissive while no less than three staff members waited handandfoot on a pair of japanese girls seated nearby . we were then charged for their most expensive sake lrb $ per serving rrb when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price . but im sure this was just an honest mistake ... . freshest sushi i love this restaurant . they pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls . the sashimi was the freshest and most tender i have ever tasted . their apps are all delicious . the only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side . but the space is small and lovely and the service is helpful . you are bound to have a very charming time . not recommanded the food was not great & the waiters were rude . it is not worth going at all and spend your money there great service . pretty cheap for sit down mexican and downtown . my service was stellar the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me . food was fine with a some littletastierthannormal salsa . if you re in the area you should n t be disappointed . ok ... maybe i went in on someone s bad day ... . the food was great the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me . took forever to get our order taken water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention . i do n t know if i ll be back ... . mama mia i live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place . the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it s edible even when you order ahead . but once done it s not too much dough not too much cheese not too much sauce . best sushi in town . have gone to all the top places . everything you want and more very fresh . its worth the wait especially since they ll give you a call when the table is ready . the best calamari in seattle ... and the best summertime deck experience they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the seattle evening weather . a perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year . endless fun awesome music great staff by far the best bar in the east village ... . i went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast every time `` is called the bartender buys everyone drinks been there lots since and its always a good time . great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks . definitely has one of the best jukebox s i ve seen in a long long time . i found a new home on second avenue where can i begin . i ca n t just go there and see for yourself . the food is great the bartenders go that extra mile . you need to watch your game they will have it on for you . the owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for . and the upstairs is a great place to hang out . not alot of smoking places left in new york but i have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city . kudos to these guys . i found a new home and just moved with a long lease . thank you . go beyond the california rolls ... . the sushi here is delicious they have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from ; atlantic or pacific . i ve had the jellyfish horse mackerel blue fin tuna and the sake ikura roll among others and they were all good . my only negative comment is that i wish the pieces were a little bigger . the decor is rustic traditional japanese . the crowd is mixed yuppies young and old . the service was courteous and attentive . mediocre food . we ate on the outside patio area for dinner on a saturday night . the outside patio area has an abbreviated menu . we ordered the marinated grapes buffalo style chicken wings and the turkey sandwich . my g/f and i both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price . we are locals and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably onetime customer tourists . service was decent . drinks were good . unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks i would n t recommend going here . you are likely to be disappointed . excellent food nice ambience fairly expensive . i loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi lrb big ones to a plate instead of or so little gnocchis rrb and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes . the ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in downtown disney . it was romantic and even nice even with my sister reminded me of italy and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a mediterrean villa . i recommend it for a night when you want to splurge lrb it was a bit expensive rrb best indian food in l.a. . i ve been to over a dozen indian places in l.a. and this is still my favorite . the best thing is the prices are also quite reasonable . the chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes . the chana masala lrb garbanzo beans rrb are also excellent . it s located in a strip mall near the beverly center not the greatest location but the food keeps me coming back for more . hidden little jem . tucked away over by the beverly center . never too crowded and always great service . i think i have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent . i can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma . you routinely see indian families and friends dining there which is always a good sign . i appreciate their delivery too . nice food but no spice i really enjoyed my meal here . i had yummy lamb korma saag paneer samosas naan etc. . the food was all good but it was way too mild . normally places ask how hot you want it but they did n t . i should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild . i will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches . the naan was some of the best i ve had and i really enjoyed the bhartha not too tomatoey . even the chickpeas which i normally find too dry were good . and they packaged everything nicely so it did n t spill . awesome find . i do n t understand how i was a stranger to this place for so long ... the fajita salad the colorado the fajitas everything is delicious . i love the warm & cosy environment . i just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party ca n t wait to celebrate my next birthday there . best restaurant in the world great decor great customer service friendly manager . first of all henrymillionare you dont know a thing about middle eastern food so dont talk . cry me a river stop complaining you obviously you have no taste in food . i am never disappointed with there food . the atmosphere is great . and all you other people that have a problem get some help . great lunch spot . great financial district mexican spot . always busy but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service . everything i ve had here is good taco salads burritos enchiladas i love this place . also have great margaritas you can order to go if you have to get back to the office too lebanese food yum i ve been to open sesame only once but i m still reeling from the experience the food is simply unforgettable i had the beef kabobs with a side of cucumber yogurt . the presentation of the food was an added bonus it looked just as great as it tasted my best friend had the chicken shawarma and she still raves about it being the best anywhere her sister had the baklava for dessert what a tastly flaky treat the staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful . go to open sesame holy hummus the food is here is incredible though the quality is inconsistent during lunch . dinners have always been excellent in terms of food quality . the open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given . the side of potatoes is to die for as is the labne lrb yogurt dip rrb . also they serve the best hummus in america with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil lrb which i believe is the traditional way rrb the only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service . there have been several occasions when we ve just not gotten some side dishes we ve ordered . however this place is a gem and i wo n t stop going back . great beer . my first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible we waited over minutes for our drinks and over hours for our food . i swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal . however one sunday afternoon my husband and i did go lrb although with my loud protests rrb and were pleasantly surprised . the band was very good and the service was attentive . outside in the area between the restaurant and the park children were running around while their parents sipped wine . we ordered a selection of the small plates and the shoe string onions goat cheese pizza grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good . it was like dining at a completely different restaurant . we have since returned and also had a great experience sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer lrb cold and good rrb . we did have the same waiter the second time so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good . sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun . seattle s best winelist . ray s lrb suprisingly rrb has the city s best & most diverse wine list . the sommelier is fantastic downtoearth & extremely knowlegable . i would go back for the wine experience alone . nice job not the place it once was . it is sad to see a place that was once `` the place to meet and eat for bfast or lunch now be the place that is a big `` dont bother . the food is not what it once was lrb potions have seriously seen downsizing rrb prices have gone up and the service is the worst i have experienced anywhere lrb including mainland europe rrb . what may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment . this establishment really made a marked decline after lrb and this is recurring story rrb the airing of food televisions `` diners driveins and dives hosted by guy fieri in which schooner or later was subject of . perhaps now scooner or later falls into the `` dive category . this is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat . i hope one day scooner or later returns to what it once was . untill this happens my advice is to stay away . open & cool place with the best pizza and coffee . mioposto has a very creative & delicious pizza menu . the coffe is very good too . great open and friendly ambience . this place is charming and relaxing . the servers behind the counter are always friendly and helpful . it reminds me of those great little restaurants in san francisco . it s a great place to enjoy food and meet friends . old reliable . after years in seattle ray s rates as the place we always go back to . great food spectacular location and friendly service keep us coming back year after year . enjoyed the food . first of all i am not from long beach . i was visiting socal a couple of months ago when the friend i was visiting decided to take me to this restaurant . lrb she was actually going to take me to another mediterranean restaurant right across the street but they were not open yet even though it was a few minutes past their opening time . rrb i liked it . food was good and cheap . i had the kafta plate and i enjoyed it . it was so much though that i could barely finish but i did since it was delicious . atmosphere was nice . service was kind of slow our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it was n t that busy . still i would recommend this place . btw i really like long beach . it was one of the few places in socal where you would actually walk around and not have to take a car . wow it cant get any better what else can you say nice people amazing food wow . great food with an awesome atmosphere eggs pancakes potatoes fresh fruit and yogurt everything they serve is delicious . the best place for a leisure sunday breakfast amidst yachts then take a stroll through the nearby farmer s market . great meal the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi this fish was perfect plus i am allergic to rice and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating did n t even bat an eye and the waiter suggested a perfect sake absolutely fabulous unbeatable sushi two thumbs up i love sushi and i have eaten it all over the world . this is right up there with places in tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned . melt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi and very tasty rolls too . be sure to try the oyster roll . splendid . how to describe the best sushi in nyc hmmmm delicious amazing fantastic suculent perfect nah all of the above . i ca n t saybenough good things about this restaurant and i ca n t wait for my next several visits . the best chuwam mushi i have ever had . perfect on a cold day . $ with tip . perfection . good sushi high price . one of the best sushi place in town . the house special roll is really good . on weekends you might have to wait for couple hours . however they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone . a cozy spot for . i ca n t believe murphy s has been around for over years amazing . that s a huge compliment especially in the fickled restaurant business ... enough already brunch at murphy s is to die for my specialty ... egg white omelet the food is always freshly prepared . it s the perfect spot for a romantic date for or a secret rendezvous save room for scrumptious desserts . the restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you wo n t forget i guarantee you wo n t be disappointed there s also valet parking . addicting best mexican place for lunch in the financial district . love the enchiladas and chicken soup and be sure to check out their specials . the cooks have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes . can get busy on fridays for a table but once seated the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly . i went there with a friend from out of town ... and we were both very impressed went on a monday night so there was no wait for a table . the sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick . the price was right too . the atmosphere was just okay . space was limited but the food made up for it . i d go back there in a heartbeat . should have gone to trader joe s and had frozen pizza lrb . my family went on a midweek evening to have dinner . the restaurant was full and there was a sign posted `` wait to be seated . well i guess it s hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff . we stood there for minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us . finally my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked `` are you waiting for a table once seated it took about minutes to finally get the meal . the prior reviews said kid friendly ... give me a break with two young children that is light years . the caesar salad i ordered had so much lemon i could n t eat it . the pizza was slightly reminescent of baker s beach pizza which occupied the the space years ago lrb a distant second rrb . it was decent but nothing exceptional . this establishment is consistent with my feelings of the rest of chow foods group . we used to frequent most of their restaurants but over the years each one has really been disapointing . i m a born and bred southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening . well i guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management to pay a visit to tutta bella in columbia city for some tips . great food better margaritas this is one of my top lunch spots huge portions fast service and amazing margaritas it gets really busy so get there on the early side so you can grab a seat if you do have to wait its not bad because the service is quick check out the art on the walls very colorful i love this place i have been eating at this place for over years now and i have never had one bad meal . i highly recommend this place to all that want to try indain food for the first time . the lunch menu is an awesome deal plenty of food trust me . fresh ingrediants and super tasty . the place is the next best thing to my moms cooking . best food phenominal service . for the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best nyc has to offer the fish is the freshest and the service is superb . not only can the selection be innovative but there s a nice balance of traditional sushi as well . the nicest waiters in town . way overrated this place is unbelievably overrated . if i want to stand in line on sunday for an hour to get average brunch food then i would put murphy s at the top of the list . the regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive . your a sushi fan you love expertly cut fish great sake a killer soho location and of course salmon tuna fluke yellow tail cod mackeral jellyfish sea urchin shrimp lobster sea bream trout milk fish blue fin tuna eel crab sardine monk fish roe scallop oysters and a varity of toro . there is only one place on the east coast that has it all plus a lot more . better than nobu tomoe taka yama sugiyama and the rest . bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world blue ribbon sushi . believe it baby cut to the chase this is amazing it s unpretentious and underground . it s fresh welcoming delicious and relaxing . hands down the best tuna i have ever had . blue ribbon lives up to it s fantastic reputation . i went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again . what a find well worth it . great value sushi with high quality & nice setting . good for late night dining lrb last minute planning rrb without reservations . try the chef s choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty . poor customer service / poor pizza . as with most restaurants in seattle mioposto s service was bad and the food was overpriced . i know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places but mioposto s pizza lacks quality and good taste . to be honest i ve had better frozen pizza . i m not kidding . the only positive thing about mioposto is the nice location . love it every time . i was frankly shocked when i read the bad reviews this place is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way and we ve eaten here more than times . people complain about the dim lighting but that is one what i love about this place if you want to stare at your food in bright light go to mcdonalds . the food is fantastic and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we ve been there . the only problem would be the wait but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting . never had one single problem there . seafood plus . this was great dining experience . if you re going to see danny gans or just staying at the mirage do n t miss this one . the appetizer of oysters lobster crab lrb small size rrb made a perfect entre for my wife . seabass on lobster risotto was the best . caesar salad was superb . great bottle of wine . leave room for dessert . completely over rated i will have to do more research before checking out new places based on diners driveins and dives reviews . i noice most reviews mention the bad service . the food was ok but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served . even then the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items . we had a very hard time getting the waitress attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager . as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token discount on our bill . when the bill came he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks . it was clear he did n t really care . with so many great breakfast/lunch places in so cal this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit . avoid the place . save yourself the waste of time & do not visit . i made my trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online . when i got there i sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible i waited for minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again . after sitting there with my empty glass for over minutes i left . i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n t work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link . i never heard back from anyone more than a month ago . after telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar . after sitting at the bar for over minutes the bar keep had made only drinks & kept telling us she d be right with us . we left without ever getting service . as of writing this i just tried their give away a link again & it still does n t work . there are so many better places to visit best crab cakes in town . thats a big statement considering i ve been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since i was about seven but something about these little devils gets better every time . if you can come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening . great seasonal fish and seafood with a classy waterfront setting . always a winner . great pizza poor service . love their pizza especially the mushroom pizza . also love their caeser salad . prefer to order it and pick it up though because i do n t like the servers one young woman in particular . she does n t make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance . but she is very friendly with certain people making it even more annoying . management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners . many people talk about the great pizza and poor service so it ca n t just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers . it s a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n t so impersonal and corporatelike . great breakfast . this place is famous for their breakfast . they have been featured on the food network and they deserve it . the food is great and they make a mean bloody mary . i love breakfast here . their crab eggs benedict is addicting . all their menu items are a hit and they serve mimosas . does n t get any better than that . best chinese food i have tasted in a long time . we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night . there was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area . you can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing . the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning . not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up . the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese . we ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food . first off the food came fast and all together rrb i like that ... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other . so about the prawns they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty . yummy . best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted . next one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli . the brocollis were so fresh and tasty . i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time every piece was as eventful as the first one ... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked . not chewy at all . for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee ... oh la la yummy melt in your mouth . we are for sure coming back to this restaurant . every month if possible . it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel ... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss esp if your in downtown san jose . chintzy portions . the sushi here is perfectly good but for $ a piece either the slices of fish should be larger or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant lrb even for nyc rrb . we easily spent more than $ per person lrb not including alcohol rrb and were still hungry . i m astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ . terrible service food ok pricey . this past weekend had great weather for san francisco standards . so for the ` after beach excursion we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to park chalet . the restaurant was busy however there were a few tables open . we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it d be a minute wait . so here we are my wife year old daughter and i trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building lrb where the murals and artifacts are rrb . minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off . we went back to the restaurant and low and behold we were seated at one of the tables that was available minutes ago logic behind that none that i can think of . we put in our order and although we ordered appetizers the food did n t arrive until minutes later ... with our main course . um so now what are appetizers for oh i forgot to mention that they do n t have bread service . its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag . my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water lrb she had a sore throat rrb and i guess that since it was only water it was n t a priority for them to actually bring it . in other words if they are n t making $ $ off of you then you do n t rate high on their ` service scale . food wise its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n t a fancy place . the upside of the restaurant if i needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or golden gate park . its great if you spent the day there and did n t want to drive to eat . parking is reasonably good they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby . another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides . i d hate for tourists to go to park chalet and think that this is how all san francisco restaurants are like . always good . a sushifiend friend recently visited and our group of three just had to come for dinner . on a sat before a broadway play and we were quickly seated and served . amazing spanish mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi lrb that eel with avodcao um um um rrb . as usual the omikase did n t disappoint in freshness although it scored low on creativity and selection . their specialty rolls are impressive though i ca n t remember what we had . great selection of sakes . green tea creme brulee gets better each time i have it . it is n t the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time . very poor customer service . schooner or later s charming location along the marina in long beach and average food does not unfortunately compensate for its very poor customer service . while this diner had reasonably good food the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service . as part of a small party of four our food was dropped off without comment ; . any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table . when we finally were able to flag someone down it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food who was also not the same person who had taken our order . after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant . a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment to say we had been `` blown off would be an understatement . the manager continually interrupted with `` is there anything else i can do for you a strange comment because she had hardly listened let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience . she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage but we could hardly take her promise seriously seeing as she had n t bothered to get the waitresses name . in short schooner or later could n t have cared less about our being at their establishment . next time we will go somewhere else or try other restaurants close by like mimi s cafe and claim jumper . o clock in the morning . you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi ... then this might be the place . the fish was fresh though it was cut very thin . great service . good sake selection . dungeness crabs here ray s is the place to go for high quality seafood dinners . and they give good quantity for the price . we were only in seattle for one night and i m so glad we picked rays for dinner i love dungeness crabs and at ray s you can get them served in about different ways we shared the family platter and i especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu . i ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting ... yummy and the service was simply spendid quite a delight . great breakfast . great drinks corn beef hash coffee b fast burritos gluten free menu . the service is fantastic at this fun place . if there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a place is open you know it is great . this is the case at this gem . best neighborhood standby . you ca n t go wrong here . every neighborhood has a few great local bars that are the best secrets . in grammercy/union square/east village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot . the music is great no night better or worse the bar tenders are generous with the pouring and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits . seriously you ca n t go wrong if it is unpretentious local fun you seek . oh and the cheese fries are awesome good food great service average prices lrb for the strip rrb . i decided to eat at stack because of their price fixed preshow dinner . when i walked in i was taken aback by their incredible wood decor . the music playing was very hip something pop music but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat which became annoying midway through dinner . we were quickly seated and requested the special dinner which came with rrb shellfish and shrimp appetizer or caesar salad rrb oz steak lrb with a single potato chip rrb and rrb homemade donut holes . i got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright . it was n t the freshest seafood ever but the taste and presentation was ok . before the steak came the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested i pick something from the menu . i picked the asparagus which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared . it was steamed and tossed with garlic . the oz steak came next and it tasted great at least initially . the steak was done to my exact liking lrb medium rare rrb and was nice and juicy . it s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction though both were indistinguishable in taste . though one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak . my mouth felt very dry afterwards and i had that signature ... msg ... taste lingering in my throat after i left the restaurant . finally the homemade donut holes were served for desert . they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and nottoosweet . the desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner . the dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip almost $ after tax and tip lrb about average rrb . but the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly . overall i would go back and eat at the restaurant again . just remember to dress a little urbanchic so you don t look too far out of place . good sake good food i honestly do n t know much about japanese food at all . in the past sake usuallly just tasted kind of like salty water to me . server made several sake suggestions which were very good . had many dishes but the best was the lobster ways . very good overpriced . we dined at the colorado location today . waited minutes for a table for which was ok for such a big crowd . the waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded . also there was only one bathroom stall probably need more for such big crowds . most importantly we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu . at best the food was good and definately overpriced . for the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower . not sure if i would go back . my favortie pizza joint in seattle . this is my `` must bring out of town guests to restaurant and they always enjoy and rave about it . in fact many want to return a second time during their visit . the pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic . i ve always found the wait staff and if you sit at the bar the cooks very friendly . they are n t the most talkative but everytime i ve been there they have been very busy which probably accounts for the lack of conversation . i also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant . it s just the right size for the menu . excellent . my husband and i love eating at mioposto café . we re ca n t say enough about their delicious gourmet pizza s you wo n t be disappointed by their menu . the pizza s are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings . you never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there . the pizza s are light and scrumptious . try the pizza ensalata it s a salad on top of pizza crust . absolutely delicious . the pizza s are not huge and the crust is thin ... keep that in mind when you re ordering . worth the wait . had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning but it was so worth it . the food is sinful . the staff was really friendly . the atmosphere was great . the specialty here is decadent pancakes but i ve been back now four times and i ve been wowed every time . nothing on the menu is less than amazing . go with some friends wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe and enjoy more than your average breakfast . good eats . whose writing all the great reviews why is it that lrb almost rrb every good review is by `` anonymous i do n t know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place . i have been to this place folks and it is bad . maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that s halfway decent . i have been here spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment . fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $ dollar plate and not one was eatable . donot go delicious . the atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate . the best dish are the honwy walnut prawns just outstanding . the service is really attentive and charming . locations . they have locations . the listed and then one in southglenn mall parking lot which is reviewed here and one in ft collins . we waited for an hour to be seated . the service was excellent the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding . it was worth the wait . plan on waiting minutes . will definitely be back . southglenn is largest location . delicious ... i recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful restaurant on street and wow what a great evening we had . the food is fantastic authentic delicious and very very affordable . the decor was beautiful and unique . there was a really nice vibe about the place ... good music atmosphere and happy looking people . our server was very professional and friendly . to the owners of open sesame ... bravo ... i ca n t wait to come back to dine at your restaurant delectable . it s a tiny place so if you get there before on a weekend lrb thurs sun rrb you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar . once you re inside the real experience begins . everything and i mean everything on the menu is delectable . the waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa . the sushi is as fresh as it comes you d think ocean was in their backyard no joke if you re interested in good tasting lrb without the fish taste or smell rrb large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place ... . big thick pepperoni . the pepperoni s cut real thick yum . the pizza itself is not exactly the best i ve had ever but still pretty good . i probably would n t go back though ` cuz i do n t know if it s worth it . maybe i ll go back once more many years from now when i ve forgotten i went there already . sit in the balcony . not bad . food was good and appetizing . portions was just enough for me but may not be for a big eater . fair menu selection . the appetizer was interesting but the creme brulee was very savory and delicious . indoor ambience was modern . if it s nice outside request for a table in the balcony . it s a great place to people watch . although the service could be improved considering the money you put in . our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times . should checkup on us more frequently do n t you think late night dinning with exeptional food . i did n t want to go there because of the reviews and prices i saw on the internet . that was the last night in vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing so we walked in the check the place . we were seated right away the table was private and nice . the service was exceptional sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters . the food was very good filet mignon was probably the best i ve ever try . the portions are big though so do not order too much . groovy music made the dinner casual . the most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places . i have a but here there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd . the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser . there were bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink . i felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom . this place rocks mercedes restaurant is so tasty the service is undeniably awesome the chips and salsa are so yummy and the prices are fabulous . the atmosphere is aspiring and the decor is festive and amazing . the catering is out of this world and raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world drinks are suberb and i feel like i am in a third world country when i walk in the door . insultingly overpriced . mediocre service/quality . this review is for the southglen location which is not listed in citysearch i wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service so this review as well as the other negative ones for their larimer location will go unaddressed . the presentation of snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu . to start off approximately oz of orange juice will cost you $ . they serve it in a tall skinny hourglass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket . i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their menu was so unique that i continued . the pancakes were certainly inventive but $ for pancakes lrb one of them was more like rrb in the pancake flight lrb sample of different pancakes rrb is well overpriced . the pancakes should be larger lrb at least rrb to justify the expense even with the unique offerings . the flavors were good but i have had far better pancakes at a german pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger . on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking and would have had to send them back again if i had n t rejected the meal all together . i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue . to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was . in the end our check came to $ for small pancakes a breakfast burrito an orange juice and an iced tea lrb i had water rrb . this was times what the same meal would have cost at le peep . snooze provided an inventive pancake offering but le peep would have provided better service and quality . much more than just a great view i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray s boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations . ray s is something of a seattle institution but given its gorgeous sound views i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service . imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the thirdbest thing about ray s to start things off our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order . my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious and we splurged on the shilshole sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns smoked albacore tuna ray s fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill scallops in a tasty soy dressing and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce . for my entr&eacute;e i completely enjoyed the seared alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard artichoke hearts fennel and pecorino toscano . the scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique lrb not to mention tasty rrb . my friend enjoyed the grilled alaskan king salmon with delectable creamed washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans . i had a taste of all three items on her plate and they were superb . our server continued to be attentive throughout the night but i did remain puzzled by one issue who thinks that ray s is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner ... they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table . given that ray s is a seafood restaurant ... well you get the idea ... . all considered i have to say that ray s boathouse is deserving of its title as a seattle institution . while i could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one . oh yeah ... the view was good too . this computer is absolutely amazing plus hours of battery... super fast processor and really nice graphics card.. and plenty of storage with gb though i will upgrade this and the ram.. this computer is really fast and i m shocked as to how easy it is to get used to... i ve only had mine a day but i m already used to it... get this computer for portability and fast processing the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run. i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it. and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it. as a computer science student in college i find that the portability longevity and ease of use of this computer make me shockingly want to do homework more; without a big ol clunky machine in my backpack i feel like i can do programming homework anywhere. i highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college. a great feature is the spotlight search one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document. oh my goodnessi am not a happy camper. my hp is very heavy. not easy to carry. the battery has never worked well. the battery gets so hot it is scary. yet hp won t do anything about the problem. i returned the computer to hp and they kept it for months. when i got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct hp told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem. so you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item. currently if i use the laptop i can t sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs. well they don t care a bunch. but at the same time they the company would not and could not do anything about my problem. i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful. and if you are going to deal with hp be careful. in my house hp is a nasty word. since i purchased my toshiba netbook i have been very pleased with it i have a laptob and a desktop. the netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me. the screen takes some getting use to because it is smaller than the laptop. i have not have any problems. the notebook pc toshiba qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me. he gave me this pc about years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it. its still going. it is in the best condition and has a really high quality. this is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone. you will not regret buying such a great thing like this it can t get any better. waited on getting this computer but it has been a great change. ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac. this laptop meets every expectation and windows is great it s fast it s easy easy easy to set up easy to hook to my wireless network. it s even easy to hook up to other wireless networks. the battery doesn t last long but i m sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem. i don t use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it s perfect for me. most everything is fine with this machine speed capacity build. the only thing i don t understand is that the resolution of the screen isn t high enough for some pages such as yahoo mail. i bought it for really cheap also and it s amazing. recommended to people as their first laptop. plain and simple it laptop runs great and loads fast. easy to carry can be taken anywhere can be hooked up to printers headsets. i m already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown. being a pc user my whole life it s taking a bit of time to adapt to the os of a mac but i m finding my way around. the unibody design is edgy and durable. the led backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more. i m learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages. a key contributor that led me to mac is the art aspect. they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and i m looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular. i m excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same. it s more expensive but well worth it in the long run. great product very easy to use and great graphics. one drawback i wish the keys were backlit. i m glad i bought this laptop it was worth the few extra dollars. it had most of the features and all of the power that i wanted to replace my desktop machine. i wasn t really as concerned about portability it s a very large laptop but it s not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise. i m very happy with this machine i love the size keyboard the functions. i don t really have a complaint. it is easy to use good quality and good price. perfect trifecta i would recommend this product. the salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it. this is my first dell i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it the dvd burner broke after burning dvd d during that time they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later. if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before i spoke to different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a person needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever purchase breaking within year of purchase and speaking to people to report the damaged part will be returned late i do not recommend this company or their products so far a great product. high price tag however. still trying to learn how to use it. it is the worst computer dell ever made. it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one. breaks easily. only good thing is the graphics quality. there are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new macbook no viruses this laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials. i am loyal to apple. i am very happy this just keeps having it s hard drive replaced acer won t replace the laptop. the manufacturer s warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts. this thing is a lemon. this macbook is an outstanding product with great value. its ease of use and the top service from apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar cannot be beat. suffice it to say my macbook pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed. it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern. i have had nothing but problems since the day i took it out of the box my first problem was with the preloaded norton firewall/security program. it would not let me connect to my wifi system where i lived. it took toshiba tech support calls and different techs to correct the problem. then just the other day my left mouse button snapped being only months old i am not a happy camper buyer beware. this one in my opinion might be a lemon it rarely works and when it does it s incredibly slow. i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses times and i have not even had it for more then months *if you are looking for a good laptop this is not it like the price and operation. some features arent friendly volume wheel sound quality etc. but for the cost this is a winner. i absolutely love my mac i can t imagine my life without it anymore i ve haven t had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off. apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached. i can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly. i called toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem. i think i might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion. i bought this laptop was the worst laptop i ve ever bought. i spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare. and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare. they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn t work. and that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed. its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop. so if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it... i saved for this laptop for months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait. the display on this computer is the best i ve seen in a very long time the battery life is very long and very convienent. a little pricey but it is well well worth it. it is amazing. in the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced. after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working months of use which was frustrating. then after or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running. a tip for people looking into this computer do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last. has a hour battery life. it is easy to use and lightweight. was very much worth the price i paid. this netbook went bad on me after days. there is a blank lighted screen when i start and that is all. three weeks after i bought the netbook the screen quit working. i baby my electronics so i know for a fact it was defective and not anything that i did to it. overall i feel this netbook was poor quality had poor performance although it did have great battery life when it did work. took the netbook on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop. the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it do not buy it it is the worst laptop ever the image is great and the soud is excelent. i love ths notebook. i love the glass touchpad. easy learning curve. also the display is exceptional i have loved this since i took it out of the box. the battery is really long. the features are great the only thing it needs is better speakers. small and light weight. speakers too small to be of any real use. keyboard good sized and wasy to use. i like it meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis. needless to say not to happy with the product. this is a great machine the design is awesome quality is unprecedented. apparently wellbuilt and gorgeous to look at the macbook pro is a winning combination of price and performance. it is by far one of the greatest investments i have ever made. am very glad i bought it great netbook low price. very good quality and well made. great pick for portability and affordability. the black model also has a very nice seamless appearance one of the better looking notebooks i ve seen. the only problem is a lack of screen resolutions if you need an affordable entrylevel laptop this will fit the bill. i dislike the weight and size cubersome. i dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers. overall it s ok. laptop is advertised as a but the casing looks like that of a . this laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases. peformance is good for the price. if you re not wanting to be mobile this is a good laptop to sit on a desk. had to have this computer repaired twice in the first months after purchasing it. not good for a person who gets online daily. may be better for the occasional web surfer. i just got this laptop for college and so far i am very happy with it. it is so much easier to use good keyboard long battery life largest hard drive and windows and toshiba is a quality supplier. i love this little one. the keyboard has a wonderful nature feel. great battery life. keyboard is reasonable size. small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel. charger seems large for this class of computer. great laptop for the price works well with action pack games. the only thing that i have is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters would help if it was a little lighter then it is. but other then that i would give this product a in hafe stars. good for every day computing and web browsing. a great computer for light home use and business use. might not make the avid gamer happy but i don t really think that is what this computer is designed for. crisp screen great battery life and plenty of storage. very happy. he loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started. i would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school. my only problem is i can not reg. the product key. it want take it it keep saying error. help help other than that gets a great little wonder. it s fast and has excellent battery life. the screen shows great colors. i was surprised with the performance and quality of this hp laptop. the speed is fine. but with a way bigger screen and is able to connect to an hdmi. love it. i would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop and the battery life is amazing. i bought this lap top and the charge time dosen t last as long as they say it will more like hours this computer is the ideal college companion. it s software and speed enable it to do amazing things. i am not happy at all with the product i purchased. a cheaper price should not equal a cheap product. it was over rated the toshiba laptop was a great purchase. the price was very good and the product is top quality. the delivery was fast and i would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again. it has easy to use features and all the speed and power i could ask for. true quality at a great price i am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great toshiba is a great brand even though i haven t had it for a long time i am very happy with it the screen graphics and clarity and sharpness are great. i ve already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye d the computer when i took it out of my bag. i like the laptop overall. the only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time. sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to work this is a great little computer for the price. simple to use and great graphics. it has everything i would need for a home computer. i m very impressed. it was secure and easy to navigate. it is everything that i would want in a computer. besides the great look it is a great machine. once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts. i enjoy very much my new toshiba purchased specifially for attending online schooling. i have found it very easy to use very imformative wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs. i have found also it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access; without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so. i also love the small convenient size of my laptop making it a perfect tool for my academic studies. i am very pleased with my purchase this laptop serves all my needs. screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment. price and purpose is awesome i have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop. the battery life seems to be very good and have had no issues with it. great product. the laptop was very easy to set up. everything was so easy. they were able to setup with labtops themselves within a few minutes. it works fine with our wireless and they ve had not problems. it s a great product for a great price waited on getting this computer but it has been a great change. ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac. the service i received from toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty. my friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance picture quality and ease of use. it is extremely portable and easily connects to wifi at the library and elsewhere. just what the doctor ordered. i cannot be happier with the service or product. power supply went bad after weeks after much effort and days asus replaced it the wifi is very weak. summary spend your money elsewhere this is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life. love it so far. the toshiba net book operates very well. the only objection i have is that after you buy it the windows system is a starter and charges for the upgrade. i bought this netbook for traveling and it s great light functional and meets my needs. the touchpad is extremely sensitive which is the only drawback. otherwise i love it i wasn t really sure i wanted to spend that kind of money it was a great deal after all. i love it i should have bought one a long time ago. not enough time for me to give it stars i ve had the macbook pro for about three weeks and it really is a great computer. i have only had pcs with windows before so this takes a little getting use to. the real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it s speed. it is fast booting up shutting down and connection with the internet. the one thing i wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel. i think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive but i rather have a hard copy. if what you need is a machine to do some surfing email checking word processing and watching a movie or two this is the machine you want. it s priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box. nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents. the screen/video resolution won t increase to a higher resolution then x that being said it still runs video in full screen decently. the sound is a bit quiet if you re on a plane this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones. bottom line i doubt you d be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine. yes i thought the expese was a little much but i now realize you get what you pay for. i love my apple it is quick and easy to use. i ve had to call apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful english speaking from vancouver techs that walked me through the processes to help me. i can t say enough of how satisfied i am with their product and help aftermarket. money and time well spent highly recommended the macbook pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great product. the macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box all the functions works great. speakers doesn t sound that great. love the speed especially so glad i decided to upgrade i ve owned this labtop for less then two months already the mouse button has broke. still under warrenty so called toshiba no help at all. i m stuck w/ a broken computer. will not buy another toshiba this is my second not happy w/ either. i love its solid build light wt and excellent battery life for now . excellent led monitor and well equipped. i love the apple products. the toshiba mini notebook model nb is a great little computer. it is easy to use its keyboard easily accommodates large hands and its weight is fantasic. upgrading from windows starter thru windows home premium to windows professional was a snap; both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary product key. other installed features such as certain printer software are also most attractive. ever since i bought this laptop so far i ve experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services i received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines. i constantly had to send my laptop in for services every months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed. toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another and i am not kidding you i called different hours of the day and you ll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again since they make it sound like they don t have your history list of your calls right in front of them. it s a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them. and at one point they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop i bought the memory stick they recomended . long story short since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one i didn t ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services they finally gave in. was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba i ll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba. remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product. all i can say is wow. this laptop is insane it s so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with. i bought a protector for my key pad and it works great this is definitely a computer worth the money; the mouse is a little bit different than what you re used to though it has one big flat panel and one full bar instead of two separate ones to click with but you get used to it quite quickly. and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer when they have a certain promotion/offer going of course overall this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from. the apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you obviously this macbook is perfect for me because it does exactly what i need in an easytofunction way. definitely recommended not a bad laptop it s a bit slow but gets the job done. the lcd screen stopped working on mine after months. i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat. upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had months left on the warranty. even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had months left on the warranty. dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture. english must have been his third or fourth language. his language was so bad i swore i was taking the turing test and it was failing. after trying to get some help he disconnected on me. after days being denied times and told off once i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt. then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me. after they found no other way they told me to courier it to them since they don t allow the use of the post office at my expense and sent me a page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn t be covered. i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me. they really do have the worlds very worst repair service. this computer gets very hot before shutting down. it is not ideal for children because of the temp. i contacted hp about this situation and was given excuses without results. they didn t even try to assist me or even offer a replacement. i will never purchase a hp again ever. let s just get this out of the way i love apple but the macbook is the best it is super easy to use. all you have to do is turn it on and it works. it is very durable i am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet. i don t do any high tech stuff on it just write papers check mail and sometimes play games so i can t reccomend it if you are in the computer field. in the past four years i ve had it i have never once gotten a virus. i did have to replace the battery once but that was only a couple months ago and it s been working perfect ever since. i would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use stylish fun awesome computer. also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable easy to use computer. this laptop does everything i need it to very well. the best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features. the screen is bright and the keyboard is nice; i find myself using the more than i thought i would. battery is lasting about hours as i am surfing the web on sundays while checking football scores and watching funny youtube videos. for those that care about noise this thing doesn t really make any; the processor doesn t seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on. i took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it. i wish toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the os at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff. once i removed all the software the laptop loads in seconds. this is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine; my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn t require a dedicated video card. overall i am very satisfied with the purchase. great quick laptop for the money. right size and weight for portability. battery life needs more life. battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery. i love everything about it. the only downfall is the battery only last hrs when not plugged in. i would like at least a hr. battery life. otherwise all other features are a this mac is great lightweight long battery life excellent transition from pc; this has been nothing but a headache since we purchased it. i will never buy refurbished again i don t cae how cheap it is. just don t waste your time and money on this. i tried giving it stars but i had to choose at least one but imo no stars summary dont buy hp. if you buy pray you dont have major prolems. runs hot i thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an apple product. after a little more than a year of owning my macbook pro the monitor has completely died. this purchase opened me to the world of macbooks and i am impressed with the intuition of the design the beauty of the product and the excellent technological advances associated with it. then of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the macbook pro. now they are believers in the product. it is easy to use has great screen quality and every so light weight. this little netboook is helping me get work done i homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat. i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the mac offers. i bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her it s very lightweight and the response for the computing she s doing internet focused activity mail research etc. is excellent; the overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she d recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook. if you re looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphicsintensive game you d be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market. previous laptops were pc s still have them but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system. still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better but am very happy with the upgrade. probably as good as you can get in a netbook does everything i ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses. has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device. so far so good i ve been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory. i don t understand why only windows starter is included. strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed this device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers. enjoy that toshib force and durability unparalleled needs longer lasting battery more than to hrs. needs power and mouse cable to plug in back instead of side in the way of operating a mouse in small area. for the use it was purchased for it is a good laptop. comfterbale to use light easy to transport. i love this product because it is toshiba and its . it has no camera but i can always buy and install one easy. i had a usb connect but i can t use it because it is not compatible. that s the downside for me. but i would recommend this product. satisfy what i paid for it. good monitor and performed well. i am using the external speaker sound is good. best thing is i can use existing bit old programs. i recommend for word processing and internet users. the games included are very good games. i would highly recommend this one to my friends i bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio. it works great for general internet use microsoft office apps home bookkeeping etc. it doesn t have a lot of frills but i didn t need any and being able to buy what i needed and not more than i needed was very important. this computer i used daily nice compact design. excellent speed for processing data. and if you are a game player it works with world of warcraft wonderfully. all in all great item highly recommend it. i would have to say that overall its great aside from the trial software and the short battery life lack of a webcam its great. fast great visual oh yea has no numeric pad on the side. best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches to make less easier for people to hack into my favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so i can connect it to a bigger screen. great wifi too. the screen is a little glary and i hated the clicking buttons but i got used to them. overall for the money this is a good deal. there is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer. the speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones i have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music i suggest you get something better. while the keyboard itself is alright the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons. i am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite i like the extra features i love the windows home premium. the battery life has not decreased since i bought it so i m thrilled with that. i also love the design the looks the feel and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull. i would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend. couldnt not use it. tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk. defective software. returned it to walmart. i would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front. i also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen. i went to toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it. one of them seems to have worked. its a good laptop for its value. use is easy. features like the font are very blocklike and old school. would like more trendy high tech features. the start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking. keys stick periodically and i havent had the laptop for days yet. came fully loaded good. seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ie internet tabs programs etc simultaneously. i m really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer. graphics are clean and sharp internet interfaces are seamless. only issue is that it is a little slow and i m fixing that by adding more ram. sound card is limited though. the laptop is very lightweight can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight. it is small enough to fit in one of my purses windows starter is terrific no you can t change the background but i don t need to i use it just for school work. the battery life is amazing the versitility is outstanding. the ease of set up was terrific. i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and install one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever. i had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity because it is very sensitive. keyboard is great very quiet for all the typing that i do. screen is crystal clear yes it s small but it s a netbook awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college. i couldn t believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge. i loaded windows via bootcamp and it works flawlessly simply amazing computer i really like the mac notebook but its very pricey. love the graphics awesome programs including garageband and really cool default background. but like i said before the only reason i don t currently have a mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey. waiting for the was well worth it great value for the price. bigger hd better graphics card and a bid hd. there is nothing to complain about the system. i have used pc s and converting to this macbook pro was easy. if you have the money i suggest going for the i occassionaly use it for work via vpn and it has not given me any problems. the screen is nice and the images comes very clear the keyboard and the fit just feels right. i consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need. the price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop. i ts nice to have the higherend laptops but this fits my budget and the features i need. i normally dont participate in reviews/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts... another satisfied customer. the apple macbook is the best investment that i have ever made. the newer macbook that i have purchased is one of the best computers. i am a college student and it has been very useful. it has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer. it has a lot of memory and a great battery life. it is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed. its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes. iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites. the internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily. i have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me. the screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use very important for use quick typers. overall this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase the graphics are stunning. it s wonderful for computer gaming. i would definitely suggest this laptop it is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all. it has many great programs such as ilife iphotos and others. ilife is easily compatible with microsoft office so you can send and receive files from a pc. in addition all the design tools on pages and keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations. this comes in very handy for me as an educator. iphotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos. it allows you to automatically upload photos to your facebook account with one click. in addition there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture. if you are looking for something reliable this is the laptop for you. this computer was awful i will never buy another computer from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company. the computer first started malfunctioning months after purchasing it. it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it. the system it comes with does not work properly so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all. when calling dell for help reurn or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it. one year of trying to fix the computer by myself with help of friends and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to fix it. this computer was awful i would never recomend it to another person. those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall yeah i wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire. that s how frustrating it was. it is so simple to use i use it more than my desktop. it is well worth the money it cost very good investment. the new macbook pro inch is nothing short of amazing. the speed is incredible and i am more than satisfied. bought from walmart i believe that this laptop was a repaired item. this laptop was bad from the first day of usebrought it back to store for return of money. now am very aprehensive about toshiba laptops. will not every buy anotherlou this is a great value for the money. this is a great computer. we haven t had any problems with it at all. the body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up. overall though for the money spent it s a great deal. but let me tell you the mac book pro is so professional. its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer. for example when my husband turns the light out while i m on the computer. the screen brightness automatically adjusts. it is very easy to type on and feels great besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted. oh it is such a great piece of equipment. its office compatible but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs. i get a ton of compliments on its size and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you re restricted to the width of your body for computing room. very longlife battery up to hours depending on how you configure power level settings . i upgraded the memory and replaced the base windows starter to win home and it runs just fine. i play a lot of casual games online and the touchpad is very responsive. i wouldn t play a firstperson shooter with this mind but if you wanted to run ms office email chat download a video listen to music from a certain fruitnamed music store and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in i d highly recommend checking this out. the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook screen size is not something i d stare at for the entire hours of battery life five days a week. additional caveat the base installation comes with some toshibaspecific software that may or may not be to a user s liking. everything from the design to the os is simple and to the point. love it love it love it it really is perfect for work and play. i am able to play and media files just fine with it. everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome. the only thing that isn t perfect about this netbook is the speakers they are not loud at all but i expected that. i upgraded it s ram to i am very happy with it. lots of preloaded software. the only problem is that i had to add gb ram the computer was kinda slow. tosiba has a good reputation my llast computer was an acer. this is starting off good. what a great little laptop. maybe not the cutting edge satellite but it is a workhorse. i bought it to use in college and it is perfect. i dual boot with linux and that other securityprone os and it performs flawlessly. i made a perfect decision when i bought the toshiba excellent product for the money. no problems no lock ups no disappointments. not super fancy but not super expensive either. highly recommend for daily use. the computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks. i have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed. toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done. i would tell the technician i knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and i had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me i needed to send the computer in. this computer that i have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions. as well as having the plug in the computer come loose. so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good. it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there. the mac book pro performs flawlessly. never had a single problem and don t have to worry about viruses. while i mostly use it for email internet and gaming i m confident all other applications live up to the high standard i ve come to appreciate from mac laptops. worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment. right out of the box this little netbook did everything i asked of it including streaming the everyday video you re bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously . it even has a great webcam and skype works very well. the fact that you can spend over on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine. the windows starter is in my opinion a great way to think about using your netbook basics basics basics. i wiped nearly everything off of it installed openoffice and firefox and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price. this netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop my wife and i have another laptop or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks. i use this for my tutoring business and since i m always bouncing from student to student it is ideal for portability and battery life yes it gets the hours as advertised . asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them. little short on ram but you get what you pay for. the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer left right and front. the headphone and mic jack are in front of touchpad making the touchpad hard to use when using headphones/mic not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person. cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction. i love windows but i can t give toshiba any credit for that unless y all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time. i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty. the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june and returned on july seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned. they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place. the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by toshiba. the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue. instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some miles by air to louisville ky. and toshiba is totally unconcerned. the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter. we don t mind and you don t matter. i would not recommend the purchase of this modle of toshiba computer or any toshiba product for that matter. when it come time for warranty service to toshiba you don t matter. windows vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service. i ve tried going back to xl but there still problems. the technical service for dell is so world it might as well not even bother. just a bunch of idiots who s english as a language is forced at best. i m all for saving money but dell needs to step it up. good price. basic computer. didn t work when shipped from walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop same make/model . it has worked fine. handles all my basic media needs easily. can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display. it is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not. it s a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs. it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part. the gb of ram is plenty able to run windows and at least or other programs with next to no slowdown. my one complaint with this laptop is that i ve noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in. this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components and i m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator but i still expected better product quality for this price range. other than that i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semidecent gaming capabilities. let me start with the good so awesome. great os fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port. this one has had the same effect. the improvements to the os have been relatively gradual but substantive. the unibody construction is solid sleek and beautiful. it is everything i d hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint but somehow a bit more sturdy. for the not so good i got the stock screen which is very glossy. it s still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook. the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlledlighting environment like me i prefer it dark or if you can crank up the brightness. the statement of hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration it s a lie. i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than hrs out of it. the first full charge of this battery got me only about full hours. enabling the battery timer is useless. the time remaining goes from hours plus to less than hours over the span of about minutes. it s so bad that i m thinking i only got half a battery or something. i know what hrs of battery looks like. my only other complaint is that it gets really hot. if you buy this don t go into it expecting hrs of battery life and you ll be perfectly satisfied. the pro is a great product i wish that the inch models came with the intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge the edges hurt my wrists . other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more. great product by apple with the new great looking design. i actually had the hard drive replaced twice the mother board once the dvd drive twice then they finally agreed to replace it all of this in less than years only to get another hp/compaq piece of crap. it was slow locked up and also had hardware replaced after only months so buyers beware it is made better thicker and all out tough i droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and it is still working with no issues i love the easy to see screen and it works well for work persoal or just play. i tell everyone i see out looking to get this or another toshiba. my friends or children use that when they need to borrow the net = when i out grow this meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one and i will be buying only toshiba i just love this lap top i just wish it were all silver or they had all black. that is my only complaint love this laptop wonderful price for what you get would pay more for it if i had too i recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling. i am totally satisfied with my little toshie from the moment i opened the box to the present it has been a great joy. it is always reliable never bugged and responds well. i love the operating system and the preloaded software. this machine delivers. it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an alienware gaming machine. it is a bit heavy. it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required. had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in. this is an oversized laptop. it wouldn t fit in most bags. i was disappointed when i realized that the keyboard doesn t light up on this model. it also does not have bluetooth. you ll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them. i was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing i took it for granted that these features were standard. overall still a very nice machine. boots up fast and runs great i m pleased. the acer one compuer is a great computer. i didn t want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice. its fast has high definition quality in the videos. the pictures are clear as can be. if i had to buy another computer i would most definetly buy an acer one computer. heck if i had enough money i would but it as a gift for someone. im glad that it has such great features in it. it also came with a built it web cam which is great because i can see an communicate with my family members back home. clear picture on it and everything. the one down side to it is that when i play a certin game on here it tends to freeze up sometimes but thats the only bad thing about this computer. the acer one computer that i bought is ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it but i like the big screen on it. its good for playing my apps on facebook or watching movies. im very happy with this computer it s solid. love the stability of the mac software and operating system. the only downfall is a lot of the software i have won t work with mac and iwork is not worth the price of it. it seems to be incompatible with everything else. but the machine is awesome and ilife is great and i love snow leopard x. i love to use it it is esay and light. this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with. i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria. this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures. i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing. the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm. i can use it for all of my needs. i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me. if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again. i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go. from the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer the os is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly. the track pad to me is what really stands out though you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad awesome thinking apple the os is also very user friendly even for those that switch from a pc with a little practice you can take full advantage of this os apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience from the start when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine. the ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it. the screen is bright and clear the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice. fast fast and fast the web pages just fly by. i had my iworks itunes email ms office network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour. that includes transferring my music and movies. good bye blue screen and critical errors skype is just so dang cool with this machine too. if your time is worth anything to you if you are tired of rebooting reformatting reinstalling trying to find drivers if you want a computer to work for you for a change make the change to this computer. it is light and the battery last a very long time. very fast boot up and shut down. let me tell you this machine is great. purchased for development purposes but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing email etc. i thought learning the mac os would be hard but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a pc. the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing. the only time i have restarted is during system updates. great machine if you want to drop the cash for one. ok this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple. the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum. the processor screams and because of the unique way that apple osx functions most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software. i have recommended this laptop to everyone i know who is buying one. i like it so much i bought another just for my wife. took it back as it was defective. page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something. couldn t keep a page up you were working on was a great deal i will give that. the laptop preformed pretty well. it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once. it has times were it freezes for seconds and then starts again. the mouse on the pad the left button always sticks. the mouse is way way way to sensitve. i tried turning it done but it did nothing. the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too. its not bad just very very annoying. think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop. i am very happy with this laptop. for the price and what i get out of it has exceeded my expectations. i always have used a tower home pc and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance. amazing quality plus stylish. the big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies pictures and etc the flaws are this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x. mac is not made for gaming. but there s this application called boot camp which allows you to add another os x like windows. second it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated was not happy with one of the programs on it. it was not clear that the microsoft student edition that was loaded on the computer was a six month trial. also the extended warranty was a problem. the extended warranty for the and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu. overall the computer is very easy to use the screen is perfect great computer my daughter loves. i finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what i need it. i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased. so i m disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority. i just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and i won t have to worry about a crash. i bought this emachines notebook pc in january of this year and i am highly dissatisfied with it. the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning. it freezes and it always shows that there is an error so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it. i tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem. well i started using google chrome which is a little better but it freezes too sometimes. this notebook restarts every time there is a new update so if you don t save your files and information everything will be lost. another issue i have with it is the battery. maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden. there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle and when i click on it it says consider replacing your battery and it does not hold full charge. it is not even a year old yet so i would definitely not recommend it to anyone. don t waste your money the laptop is gorgeous. it is sleek smooth and lightweight. it is easily portable and i take it everywhere i go and might require internet access. the screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution. the processor is very quick and effective as i load webpages and applications. it is quiet and a real joy to watch work. i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the laptop in the sky overall this laptop is great. it has plenty of memory lots of hard drive and great graphics. it runs very quiet too which is a plus. the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible. they only stay charged a little over an hour. laptops are usually used on the go so why not give you a better battery the processor a amd semprom at ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for hd or heavy computing. the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a svideo port that would enable one to hook it to a tv. it is a cheap throw together. save your money and go for a better device. this laptop is a great price and has a sleek look. runs smooth and quick. i wish it had a webcam though then it would be perfect i love my new computer its fast and another thing i like is that it has three usb ports. i love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new toshiba works great on both thank you for your great product everything about this computer is easy to use. wonderful features. the only thing is that the battery won t last more than an hour. it discharges too quickly. kind of annoying but i still love the laptop. it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space. the only downfall is the volume control. the wheel that turns the volume up and down doesn t work in real time. i have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute. i bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since. i love it so much. it has come into good use for my finances scheduling my parents business expenses and it is definitely amazing for gaming. the best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once it never slows down. it s just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open. it works exactly like it did the day i took it out of the box. great investment the price and features more than met my needs. the feature are good enough for what i need. i love my macbook pro my laptop is almost old and i have never had any problems with it. if you are a pc user looking to convert i would highly recommend it it may take a little getting used to but you don t have to worry about viruses or other headaches. not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs. i am addicted to photo booth it is so much fun to play with. i work with kids and they love making short videos on there. i am able to organize my pics music and files easily. if you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac i love the keyboard. the display is awesome. only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive. but other than that i am blown away by all the features this laptop offers. i think this computer is super lame. i dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing. i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it. it doesnt work worth a damn. the display is beyond horrible. i can not even read what i am writing half of the time. there are so many things wrong with this product it just makes me want to set my self on fire i would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage. not to mention it has shit gigs. i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage. do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop. i bought this last week and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touchmouse stopped responding. got another and same issue. i am taking back today. don t waste your money or time. very dissappointed becase i have had toshibas for years and never a issue. stopped booting up less than a week after my oneyear warranty was up. toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it. apparently there is a manufacturing defect something with the amount of thermal paste. toshiba will not acknowledge this problem. when i called toshiba they would not do anything and even tried to charge me for the phone call even though they didn t offer any technical support. i loved the netbook minus the fact that it was windows os until this started happening. but if you can t make your product last more than a year you will not get my business again. i ve had my macbook pro for three years now and still love it in those three years i ve had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by apple quickly and easily. my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan. in the three years i ve had my macbook pro i have never had a virus on my computer and i do a lot of work on the internet. the ilife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product. i highly recommend this product needs constant repair. first the screen goes completely out. then hp sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up not able to connect. now the screen is going darker darker darker. hp is more interested in selling extended warranties which cost more than the netbook new then they are in helping or fixing. oh yeah don t forget the expensive shipping to and from hp. i v spent as much for shipping as i would to buy a new netbook of course a different brand. so far so good with this laptop. fan vents to the side so no cooling pad needed great feature screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive. memory is upgradable. the only thing i would change about it is the mouse keys. they click. sounds like a typewriter but if you can get past that this is a great laptop for a little money i hate this one. vista is a nightmare. no tutorials on the display. the book is useless. the machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your hdtv. thinking about returning it the macbook is a fantastic laptop. you will love this macbook if you choose to buy it. the macbook rarely requires a hard reboot. it just works flawlessly its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action. i honestly love my mac thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict. this was purchased for my daughter and i was pleasantly surprised. it had the full sized touch pad with buttons instead of just one. it made the computer much easier to use and navigate. keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel. this system came loaded with windows starter. so far so good. when i got this laptop in to help me with school i had a hard time from beginning. i feel that it was poorly put together because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it. quite simply this is the best laptop i have ever owned. for me five stars is not enough. i love the macbook pro. my parents bought it for me as a graduation gift and i m totally almost kind of maybe definitely obsessed with it. it was very easy to just pick up and use it did not take long to get used to the mac os. i love the size because the screen is big enough for what i use it for internet artwork and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable. there are several programs for school or office use pages numbers keynote etc. music garageband photo management photo booth iphoto videoediting or moviemaking imovie etc. the builtin webcam is great for skype and similar videochat services. itunes is a handy musicmanagement program and it is essential for anyone with an ipod. allinall i would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone. i love it they definitely have a superior product its not just slow on the internet its slow in general. no i am generous calling it slow. its more like a snail crawl. he can t stand it. i can t begin to say how disappointed i am. i should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer. the key bindings take a little getting used to but have loved the macbook pro. delivery was early too. it allows me to do everything i need from a computer and more. with awesome graphics and assuring security it s perfect i d recommend this laptop to anyone the toshiba satellite laptop is designed to fail the board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues. toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought toshiba will do nothing about it. i actually contact toshiba before i started having problem and was given run around after i supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired. then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i d have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty. it has far exceeded my expectations for power storage and abilitiy. it is easy to navigate and update programs. i ve never had problems with viruses. my next laptop will also be a mac i would like to tell you about the best laptop i just got from mac. my mac laptop is fabulous in both areas. it gives me the power and speed that i need to run all the programs i use to edit. the final cut pro on this laptop is so fast and easy and i can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer which is also a mac. i would buy one of these for every person in my office if i could. in my line of work i often have to take work home and this makes it so easy. i do transcription work on the side and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well. the apple care has never failed me and i expect it to be the same for this computer as well. i will only buy apple laptops from now on. great laptop for school easy to use for beginners in the household. keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable. battery life could be better but overall for the price and toshiba s reputation for laptops it s great my macbook pro has been a huge disappointment. from the build quality to the performance everything about it has been subpar from what i would have expected from apple. the system constantly overheats the battery life is too short the case is coming apart and my core applications that i use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly. i would not recommend this product to anyone. screen is awesome battery life is good. really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints. good laptop for the money. speakers don t get that loud but good enough. they don t crash. if a website ever freezes which is rare its really easy to force quit. never been hacked. no viruses. i have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free even without the warranty. a mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense. its also fun to use the programs are great like iphoto love the editing capabilities imail which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad imovie etc. she said its very user friendly. however i love this particular mac because its very fast great size and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad. i am very happy i bought this mac well worth the extra money. now that i have it i see that i really needed this for much more. i run dreamweaver final cut pro photoshop safari firefox msn messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time. i have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing. i highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door. that was my first apple product and since then i have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs i have bought. my macbook pro is no exception. since i ve had this computer i ve only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth. i also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad. the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it iphoto imovie iweb itunes garageband is all very helpful as well. i would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality shiny this laptop is the best of the best the awesomest of the awesomest. it is so great i can hardly ever take my hands off it my friends are in awe every time they come over i got it for christmas and i was so excited to set it up it is super fast and always loads. i am just amazed. the only bad part is the size/weight. it s like punds but if you can look past it it s great if you don t like fingerprints this might not be the laptop for you. it super shiny so you can see the fingerprints easily. all for such a great price. it s color is even cool. another great thing is the beast graphics. they are so realistic i am just speechless. i let my friend borrow it and she knows nothing about computers and she used it with ease. the cool thing about this is anyone can use it. i don t know how i could ever live without my qousmio. i own a hewlett packard laptop and i ve had man problems with it since i bought in in feb ive had to call tech support many times. each time taking about day or so. i had to wait weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly. i had to pay for the shipping i will never buy anything from hp again the toshiba satellite has been more than i expected for the price. this computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse. you can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever. for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is. when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke. but after i got used to it i love it. the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming. it has usb ports sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion. the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have. overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive. i use my mac all the time i love the software the way it takes a short time to load things how easy it is to use and most of all how you don t have to worry about viruses. with a mac you don t have to worry about antivirus software or firewall it s so wonderful. all apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed. this computer will last you at least years thats an amazing life spanned an electronic. everything about a mac is wonderful it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system but you will learn fast and its all worth it. not working = bad i spent dollars on a top of the line laptop . i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it. payed for a premium laptop blue screen first month horrible customer supportthey lost my laptop for a monthgot it back months later laptop still did not work blue screen within a week... cut my losses and sold it for parts this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this never happen... what an elegant wonderful machine. i m making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the old way and apple does indeed have the better idea. i really wish i had done this years ago. pairing it with an iphone is a pure pleasure talk about painless syncing used to take me forever now it s a snap. i love it never had a computer i was so impressed with and i ve had a lot of laptops and desktops this one is far and above the best one i ever had before. i tell everyone that i know friends family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used. the computer blinks it shuts off at will. the letter a stopped working after the first week. when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is twenty three days from the date of purchase. so the fact that the computer does not work on the twenty fourth day is my fault. they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem. they have not sent a new one nor called. i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus. then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east. so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand. then to make matters worst there is noone that they can transfer you to. i had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair. got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it. weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications. do not buy gateway computers they are junk and the warranty company is horrible. you will not be able to talk to an american warranty service is out of country. computer has been at service facility more than in my hands. i have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied. the only problems are the sound isnt very loud i have to wear headphones. another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed to send it in to fix it. that whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the and it was fixed. it took a little over weeks until i got it back. and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke. to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk. the graphics are great. the internet speed is spectacular. the battery life is probably an hour at best. oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all i use the old word processer which works good. i would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about. i wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month. i received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst. at first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and i send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later i then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now i have to send it back again to get it fixed again. this computer doesn t do that well with certain games it can t play some and it becomes too hot while playing games. oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn t come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is for two cds. the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop. i bought a hp pavilion laptop and have had so many problems with the computer. the computer is so slow even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up. they said it was a computer error on this type of computer. also i have alot of trouble with it getting very hot and not even sitting on anything to make it hot. when the computer has been on for several minutes it will occasionaly just go off by itself. also the battery does not last very long at all. i would recommend not buying this product. i have had no luck with staples or hp to resolve this problem. i am stuck with a laptop that i cannot do very much with. also i have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly. also i have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines. it gets stuck all of the time you use it and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work. sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer. will probably never buy a hp again. purchased a toshiba lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out. after the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace. i hate it. i have had the luxury sarcasm of owning of these laptops. the first fell apart right after the during that time i had to send it back times. i paid about for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me. none of the techs at hp knew what they were doing. they would repair one thing send it back and it would still have the same problem. the processor went on me the fan went and the motherboard went. i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused because they knew it was trouble. i had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty. i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about for the extended warranty. i sent it back and they lost it. i waited and waited and no laptop. finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box. i waited another month for approval and for them to build me a new laptop. here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing. hp didn t fix it. i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one. in months the connect quality got worse and worse. time they got it working the next month they had me send it in. returned it. months dead again. they say sorry out of warranty. summary they played games with me for the warranty period. now months later they want would not say exact amount to to fix the machine. they had me send in the machine last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything. now the machine won t connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty the repair for days and now i m out of warranty even though this has been a constant month occurance since i bought the netbook. so buyer beware when buying toshiba they are wonderful but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat. i burned my leg after lifting it from my desk and for less than second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table so i can place it there. i had to call apple times each time to minutes on the phone and take it to their store for evaluations and diagnostics times. for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin it happened months ago they offered me an itouch you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich offer a loyal customer like me a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this . steve jobs probably needs help and donations and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby. the lesson learned here is it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible as fast as they can and in this day and age the customer no longer is right all the times. i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop. anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone. so i called customer support which is good too and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all i just chose to hide the message. also the speakers are not very loud but it is a netbook. would highly recommend this netbook though. i custom ordered the machine from hp and could not understand the techie due to his accent. the computer was two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork. my laptop cost approximately and died after only and of use. although my model was listed as recalled hp denied my claim. this laptop leaves alot to be desired i have had it only months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice... i bought it from hsn because it was bundled with extra software but as it turns out that software just crashes it more often..... if you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal. the repairs were made quickly though i must say however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me. unable to boot up this brand new laptop. spent hours on phone with hp technical support. they went through asking me open up various components taking battery out hard disk apart and after hours on phone could not fix it. they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site. i am going to go back and return at store i bought from this computer had exactly the specifications i needed. small enough to use on a long flight light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips. the perfect notebook... when i finally had everything running with all my software installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed. the aspire wont even boot past the acer screen with a droid i have tried both motorola and htc plugged into the usb port. called tech support and got the usual acer we don t support software but for $$$ we can help you i explained there was no software involved in booting. no tey don t even support their own bios and it could be a problem with the bios how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity needless to say a pc that can t support a cell phone is less than useless with today s company fighting over marketshare its a shame that asus can get away with the inept staff answering thephone. i agree with the previous comment that asus tech support is horrible which is a con in my opinion. summary i ve had this laptop for months out of the blue the power adapter stops working. but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website frustrated i hung up and tried to call back days later to be told that it takes days for turnaround time. this was the day and part still had not been shipped. the rep did not even answer my question i had to ask him if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he didn t even try to acknowledge my question. i m tired of the inept service. if you are looking for a netbook pc do not buy from asus unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can t find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small. i m really frustrated by this experience. how does the power supply not work our apple macbook pro notebook computer notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking. i do everything on this computer check email facebook shop check blogs write papers listen to music and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv. it pretty much does everything we could ever need and looks great to boot. apple is always great about the aesthetics of things they always come up with good looking products. it didn t take me long to get switched over to the mac computer programs and navigation it s been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better. so if you re thinking of a laptop i would heartily recommend theapple macbook pro notebook computer notebook for all your needs it s great and we will always stick with apple computers we have been so happy with them. the macbook pro is portable durable and very capable. it has a hour battery life when you re doing web browsing and word editing making it perfect for the classroom or office and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ll have a battery life of just over hours. it s also very energy efficient running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a watt lightbulb. it s graphics aren t bad at all for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics. the operating system and user interface is very intuitive and the large multitouch track pad is amazing. however the multitouch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you re gaming . still this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work. they also have a longer service life than other computers i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks . probbly the worst decision we ever made it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were. i love the size of the computer since i play games on it. i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have. also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard. so i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer first it does not have a push button to open the lid. it is held in place magnetically. there is a little indent to help open it but good luck with that. once open the leading edge is razor sharp. this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design. using this machine is like a mild form of torture. the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare. i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening. also the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it. i hate to say this but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back then i would. it is absolutely horrible to use despite all its so called advanced features. i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use. it s a bummer and one out of five is being kind. my mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary. in due course i ll remove the hard disc from this new macbook pro and dump it where it belongs in the trash. but the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing. i like this machine because its very lightweight... very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent... hours of battery life is really something else.... i highly recommend that you buy this product. it crashes and when it goes flat it just dies like a pc maybe worse and i loose all my open documents i hate it it is the easiest computer i have ever used i love it i can t say enough good for it it s a mac i fine apple macboook pro notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go. i like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races. it s face and depanable. as a graphic arts a retired instructor i still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art ..... it s just a great toy to have around. very very slow laptop. tons of bloatware and junk programs. can t reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers. keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed. lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small. amazing machine. it is a big big but since it has a screen what would you expect it is truly a desktop replacement. very fast and efficient does a great job with video shot on a canon mkii. very happy with my toshiba laptop the touchpad is very intuitive so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again of course i also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork garageband and imovie. i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets and rather quickly too. i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows on it by using the vmware program. now i have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the mac i also got the added bonus of a hd monitor which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh i never have had a good result with this computer. i was told by many that it was a great computer but we got one of these and it worked great for one year and as soon as the warrenty was up then it got really bad. they told me it was my loss even though it was the computer not what i ve done. the hard drive crashed as well and i had to buy a new power cord. they told me to reprogram the computer and i didn t need to do that and i lost pictures of my oldests first years of her life. i don t like this company nor the toshiba brand and i ll never buy another one because i ve put more into it then it is worth. i would rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a toshiba that isn t good at all. the right speaker did not work. again the same problem the right speaker did not work. i returned the laptop for a full refund. the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i ve ever seen. sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move. the mouse buttons are hard to push. i cant believe hp put this out. do not buy you will be disappointed. i m returning mine dell is a decently made pc. the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side. with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch. so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop. i love hp it s the only computer/printer we will buy. this is perfect for her field. at first when i got this product i loved it. the computer itself was fast ran smoothly and had no problems. then within months the charger crapped out on me. so i called compaq and after being on the phone for hours i finally got a replacement which i shouldn t have had a problem getting since it was under warranty. months later the battery went. they gave me a hard time yet again but their was a malfunction in the battery itself it didn t die. then one month after the warranty expired the replacement charger went. i had to pay for a universal charger for this cheap laptop. not worth it one bit. the people are frustrating to work with the product itself is very cheaply made and the accessories are less than satisfactory. also my sister got the exact same laptop since they were so cheap and after months the screen split in half just from everyday use. apparently under the screen there are little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth they come loose. and it is impossible to get them back in. strengths wellshaped weaknesses a bad videocard after min the screen of the notebook switched off. it was still working but there was nothing on the screen. i was said it s videocard. very disappointed didn t expect to repair it at once don t buy this model. an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will. mine came at w/o a dvd burner . the screen is framed by half to a fullinch margin that is obviously unnecessary reduces the screen size and increases the bulk. the usb ports are nice but the two on the side only work now and then. keyboard could use some trimming. did i mention everything about it from size to weight to keyboard screams bulk i m glad i made the choice to switch and buy this mac. the benefits were immediate awesome graphics the magnetic plugin power charging power cord is great i even put it to the test by accident excellent innovation this laptop rocks only wish it could run solidworks cad which apple doesn t support i ve saved a lot of time and headaches so far using my new macbook pro. i have never had any issues or problems with my macbook pro so far and it is still as fast as it was when i first bought it. i especially like the backlit keyboard. it makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier. it is also very lightweight making transporting this computer very easy. the graphics on this computer are also stellar very clear and vivid. i use iphoto all the time which is a great program for anyone who is into photography amateurs and experts alike. the program came with the computer and works beautifully. i definitely will buy a mac again if and when this computer ever fails. my hp died after only months. it started out getting hot after only a few months. at months it started shutting off after only or minutes. i use a cooling pad but it doesn t help. i took it to the shop and they said it would cost too much to repair it. i will have to say that i love my macbook pro it fires up in the morning in less than seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing. this is now my macbook pro and i really honestly love it the macbook pro is very sturdy and versatile. i love it i even got my teenage son one because of the features that it offers like ichat photobooth garage band and more we are addicted to the mac. this is a great laptop and i would recommend it to anyone. the os takes some getting used to especially after being a windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it great laptop that offers many great features lightweight and the screen is beautiful it is easy to operate and i have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new rolls royce of laptops. buy it love it and i promise you won t regret it. this computer is good for days then it sucks for the rest of your life. you will regret it if you buy any dell. dell sucks the only pro to this computer is it was under everything is falling apart internally and externally. with in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down. i am constantly trying to uninstall programs clean cookies and delete unused files. nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan. more times that not the screen pops up saying i have a bad internet connection or the page can t be displayed. it takes me approximately tries to get to each site then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works. i have vista so i am unable to install and uninstall some programs. i can t even install one of the printers i have in my house so i am unable to print. externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit and the screen has a terrible glare. in short i would never buy a compaq again. i bought this laptop on saturday and am completely in love with it it was super easy to set up and is really easy to get used to. the online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a pc. the performance is awesome. i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my macbook pro was worth every dollar. with all the goodies inside this machine it is a value. it is very well built. the keyboard is top notch. the touch pad is among the best. the screen is huge and coloful but no led backlighting. the video card is great for media and above average for gaming but not a gamers first choice. the problem i had with this unit was unresolvable. it had a cooling system malfunction after minutes of general use and would not move past this error. i acually believe the issue is with the nvidia grafics card but still requires a return. sorry toshiba but impressions do count for something. i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it. so this was great for me. it has just enough ram to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs. plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work. i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems. but i am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it. i look forward to years of use it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well. the difference is the toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space. it s super fast and a great value for the price i would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one. a month later we reinstall the os vista . a coupla months later they change my hard drive. a month or so ago the freaking motherboard just died. went silently. one night i turned the freaking thing off after using it the next day i turn it on no gui screen all dark power light steady hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does. the motherboard is dead and i m still paying the bloody financing for a product which didn t last me at least three years i initially purchased my macbook pro in april and i loved it. i was so happy with my new mac. then the hard drive failed; my information was all lost my fault i know but i never thought i would need to back up my information on a brand new mac the paragon of all computers so after apple replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another months of my new computer until it froze this morningcompletely. i can t even turn it off. it s catatonic. even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it s like new i might have months next time. i would rate this computer at stars but considering it has a short life span i can only give it and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine. great battery speed display. it works my house is now macbook. the macbook starts fast doesn t crash has a fantastic display is small and light i have the model and isn t always complaining about updates lost connections errors blue screens etc. this is what a laptop is supposed to be. i thought the price was great for the specs. but after using it a couple of weeks the overall operation is poor. i hate the display screen and i have done everything i could do the change it. the keyboard is too slick. i really don t like it but i am stuck. dell latitude is not a reliable machine. the battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes. later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months. the machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely. very disappointing i was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain flash. web access through the network is so slow it s very frustrating and very disappointing. after purchasing this thing i find out that i need a special interface device to connect my camera and that it cannot be purchased at the store only on line. hp pavilion notebook pc when i first got this computer it really rocked. but as time went on i found it almost impossible to keep the thing online through wifi. eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on. guess i ll stay away from hp. my macbook is probably the best investment i have ever made. i have had it for almost four years now and i have only had a few problems with it. the most recent being that my safari internet browser is freaking out on me but i have just been using firefox instead. i love this computer. its small enough where i can take it pretty much anywhere but still has a big enough screen to get everything done. the only thing that i don t like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that i want to be able to run and i am not able to. games being the main issue. it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i can t play it because its not compatable with the software. other than that i don t have one complaint in the world this computer periodically crashes office iphoto safari . it takes a long time to get on the web and to change web sites. locks up she searching for updates. it seems that this computer might be a lemon. i purchased my macbook pro retina from my school since i had a student discount but i would gladly purchase it from amazon for full price again if i had too. the retina is great its amazingly fast when it boots up because of the ssd storage and the clarity of the screen is amazing as well. but if you buy this i would highly recommend that you buy a case and screen protector for this machine as they are known to be quite fragile. count me as extremely satisfied it s a perfect computer. i just bought this computer from the apple store and i couldn t be more impressed with it. it has a stunning retina display and is very fast. this computer is good for anything and it has really superseded my high expectations. also the sound quality from the speakers is crystal clear and everything is just sleek and smooth. the hd display is sensational and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me. no hardware issues as is common with any apple product. great product and couldn t be happier with it. awesome laptop i love it i love my new thinkpad it gives me everything i need from a computer and with the long lasting battery it also gives me mobility. i can use it anywhere. it was a great purchase. all the sturdy and substantial feel you expect from a thinkpad. average performance on almost every benchmark but priced accordingly. below average on the wfi adapter which i m still trying to get to the bottom of. great laptop. fast. works very well. would purchase again. a good value for the money. quite pleased with it. fast enough for my purposes. no bloatware from third party parasites to uninstall. excellent keyboard and crisp screen. battery could be better but it has robust processor and plenty of ram so that is a trade off i suppose. i m glad to have it and it showed up in only a few days. the laptop itself is very good it could be better but not bad at all for it s price point. it does everything i need. the big deal with this was windows when i saw this i grabbed it. it has met all my needs. just what i expected. i don t have any complains about this computer outstanding laptop and very well built. the retina display is fantastic. one of the best thing i have bought in years. great pc light and powerful. is just amazing.= the glare of the glossyretina display is unbearable. do not buy a mac until this issue is resolved. performs as advertised if not better super light weight i never cared either way about weight until now . feels like solid state. wonderful machine; glad i bought it. tiny forgivable drawback no ethernet cable outlet. but that s not a dealbreaker. super laptop will probably get another one for my wife a bit ugly but works good i like the design rather sleek and light. i will give advise any prospective buyers this is not great laptop its good for web browsing and word processing fantastic for the price just wish it the keys were illuminated. if your on a budget.... save up longer. this laptop isn t worth a single cent. i couldn t even install linux on it. windows runs very poorly. just save your money and get something better. awesome price for a laptop that lasts more than hours without recharging awesome this laptop is a complete cheap junk. by just looking at it you will realize it s crap. it s not what you pay for. the case is made from cheap plastic. in the description it said there is bluetooth but no there isn t. i m warning you you re wasting your money on this love the computer. hate windows it dosn t even have a disc compartment had to return the computer. keeps freezing no ethernet outlet disc drive will not open or function odd unusual dell commands would have exchanged instantly but had to use as if for college immediately. unimpressed. terrific laptop. works beautifully. great price. just what we needed for our daughter to do her on line math class this is a great home computer. it is very very quiet. the only reason i didn t give it a star is i feel i have to reach so far to type on the key board. you also have to press firmly on the keys. otherwise this is a great computer great prices. was easy to set up and has been easy to learn to use it. works good and is fast enough for me. good product for a good price. it was too cheaply constructed. it also gave me an introduction to windows which i hope will be discontinued it the future. the computer is horrible its to slow. the thing that you insert cds into won t open. not a good computer at all. we returned two days later. they were excellent to handle our return and post our refund back into our account the next day. great price and computer they loved it. it s easy to operate and it s very light my parents are almost yo they can t carry a heavy computer while traveling . but here s something i hadn t realized before buying it there isn t an optical drive which means no cds or dvds this product was doa. fired up and worked for the first day and then the display died on my wife while she was taking a timed test. would not recommend. pretty good laptop. good for basic stuff. don t try to use to play any pc games or anything. just for simple web browsing and media streaming. pretty premium feel for the low price. i have so much trouble turning the computer on. it comes on for seconds then shuts itself off. my mistake was to not research this one no dvd and no place to insert my ad card to download pictures. i should have waited to find a higher quality computer. i m very happy this laptop is beatifull is nt slow at all. but it doesn t have a cd unit anyway the other thing is that the laptop does not have an ethernet port for cable connecting. just wifi.... the screen is big and everything was as described for everyday use you can t really go wrong with this laptop. if like me you will be paying bills occasionally reading the news or just buying stuff on line then this is a winner. if you are a gamer or need it for heavy computer use get something else. it s a good starter computer that is extremely light on the wallet. like i said good for basic stuff and as a starter. still getting use to window has a built in camera which i do not use. sturdy but only for typical wear and tear. can not believe the price amazing computer perfect for school. i ve had my lenovo for a little over a month now and it does everything i want it to do and more. i really have nothing negative to say about it. the keyboard is a little wonky with having to use the function button to get the fkeys but with how infrequently i use those it is a nonissue. it is a great value for what you get. i can run somewhat modern games like skyrim and fallout new vegas with no issues. i get giddy every time i use this thing. it is a thing of beauty and fast enough. when you click and don t wait. so yes it is ridiculously fast. the battery will get you from la to ny no problem. the different than my other computer so we have to get use to it. it is very light and the picture is nice and the price was amazing. can even readmy kindle on this computer excellent item shipped on time met my expectations it doesnt heat at all dont use it for gaming for the price this is a super product out of the box. it wont wow you with its speed but who can complain at plus this computer comes with a full size keyboard. no junkware this computer is great for someone who is looking to manage their online life banling facebook etc and some basic offline work using ms office. the only drawback is no dvd player.. but for you can buy an external one very light and beautiful. it s just a little slow. five starts terribly slow... start up time took forever everything runs very slowly. screen broke month outside warranty. overall build quality is cheap. avoid acer. not bad. nice and light seems to help your work instead of becoming work itself. perfect size for me. probably not a gaming machine which i have zero interest in. i just love this ultrabook i defenitly recommend it for anyone for office and home work it s ok. i find that it often gets very slow and i have to restart more than usual. it s light and easy to use though. i love this computer this is my first ever mac i m and it took a little while to switch over from the os i was used to but it was a fast learning curve. the resolution is gorgeous the computer is light it does everything i need and the interface is pretty intuitive. i love this computer however i am very upset that it doesn t have the superdrive built in supper east to use. retina display is beautiful. also very quick laptop con hate that it has no disk drive. i am also glad it doesnt get too hot when left on for an extended period of time. the battery life is good even with using high profile software like sibelius for a good half of the day. wonderful super fast lightweight computer the new macbook pro working good user experience fast speed faster start up time. this is what i was looking for. it has a wide screen and it s easy to use. at my age i need this kind of laptop. extremely slow. a masterpiece of crap. not durable . slow processor just not it i can t use the trackpad very well it s too sensitive so i hooked up a mouse. external monitor worked easily. been using lenovo thinkpad edge laptops in our business for several years now and have no complaints about any of them. they have held up well not just in our sales department but also in our service department where they are exposed to dust exhaust grease oil and all manner of other noncomputerfriendly substances. general a quality laptop. the lenovo software that comes preinstalled may qualify as bloatware but is easily removed if you re not interested in it. windows rocks. computer runs very slow great laptop bigger screen than expected laptop with a desktop design that is really nice to use for all types of usage including programming/editing one of the very few laptops still available with win pro multiple usb ports and a dvd read/write drive. only drawback is no led to show when the hard drive is being accessed. not a necessity but something i ve come to expect. does what i need it to do and the price was right great laptop from apple apple is unrivaled in terms of build quality and functionality. the retina screen is absolutely beautiful and the touchpad is the best touchpad to date. the pair allow for seamless navigation throughout the whole interface. battery life is astonishing given the processing power and high resolution display. i can easily get hours out of a full charge. overall a high quality laptop and a great value considering all this computer has to offer. well worth the extra cost. size is perfect and display is beautiful excellent performance especially given its price point. the screen is wide and provides excellent clarity. it is not a small compact laptop but i won t be traveling via air often so its size and weight is not a problem for me. i can appreciate why she recommended it don t expect much in terms of performance from this laptop. it gets the job done in terms of having a computer that can browse the web use word/excel and the like. this laptop does not have an ethernet adapter for wired network connection. fast easy so far i do not have any trouble with it other than the picture quality is a bit poor. i have had it over a month now and it works just fine. this laptop suits my needs as i am currently studying online and just need a computer for that purpose. my daughter uses it for college too and it works great for both of us. so i gave this stars but only because of the poor picture quality other than that it is a great buy this laptop is absolutely horrible. i bought it simply for excel on windows for work since i have a macbook air and literally the thing freezes and lags opening excel or my web browser. there is a chance mine is defective but regardless i m not going to try another one this is a terrible product. i d much rather bite the bullet and spend a little more for a product that actually meets minimum computing expectations for i appreciate the effort to hit affordable pricing dell but just not worth it. it is slow and complicated and very disappointing great labtop.. not as fast as i would have liked it to be but everything else is great i ve only had this computer for a few days an i already don t like it. the battery life is a joke and it s causing other problems. i will be returning it. if people are writing bad reviews about this laptop then believe what they say. this is an ok computer. the processor shows a speed of the sound is disappointing. no bass sound at all. maybe this one is just a dud. the computer is very wonderful. was not aware it did not have a disk drive when i bought it or i would not of purchased it. it does have a habit of restarting itself when you try to do the log in pw. but over all. im very satisfied. its very fast and very light. great product. i am giviing it four stars instead of five because of no disk drive and the crashing i absolutely love my dell inspiron it powers on/off very quickly and it loads up automatically. the mouse click is a bit loud but it really isn t a problem. for i highly recommend very poor quality lap top.... i am returning it... slow great value laptop i can t believe this was just speed is great easy to set up and get going. very pleased so far. it is very difficult to use this computer. too many steps to get anywhere and hard to set up this things run smoothly for its price and the battery life seems to go on forever. i wasn t disappointed in its performance. all in all it s well worth its price tag. great laptop for the price. it was nearly impossible to find a laptop that had a a side keyboard. b a dvd/cd player. c a large hard drive instead of using the cloud d was under with shipping. the only con is windows effin still giving it a star rating because it is fast and a nice sized screen. great for web design and general work. overall good but processing power isn t very good. pro with pro upgrade is nice but it frequently freezes for a few seconds here and there. i replaced stock drive with wd black drive and is still quite slow. battery doesn t last long web browsing hours maybe . it has some bloat wear that i wish weren t there. it works fine for a pc in this price range. i bought it for my parents late and they love it particularly the keyboard and screen. terrific value for the money. love the key layout and the builtin mouse pad all work well and are properly sized. highly recommended. works good but doesn t seem like it s made sturdy. kinda to light and plastic feeling. killer computer. i would highly recommend this computer it is fast doesn t have touch screen but i have a tablet so that wasn t so important. look and feel is good. i am experiencing the system little slower than what i have expected. and processor feels pressured even though i run medium scale programs watching the way exhaust speed increases. the hdd has a scratching noise. the system sometimes lags a lot. i don t like it at all... i can t put a protector to make presentation... a good value on a quality product. easy setup and delivers all the functions we need. this laptop is amazing despite the fact that there s no optical drive everything is perfect. the screen resolution is crystal clear the speakers are amazing and the track pad is easy to use. the home page/startup is easy to navigate which is the one thing i was mainly concerned about. internet is fast and reliable battery life lasts a long time. i love this laptop looks like this dell is a piece of crap. it does not turn on if i take the battery out it might work not sure if it s a bad battery or computer do not recommend awesome laptop bootup time is amazing battery life is decent and it has a great slim form factor. there is somewhat of a learning curve but the operating system and hardware of this mac are great. more than enough for my use. the display is vibrant and clear the keyboard is well designed and pleasant to type on; i even installed a windows partition to be able to run windows software. things just work they are fluid easy to use and understand fast and work well. this computer is absolutely perfect for web browsing watching video word processing and that s about it. if you want a computer that plays games or any advanced tasks like editing video this computer is not for you. now when i say don t expect to play games on it i mean it. pretty much every major game save for solitare won t even play on it due to the slower processor. its also worth noting that there no bluetooth no mircophone jack no ethernet no dvd/cd drive/burner and no usb ports. it does come with two usb ports a hdmi port and a webcam. the webcam is nothing special its there if you need it. don t expect it to take good pictures or video. the battery is pretty soild. it lasts up to hours with normal use. the computer itself runs very quiet and is mostly cool to the touch. the only major negative to me is windows though ymmv and the dell crapware installed. not bad for the price. i needed an inexpensive laptop to do basic office work on that was lightweight and this fits the bill just fine. performance wise it s a bit slow but that s to be expected from a celeronclass processor. i m also not a fan of windows but fortunately i can install whatever i want on the laptop without issue. love everything about this laptop sound quality and touchscreen are awesome i would definitely recommend this i love this laptop to the moon. my favorite colors black and red the matte material and the red backlight of the keyboard. the sound is great and it s fast. the laptop is beautiful not extremely light but thin enough and wide screen with a full keyboard. the touch screen response is fast and it picks up bluetooth and wifi fast. microsoft office is a day trial a number of games and apps are already preloaded. it s exactly like the picture and i am satisfied. great laptop light and very versatile it was easy to set up. i like the number pad for work so that s nice this is going to be random and unorganized but here are my thoughts on the laptop so far so good after a month. it took some getting used to on the widows after being an xp user for many years. everything seems to be running smoothly. only downfall is the preloaded mcafee and other software. they are fine while the free subscription is going but a pain when they start asking you to spend money every time you login. device is light weight quiet during operation and produces little to no heat. it has a quick start up and shut down time. the display is good quality. just wish there were more usb ports. i am impressed with this computer inexpensive but quality. love the size i am using this for work i am a nurse and have to chart daily this is easy to use and i have not had any problems with it. it s so damn good i bought d if you re the type of person that just likes to browse the internet and enjoy media and do light work with microsoft office this is the laptop for you. don t expect it to be a champion performer so if you want to play games or whatever this is not the computer for you. it s extremely light weight and slim because of the lack of an optical drive who uses those anymore anyways so it easily fits into any college students bag. i would recommend this to anyone who doesn t need much out of a computer. i am very happy with this computer. it is exactly what i expected and the price is excellent you are getting what you pay for and in my opinion it is worth more. been using it for about hours now and it seems plenty fast and does everything i need it to do. its a very basic laptop. i thought it would have a cdrom drive but there isnt one. also wish it had a port to plug an internet cord into it because sometimes my wifi router likes to not work. but for the price its good. other than the slow cpu it works great for everyday use. heavy gaming is definitely not it s strong point. the cover is a soft rubber texture without the friction. slick design and looks great. the machine is easy to use has the power it needs for personal use and some light professional work. it could be lighter but couldn t everything. the battery seems adequate for most uses ~ hour use/charge. screen is clear and bright. glad it has the dvd drive. perfectly adequate. great pc. the is incredibly fast the ram makes it proper for several games not on maximum quality . great sound quality too. nice laptop. i use it for school its quick and has everything i need on it. good battery life as well. wifi card not working right out of the box. dealing with hp support is a ridiculous and painful experience. i have spent more than hours on the phone with them over different calls only to get no where. now i m looking into the return process which i m sure will just be loads of fun if my prior experience is any indication. seriously save yourself the hassle and purchase from a different company. used to love hp products but this has soured me on the whole company. by far the best laptop i ve ever had. its fast powerful screen display is top notch and the battery life is excellent for a laptop of this size. my only concern is that since the battery is not external i will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time. i wonder if thats just apples way of saying its time to get the newest and greatest laptop years from now lol. the product is average and works well. works at a decent speed. the mouse pad however is very loud which is why i gave it four stars. i had a great experience purchasing my dell inspiron laptop. my laptop was easy to setup and i ve had no problems to date. did not disappoint me at all. lenovo is the best laptop. built in mike is really poor and unusable for skype or any other purpose. and the only microphone input is for a combo mike/speaker plug. so to communicate i need to wear ear plugs or a headset with a builtin mike. that s a nuisance for family skype calls...only one can speak at a time. we haven t used it enough or had it long enough to give it stars but so far it has been a very good laptop. several other reviewers made comments on the keyboard and now i can understand why this keyboard is the nicest to use of any laptop we ve ever owned. i m a lifelong desktop computer user and the keyboard on this laptop is as close to a normal keyboard as i ve ever seen. we like this new laptop a lot very good performer for the price. not blazing fast but quick enough. one really nice thing about lenovo laptops is that they are not cluttered with a bunch or trial software. the desktop was clean once i got it up and running. battery life is above average and it charges quickly. keyboard is sturdy. the touch pad takes a little getting used to as the click buttons are on top instead of the bottom. i will be considering lenovo for all future laptop purchases. this lap top is good so far. it is quiet runs smoothly. i really like the video option on it i stream movies on amazon prime and netflix and there is no lag. the only negative would be that it gets pretty warm sitting on my lap for very long but that is pretty much standard for all lop tops i think. it stopped working days after purchase. it was slow and might be problematic. i would shop around for a better one. crashed only days from getting it says it is failing hard drive. i should have bought something better. the pc is works well with a good battery and a power cable and has a web cam. however it does not have a dvd drive neither does it afford one the opportunity to connect an external dvd drive as the manufacturer did not make any point ofconnection of an external drive. other than a hate of windows she just loves it. the plastic materials are rather cheap. love it needs more instructions with it i m very happy with my acer it does just for what i need it. even the sound is fantastic i love this laptop. even my extremely tech savvy boyfriend was impressed with the features and sleek design. although i ve had it for less than a week i am very satisfied. functions well. does all that was advertised. if it had a star option that is what i would give. the build is perfect the screen fantastic but i do have a bit of a problem with the fact that i have to buy adaptors for nearly everything from vga cables to ethernet cables so almost perfect... display. love the color accuracy. decent speakers. fast. fan when watching video off youtube. sounds like a washer. machine gets fairly hot near the bottom of the screen. battery power laptop had difficulties computing. feels too heavy to me. could lose another pound or two. paid close to out the door. biggest piece of junk i have ever purchased. this clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered. it would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for minutes. the second one after a little over a month refused to turn on even with a full charge. what a lemon this is a big disappointment. i only use a laptop for personal use but this one can t even handle that it takes a long time to load any page. i ve had it for a minth and so far it s shut down completely times. i have had dell desktops for years so had no qualms about buying a dell laptop. never again. i ve always sworn by dell. so with this new order all the upgrades and windows really caught my eye and i got this for the long haul. i am not ultra tech savvy but i can tell when it works slow i barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load. i m so disappointed. in two months both the power cord pin broke the company replaced it and then the cd drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into a million pieces. in addition no matter what i do to change the settings add/delete flash etc. firefox hangs on startup. it seems like lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on. the cords always feel like they are in my way. one positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard which is larger than usual. it s a pleasure to type on. my final thoughts if you are a mac user stay away. if you want to travel with this laptop don t buy it. it s clunky heavy and a pain to start up and shut down. great for games it s truly a great laptop for the price. however this laptop far exceeded my expectations when i bought it for college i only use malwarebytes and microsoft security essentials run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years. for which is as much as my graphics card alone cost this laptop is an incredible value. it is quite impressive at multitasking which really surprised me. i can have tabs open while playing youtube videos and it handles it impressively well. but i should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen it s certainly good enough for the average person but if you re used to good screens this may bother you a bit but it s certainly not unbearable by anyone s standards. if you want to game this thing can handle league of legends on mediumlow settings but i certainly wouldn t recommend it for gaming. overall a great laptop for simply doing basic things and webbrowsing. would definitely recommend for those who are technologically ignorant this computer is very slow i love this laptop it does everything i need it too very good price. very nice computer immediately didn t like the track buttons. they are loud and clunky but i figured i d get used to it. the laptop died two days after i received it. i purchased a dell inspiron and so far i love it this model has a true life monitor which is worth the extra bucks. if you re looking for a basic pc this is the way to go. the hinges on this pc are nice and tight and well made like the rest of the pc. i was surprised at the overall quality and the price in all my life i have never come across a computer as slow as this one it cant perform basic operations and is practically useless. i just received the laptop and if it runs like this already cant imagine how it would work in the next couple of weeks. it took almost minutes to boot up. please people dont make the same mistake i did. this is a complete waste of money dont let the price fool you would be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly. it was not responsive at all to touch. and while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse. if they can fix this i think it would be a very nice costeffective laptop. this laptop broke within the first hour of use. the a key became jammed so that sometimes it wouldn t press in. dell claims they test each key with thousands of mechanical key strokes. also after restarting the laptop it constantly made high pitched electronic noises. i m sure i just got a bad egg but instead of getting a replacement i decided to try a different one. this laptop is nice. it has a decent feel to it sharp display and is fast enough. the biggest problem i have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive. i have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available but nothing has helped. also the touchpad is almost sticky which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad. i would love to keep this laptop but will be sending it back and looking for a different brand. no lenovo for me. initially i liked the product so much. although it was slow but i felt it was ok for the price you have bought it. but now i am having battery problems. laptop automatically shuts down when battery life reaches . i am not satisfied with the product. it s an amazing laptop. most of the things about the laptop is awesome except the touchpad. the laptop is fast. the windows used to boot in just and that was freaking awesome. now i have dual booted my laptop to windows and ubuntu and it s not got too slow either. i am loving it completely. it does make a little noise but that s alright as it s not too much. it doesn t get heated up much even after continuous usage. but the touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever i am typing my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it s really annoying. i prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else. a smaller touchpad would make life easier for computer science students or it people much more easier. uhhhhhh the computer looks good. but it works really slowwwwww it has got me feel like to take years to successfully open a web page. purchased it for my birthday and love it i m so glad that i have. it s been a very easy transition moving my windows created files over to the mac. so far i haven t lost any quality or information. i have a little bit of a learning curve with the keyboard shortcuts. but other than that i really am loving the quality and speed. expensive but worth it. the display has a great resolution but have difficulty always seeing the small print. haven t quite figured out how to make the font size larger overall. this is without a doubt the worst laptop i ve ever had. and of course the return window closed last week so now i m stuck with it. i will never buy another lenovo anything unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop don t buy this. the touchpad hasn t worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning i thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads i ve worked with have some inherent oddities. this one however is now very loose and i have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work then suddenly i can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own. today it hasn t worked at all more than it has. it hangs freezes and just isn t working properly. i have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open though i don t have much installed i only have of the left i have no idea what s taking up all the room it doesn t make sense. i could go on and on but suffice it to say if you want to spend on a laptop don t buy this one it s definitely not worth the money. very fast and good for most steam games. don t expect great graphics though. the keyboard and sound are great and the matte screen works well. can run cs go at fps on low settings. computer was doa. turned it on and it was beeping. i love this laptop. looks good well built and very good speed. needed a usb adapt. for network plug no problem. keyboard is nice and windows is great worried about that coming from xp. price makes this the laptop i was looking for. so far i am very happy with this computer. it has everything i wanted built in wifi connectibility a slot for my sd camera memory card a dvd burner big beautiful screen plenty of usb ports three and one and a keyboard with a nice touch. i liked the fact that it came with windows but also included windows to install later if i need it. the price was good. i use a wireless mouse but the touch pad and the red button in the middle that works like a little joystick also work fine. i wish i had bought this sooner this is a great bargain. yes it s running and old type processor so hey don t even try gaming on it. but if you are just an average user it works really great. the screen is good the whole things is very light and doesn t run hot. i m very happy with it typing on it right now and it is fast enough for that i like everything about this laptop. it has no way of connecting to the internet save wifi but that s all i use anyway i put that free app on for word processing and it works like a charm. i plugged it into my existing printers and it just worked no fuss no muss. it immediately recognized the printer and was ready to go. excellent buy. the worst computer i have ever laid my eyes upon. firstly it has no leds to let you know what is going on no cap lock no hard drive indicator nothing. ok one light to let you know if the damn thing is on. the biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it even when the strength bar is filled. also when you try to download a large file like a video it will start out normally downloading at around and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless. too often i would find it not being able to stay connected to the internet. i was unable to download itunes to it. dell support was awful to deal with. and the settings are simply annoying. just not for me. the computer is as expected and worth the money. the windows is a major disappointment. operating a non touch screen on this system is a royal pain it came with no instruction book no back up cd s and has already crashed. hands down one of my best and most used purchases thus far. the macbook pro does no disappoint... retina screen solid build quality weight fast processor and the reliability of the apple brand. cons honestly zero con s ... as a windows pc user the switch over was seamlessly i run parallel when i need windows. all my devices work flawlessly. i m an amature so this does more than i can handle. i m perfectly satisfied just have to get use to the new system i can t see a problem. i fine now and happy as a bug. the price is great and it does everything i want to do thanks. it s perfect it s great for what he uses it for. i am really not happy with this computer... i don t like windows but that is no fault of the computer but the keyboard is so hard to get the keys to work and the space bar. would not buy it again. meh...but cheap. the first thing i can say for positive is that the laptop is very light makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus. now the graphics are not hd...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic medium low grade plastic. so if you don t have kids or not in high school or don t accidently sit on it it should be fine. now the speed is disappointing. start up is fine maybe secs at most but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times. even for a ram it barely chugs with tabs open. all in all i wish i had waited a bit. this laptop is amazing windows has its pros and cons. the keyboard is backlit but you have to press the key to turn it on. of course this will decrease your battery life. the sound is very nice and crisp. also i have no regrets about going with the ram because its super fast. i m still exploring the various features but overall i am satisfied with my purchase. the hp envy has been everything i expected. after doing much research for a laptop that had all the features i was looking for this one hit all the criteria i had. the laptop is very responsice with the core processor and of ram and the sound out of the beats audio is great. i would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a top performing laptop. used times black screen returned for refund do not use the facial recognition windows is not supported by a lot of things the dell is quick enough sturdy not good with finger prints. it does what it advertises. price is great wish it didn t have windows but that is an opinion. i would recommend it for anybody needing a reliable simple laptop. i bought this for my daughter to use for school and homework it s not a fast computer but it s great for what she needs it for and very light weight love the price too well my first apple computer and i am impressed. works well fast and no reboots. glad i did so far. s.... l .... o..... w.... rea......llllyy slow. like seriously really slow. impossible to use. cant even read properly. plus no russian input wtf what a great laptop i can run my games and work really fast. really light you can carry with you everywhere. great battery life. everything at a very great price. i completely recommend it. excellent value and a must buy for someone looking for a macbook. you can t get any better than this price and it come with an internal disk drive. plus you get which is also a great feature. also the resale value on this will keep. i highly recommend you get one before they are gone. got this on black friday with a very good discount and couldn t be happier. the screen is great i don t see the need for a retina display. i also really like the addition of the sd card slot. this macbook pro is amazing if you are afraid of it not having a disc player please don t be. i love the new high retina display and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter. overall this is a fast light practical computer and i highly recommend it. i bought my macbook pro in october of and years later it still works as flawless as ever i ve never had any problems with the computer itself the macbook charger chords are another story though . i tried not to jump on the apple bandwagon but... you re just living in denial if you don t. happy buying bought this laptop from best buy in january still loving it. i can use it as a tablet as a laptop as whatever i want to i play sims and on it all the time with very little issues. the thing wakes up super fast and is always ready to go. music/videos sound great and look great. i use it everyday. my favorite computer i ve ever had this computer overall is great it runs fast ships fast etc. but the company and seller lied to you and try to make an extra buck i bought this pc to play games and stream movies it could handle all of that but my friend wanted me to put some music on a cd i could see the disk drive on the side but it didn t seem to have a button on it a disk drive with buttons on it and he said&quot; this computer does not have a disk drive and i was furious so beware buyer this computer has a useless piece of plastic on it. thank you asus. they don t deserve to be capitalized great computer. very great apple product as expected. good battery life. great color on screen. good speakers from laptop computer. my new laptop is great. it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp. i have to admit that the operating system is different and does take time to learn but i like it. i would recommend it to anyone. this laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing. the speakers are fairly basic so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies. the touchpad is a little &quot;clunky&quot; for my taste; i use a small external mouse with laptops in any event. i appreciate the relatively large keyboard with number pad and screen size. i also found the track pad irritating until i disabled &quot;pinch zoom.&quot; this is larger laptop but is not too heavy. battery life is great though it is new. overall a solid laptop for its price. however a few things are immediately occurring to me i had read the other reviews here on amazon but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead. well my first impressions are that its ok it certainly boots up quickly thanks ssd and from the limited use so far no games its fast enough in normal usage. it certainly looks nice but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out. also i have found the touch pad to be awkward to use could be i am pressing too hard perhaps and the screen is well underwhelming. to be honest i am a little disappointed and considering returning it. this is a horrible laptop. within a day of usage it already slowed down significantly virus entered the system right away. it s heavy. i regretted immediately. nothing like the description says. my apple mac book pro has crashed three times since i purchased it. each time apple can only uninstall to original factory settings for me to start over. i believe this macbook pro was a lemon right out the gate. this computer is like... i m lost for words. this is the best switch i have ever done. this has much more memory and ram memory. even the battery life is like wow i love love loooove i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied. it contains a long battery life incredible specs and an overall enjoyable performance. upgrading from a toshiba laptop i am fully impressed with all of the benefits that the mac operating system provides. the snappy processor allows for me to quickly upload photos and videos as well as create movies for me and my colleagues to enjoy. in upgrading to this computer i can say i have found little to any flaws in the product hence the star review. love this computer. it has done everything and more that i expected. i am sure it will be able to do all i need it to do in the future as well. the screen looks great in my opinion the sound is nice. so far i have no complaints and dont expect many complaints in the future. this did give some set trouble and i had to call tech support. they were great. its been easy breezy since then. how could you not love a mac so far so good i have not encountered any issues with this computer. love the flip feature and the touch screen feature. for the price that i paid i feel that i got good value. this lap top is not the lightest you can purchase so if that is important to you maybe you should shop some more. to a prospective buyer once you go mac you ll never go back. was the best decision we ever made. it runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems we don t have to defrag deliete cookies run security programs or any of the common pc problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed. you can t get a virus on mac so in the long run the cost of the mac is saved by not buying security and not having to replace your computer every year or two. never had any issues no frustrations just great easy wireless all in one fun it s great. because it is a touch screen you don t even need a mouse. you will probably never use it in tablet mode but it s nice to know you have that option. if you draw on the other hand i m sure you will love using this in tablet mode. lastly because it can flip you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard. this computer is great. i have a gb ssd and gb of ram in it which i installed myself. it runs faster than it did when i got it. i enjoy the simplicity and userfriendly interface of yosemite. i m excited for el capitan. the apps are very easy to use. the resolution is excellent. i am very satisfied with everything about this machine. like so many others who do this there is a learning curve and i m excited to do it. this mbp is clean neat and simple. i like that. it takes less time to power up and if you just close the case it go into sleep mode. when you open it wakes up almost immediately. very nice. i am pleased with my decision however i have only had this for a few weeks. there are a few things i am dissappointed with though. only usb ports. no hdmi port. the headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone. not a big deal for me but if you skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a mac. as a student majoring computer science i really fell in love with this laptop. it s inches which for me is not too big nor too small. it has the latest cpu with a gtx for gpu which makes this laptop blazing fast boots up in under seconds with the help of the ssd of course . it has ssd which is just enough for my os games documents and anything in between. it also has an extra bay for an extra hdd if you wish to add one. it s not touchscreen its keyboard is nicely arranged silent and backlit which is nice but what i don t like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers. i have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good. this laptop is so silent its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load thanks to the generation intel core which draws less power thus less heat. it can run games really well. well not really well. mobas like dota and smite can be run on max quality settings with fps or more. medium settings on titles like tomb raider for it to be acceptable fps is the minimum acceptable fps #pcmasterrace . it s lightweight and easy to carry around. the screen is a matte display which is nice but with poor viewing angle. i find myself adjusting it regularly. it looks sleek and gorgeous. blends in with any accessory you use with it. all in all i am very happy with this purchase. and with this price i don t think you can buy anything better. all i can say is i am impressed. very quick to get it up and running with a minimum setup time right after you open the box. it s worth it. pay me now pay me later.........i am happy with my choice going with this laptop. i was disappointed. it seemed like a great computer and a great deal. the first one arrived and it did not work. the space bar sticks. i find it hard to navigate from screen to screen. for a noncomputer savvy person it was very disappointing. i like the inch macbooks. its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable. the new mac os mountain lion has some nice features as wel as the trackpad. i didn t think i would need an optical drive but since i have had it i used it several times. the magnetic lid and charger is cool and battery indicator on the side is cool. the mac is light and so compact i thought i would regret not buying a retina display not in the least the mac pro works just fine. the os is easy and offers all kinds of surprises. i ve been using apple s since and this is the fastest and best one i ve had. this mac allows all of that. this is very fast high performance computer. this should be more than enough computer for almost everyone. i would not hesitate recommending this to anyone. it fast and easy to set up. i had cloned my data from my old computer using carbon copy cloner ccc and simply moved everything to the new computer and was off and running at speeds i had only dreamed up before. the mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized lazy and eye candy person in all of us. the macbook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like a friendly guide. if you want to use the internet then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon. this computer is amazing for the individual who does not want to do any extra work via their understanding of their laptop. i would ve given stars had it not been for the hours of updates i ve had to do to this upon arrival. other than that i love it. it s portable reliable and great for what i use it for. positives no matter what position this laptop will stay in it. it s very sturdy. quick bootup and runs efficiently. touchscreen is great. negatives as aforementioned my only con was the updates. everything you d expect from a mac. it looks and feels solid with a flawless finish. the screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down. only had it a few weeks but doesn t leave my side. this machine is flawless fast and classy. out of all the laptops i have owned this is by far the best i m not sure if it was covered in the description but it does have a backlit keyboard and i m getting about an hour battery life on one charge except i don t use this for games or videos which obviously would drain the battery faster . it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid. the screen has an extremely high resolution that i m very pleased with. even though macbooks are expensive you will see that they are well worth the money. you will not regret buying this computer my daughter s macbook air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago. it took days to make an appointment at the local apple store. i m not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand for a new battery to replace it and for a new keyboard. i could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so i went to the apple store myself and asked for a manager. he explained to me the battery expansion is normal . apple doesn t cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their apple care. the battery is simply considered consumable and not covered. i asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the macbook air on the internet with the description that apple doesn t consider the product defective. his reply astonished me looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said make sure you have your facts straight before you smear he didn t specify who are they but from the tone of his voice and his posture it indicated something between the swat team and a bunch of lawyers. here is my take on all of this the business model apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from china hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school call them geniuses and bully everybody who complains about their product. steve jobs is dead so is apple. no more apple devices in my household. please google macbook battery bulge explode before you buy your next apple toy. i ve been spoiled by the build quality and stability of macintosh and even this used computer is a gem. i can bat around all the things that everyone else says but it s been what we ve been using for decades and i have nothing bad to say. it churns out hd content runs without many flaws and i ve yet to get a virus on a mac since i started using the platform in the early s. my macbook s motherboard fried but i think that was a sugar spill that i never bothered cleaning up. that s the only issue i ve ever had since working on macs in that s a pretty impressive track record don t you think however the hp envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more. i have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all. while the price may seem high it is worth every penny with its many perks. the pros a ton of storage space this laptop comes with of memory and a tb hard drive. that is plenty of space for your laptop which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers. capability the ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus. if you are looking to get a laptop this is the laptop you should consider. i love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies without having the keyboard in the way of things. i find it much easier to type on and much more durable. battery life my battery life is really good with this laptop and i have had no problems with it thus far. i can usually go about hours before i get down to battery life. the cons no disc drive call me old fashioned but i still enjoy listening to physical cds and uploading them to itunes. however i can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive. overall i definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop. the touchscreen and capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes. it also is nice to be able to play candy crush or angry birds when in between classes straight from your laptop. it makes it much more exciting to play i m actually writing this review on my new macbook and i love it the computer it self is amazing. it is an older model so know that upfront but it is everything i was looking for. from the moment i received this macbook it was like a dream come true. i know once i upgrade the ram to it will pick up a lot. also if after reading some reviews and doing some research i found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus. so long story short if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop. i know people were complaining that it isn t the newest model but it all depends on what you are looking for. i highly recommend this computer is a fantastic tool for word processing searching the internet and keeping track of everyday life. it s also incredibly light has a battery that can last for days and looks like a piece of art. though that s pretty much what your paying for a well designed device. when you look at the internal specs the computer is only worth about it has a gb storage capacity but with the option of a gb hard drive and a dualcore intel core so don t expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too. if your looking to be a trendy hipster who can t live without a mac it s a great buy. it mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don t need. pros nice looks. keyboard is great i wanted a simple full hd display and this one does its job sound is great and this has a extra slot for hdd no cd drive. cons web cam. vga really asus you don t want to show this to anyone . anyway i don t use webcam much so i don t care viewing angles are not great. remember its a dual core. the fan kicks in even its not too hot. i found the track pad not great. i use my mouse so not a problem for me. over all very good system and worth it. this was the only tabletstyle computer so far which met my requirements. i was seduced by this computer so i took it home. the wireless keyboard not bluetooth but rf did not pair up with the device. it still did not pair. i even ran it as administrator still no effect. i used the ctrlesc keys while turning on and still nothing. it flickers briefly to green before the light goes out. i still can t pair it. i don t want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional. sony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while i get my money back for a defective product. but sony doesn t seem to have addressed it. my first mac computer and as many before me i just fall in love with it. changed the memory from gb to gb corsair vengeance and gb hdd rpm with seagate hybride gb hdd ssd. machine is flying and with parallels desktop i have my old pc notebook completely functional on my mbp. way to go and enjoy both worlds. this asus you re looking at right here and that i m typing on right now has one. with that being said for the price you get a nice fast laptop but if you ask me it s missing some things that i feel should be automatically included this laptop has no touchscreen optical drives ok a bit of a stretch because that would eat up precious space in this monster swivel or detachable screen what this laptop does have is windows which is confusing as all getout tons of this is really nice but i hate the awkward right mouse clicking.. sometimes it works sometimes it doesn t.. may be the laptop may be the laptop in conjunction with windows either way highly annoying. i hooked up a usb mouse and all is well. all works beautifully but windows is taking a bit of getting used to. love the degree rotation and the touch screen works great but a little bit of a learning curve there too as sometimes i have to tap a few times to get the exact location i need... overall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop the mouse was the only negative i could really see ... this is a fantastic transformer i loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows platform. the only reason i returned it was because i bought it to use the touchscreen with photoshop and because of the program it could not utilize the touchscreen within the work space except to zoom and rotate. i would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase. it s a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen. i m looking forward to needing a laptop update so i can purchase this computer again. i ve only had this for a week overall i like the computer it s thin &amp; light and the wireless keyboard works great. i was impressed; sony puts in small touches like a usb charging port on the charger. one thing i did t like is the stylus holder it s cheap plastic and doesn t seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the usb port. i do t use it i think i would accidently break it and loose my stylus. the other issue i had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it. awesome laptop for college can be used for gaming as well. it s light fast and has great battery it s a steal when considering the specs and performance as well. the processor and gpu are fantastic at running games and multiple apps. i can run most games to a good quality without seeing any lack of speed. the backlit keyboard is a nice touch especially. make sure to only handle this computer with clean hands because the front cover can get oily pretty fast. i m overall very pleased with my new laptop the only downside are the speakers. they don t go very loud at all. the quality of the sound is nice but the lack of volume really kills it for me. this is mostly not an issue since i mainly use earbuds anyways however it could be annoying at times. the screen looked fine to me and wasn t an issue like others have been saying. overall great for me this laptop has delivered. i immediately did the windows upgrade and haven t had any issues. the wireless adapter is strong and the ssd is fast. this thing boots in just a few seconds which is nice. others have mentioned issues with viewing angle on the screen but i never use the laptop where i m not looking straight at it so it doesn t bother me. i m very pleased with the purchase. boot time is super fast around anywhere from seconds to minute. apps launch super fast and the hdd is more than sufficient. i usually use my mac for school work and internet browsing so the entrylevel macbook pro is already more than what i expected from a computer i would typically use it for. macs hardly ever get viruses and they are completely incompatible with existing microsoft windows viruses. furthermore mac os x mountain lion s gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed. the keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are backlit which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing typing . overall the screen resolution though nonretina is sufficient for normal web browsing and work. the thunderbolt port is awesome us comes with the mbp and has transfer rates of up to other ports include firewire gigabit ethernet magsafe port microphone jack. sdhc card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs. the glass track pad is large enough for apple s highly acclaimed multitouch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers. for windows users switching to a mac you can also enable right clicking known to apple as secondary click in the system preferences&gt; mouse and enabling right clicking. the unique to apple aluminium unibody is a real beauty. it makes the mbp very durable and protects it from scratches though you shouldn t go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it. the mac app store and itunes store are phenomenal. the mac app store is your onestop shop for mac software though you can also download software online at your own risk. there are currently around apps on the app store and counting... and billions of songs available for download fro the itunes store. itunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it s simple to use user interface. i m sure you won t regret making this purchase. one of the worst pieces of electronics i have ever bought. very pour performance. it takes for ever to wake it up. sometimes it stops receiving wifi signal so i have to restart it. it is very slow and not responsive. would not recommend. glare is also pretty frustrating. there is definitely more to say... i tested it it worked great. he received it and one day later it dies. the laptop refuses to start we have troubleshooted all areas still fails to start. cannot even get to bios. just a click and a black screen. of course it dies days past the return window. we got two days of operation from this laptop. when the macbook pro arrived i helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the pc to the mac... an easy draganddrop process utilizing a flash drive. it was delivered with of ram on each of two sticks which was probably adequate. so i simply pulled one stick from the machine and installed the stick in its place. the machine now has gigs of ram and it works just fine. but hey it s an apple. i wouldn t expect anything less if it was possible to give them start i would have done it. my laptop s one of the key from keyboard came out and it was mechanical failure. my laptop was under coverage but when i gave it to them for repairs they quoted me for it. this company just wants customers money in their pocket. they dont care how you feel when they charge you hundreds of hard earned dollars. i wish this company to go bust. i will never ever buy any apple product in my life. overall i love it. first when i move the screen to put it in tablet position the hinge doesn t seem totally solid. i feel like i need to be really gentle with it but maybe that s just me. also and this maybe is another personal quirk but the keyboard sits a little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop. first off amazing laptop three years ago i had purchased this bad boy and it still runs great if i were to have any technical difficulties the local apple and contact line were able to help me asap it was quite impressive. i myself had purchased the gig drive laptop and as a dj with thousands of songs pictures and other things...and after years i have managed to fill around of my gigs. there is so much room pros amazing storage both and gig ram needed if you are as productive as i am dj photography movie making etc its quick no anti spyware needed never had a virus and i never will build solid and durable bought the year warranty and boy it was needed because of my doings cons. if you fall behind in updates your laptop will become progressively slower just update it...then its back to normal sometimes when i stared mine up it would take a few extra minutes to boot on other times it is a few seconds cannot manually take battery out unless you work for apple or have the tools overall it is a fantastic laptop. mine has been though hundreds of parties weddings quinces anything involving performances it can take it this laptop was made for art music beatmaking pictures movies graphic design. by the way it comes with apps and hardware that can already support what i had just listed. this laptop will last you a half decade if not a full decade. soon i will be hitting the year mark and i think this thing can make it another in my opinion. get this now by the way...i paid for this particular laptop roughly grand...look at the price now this is a great laptop. i bought it for college and couldn t be happier. the ssd and complement each other really well. i was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows but it is pretty awesome. if you are looking for a light durable and extremely effecient laptop buy this one they really know what they are doing. the laptop is so easy to work with. like it was designed for what people would want to the system to do very userfriendly. its simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great aside from its quality design and sexy looks. if you dont like windows i would suggest trying a mac. the investment is worth it. have bought several laptops in last several years and hands down this has been the best ever. mac user interface is just the best. also the laptop is quite no more burnt laps best screen display and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over. only thing i dislike is that everything for mac is expensive but i guess you pay for quality not impressed with macintosh products. in fact i am completely frustrated. also many software programs are not compatible with the ios platform. be sure the programs you need will work on a mac before you buy one i had heard people speak highly of the macbook pro for college students and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use. the macbook pro is useful for college students for many reasons it is the cheapest product in the line of macbook s the new operating system called snow leopard is installed and ready for use the battery life has increased from the last version from hours to hours making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger. reliability throughout the past few years i have had no problems with the macbook pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws. durability my computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it. usability the macbook pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who doesn t necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers. the processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly. the macbook pro has a significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes pros o it usually runs very smoothly but apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers. o it has an extended battery life. o it is extremely user friendly. cons o some people don t enjoy the way the processing system runs but don t have any issues with getting it to function. o others have problems with the applications depending what they need to use the device for for example engineering majors need extra applications &amp; systems to do some work but they are easily downloadable. my first laptop ever and it is a flips into a tablet mode also brilliant. so far so good. battery doesn t hold up to what it said in the description but i got it refurb d and i imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price just a guess . still getting used to typing on it my palms keep hitting the mousepad and causing the cursor to jump and moving me off of where i was typing. plenty of ports and since this is my first laptop i really don t have anything to compare it to. note no dvd drive no ethernet port screen is too small to read and almost impossible to touch with a normal adult finger. the brightest screen setting appeared dim in normal room light. keyboard is flimsy and mediocre at best. the touch pad feel is a on scale computer seemed sluggish for an intel core device. power on good luck finding it. i would run back to computer store and return this expensive toy. signed not impressed i bought this a few months ago and it s holding up fairly well. runs fast the touch screen hasn t lost any sensitivity i m overall very happy with it. this one doesn t do that. the trackpad is pretty crappy but aren t they all this is my first apple computer and i couldn t be more pleased. ios does everything its billed to do and much much more. literally every detail has been thought out and designed with the user in mind. i can t believe how much time it saves me through automatic processes. the computer of the people i love this laptop. the batter lasts as long as claimed. i get about or so hours playing the sims. i haven t really officially tested it yet but it s a long time. i hate plugging my laptop in because i don t want to leave it on too long and hurt the battery but with this laptop i rarely have to charge it. the touchscreen is responsive and even works with my crappy dollar stylus. the only problem i have is with windows i hate windows it made me sign up with microsoft and sometimes won t let me download things that are harmful to my computer but that s what anti virus software is for lol. the wifi rumor hasn t happened to me. the wifi works great. it feels very well built. the metal is very expensive feeling. the laptop is a little more than an inch thick when closed. i m a very weak girl and i could lift this laptop with one hand however i d get tired soon lol. the screen is not good for carrying around in your bare hands. i bought my first macbook exactly months ago and was really happy with my new toy but what was not my surprise when i turned it on days ago and the screen was completely black. i can hear the noise of the computer turning on and the lights also turn on but the screen in completely dead. the best computer i ve ever bought. the simple look of icons and format makes it easy to navigate through programs and download files. the only issue i had was with the harddrive. the harddrive crashed and i thought i had lost the whole computer. replacing the harddrive in this laptop is extremely easy a couple screws on the back to remove the backplate and the harddrive is pretty much plug and play. and apple was happy to install the latest osx for free you wont be disappointed with this computer it s just a matter of getting used to the touchpad commands. thankfully i have earphones and an external amplifier for audio; the onboard speakers are just terrible. but what should i expect from a unit that is this thin and this light the most disappointing purchase of my life i received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after i purchased this horrible machine. within the first few months that i bought it there was clearly a problem with the hard drive. the online customer service was awful. gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile. no one would ever answer my question as to why i couldn t get another new macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my macbook was still under warranty. as a matter of fact no matter how many times i asked that question the employees i spoke purposely ignored it. they didn t say yes and they didn t say no they just pretended that i never asked it which was incredibly frustrating. i ve been to the bar several times they have been very nice . they have now basically replaced everything inside my machine told me there was a problem with the hardware so i now have a machine. maybe i m not being reasonable but i don t feel that s the same as a new computer because i didn t pay for a refurbished computer. i still have weird freezing problems with it and it s pretty slow but it s not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in. i had delusions of grandeur regarding apple s customer and the of their etc.. etc...blah...blah... i m sure most people s macbooks work just fine but fyi if you get the factory dud you re stuck with it and no one at apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away. one os for this platform no oem os paraphernalia and automatic updates. i am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the mac well she was right whatever in the world took me so long to get a computer that just works. i m no power user but i have had no learning curve with the mac and i don t do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the os. i did buy office for the mac at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for and that was a steal in my opinion. otherwise i am happily a mac user. for a premium laptop sold in the apple macbook pro inch base model is about as basic as it gets no ssd no discrete graphics no display and no touch screen. but apple does not pretend it has any of these. what it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side apple s osx mountain lion the sleek looks apple always delivers reasonable specs good battery life nice keyboard and excellent trackpad. those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use macs. the macbook pro inch laptop is for those who want to use a mac but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution. this mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair. hard drives can be replaced ram can be added as needed and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge. this added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money detracts from the computer s value. lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a fivestar purchase but for the price this is a four star good computer. tldr version good reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive. i am really sorry i bought this machine. i was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase. this machine has made me go there times and has been nothing but a continuous problem. finally they are sending it in for a motherboard replacement. it s a lemon . so i m cooled on mac buys. they did not replace the motherboard. instead they tightened a loose wire. it also has a big new scratch on the top cover. i started it up and it still has the same problem i went in to fix. so i m going back to genius bar for visit i think it may have to be apple don t care instead of apple care. you get what you pay for right mac is complicated and frustrating at moments. i watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough. i should have known better. i hope you don t make the same mistake... when i first got the computer i noticed the tracking pad was hard to click. i took my macbook to the apple store and they had to replace the battery after month of use since it was swelling. they tried to tell me that the battery wasn t covered by the warranty and it costs about to replace. they ended up not charging me. other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long i m pretty happy with the computer. i m a designer turned frontend developer and this computer is unusable for frontend development. opening photoshop takes fooooooorrrever as do all programs that do not begin with an i . the free upgrade to mountain lion failed. it tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again. before and after i resolved that issue i saw the damn beachball all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell it s doing while i wait for it. i spend so much time waiting for it. i can t believe people like these computers. now that they are not virus free ... l i see absolutely no benefit to apple products as they are slower more expensive and do not last as long. don t waste your money. my hp seemed great at first then the problems started.....wireless adapter would just &quot;disappear&quot; and the system said it didn t have a network card. sometimes it comes back sometimes not. hp was no help. the lettering wore off the keys so you better be able to type blind. the battery lasted months then pffft.....gone. when i had a boot up issue the hp recovery didn t work. the disks i made wouldn t work.....hp support stated &quot;we re a hardware company not a software company.&quot; then there was a power cord recall....hp never notified us.....and we did register......never again. i don t have the inclination or time to devote to a companies tech support search functions or hold times.....dropped the hp and never looked back. i gave this product stars because i have been looking for a macbook pro for a long time and i found it here for a wonderful price. i have used this product for only days but i can t wait to use it more. i really like mac/apple products because of their operating system. i can tweet and use facebook from the sidebar which is really nice. i also like i have the option to push calendars photos and contacts to an ipad ipod touch or iphone if i had any of those . the only thing i have had trouble with so far is transferring music to itunes which i would have liked to do though i used itunes on a computer separate from my linux computer but i could not figure that out. i just ended up using my ipod to transfer my itunes music and i redownloaded my amazon music losing my ratings . i have not tried gaming on it but i have heard that mac/apple does not do games well. i plan on using my macbook pro for a long time. when i decided to buy my first computer i wish i had bought a mac first. if the price doesn t deter you you ll find it well worth it in terms of troublefree operation. i ve had it for more than a year and i ve found that no antivirus software is needed as long as you don t download anything without being sure that it s from a legitimate source. from time to time i get the spinning beach ball that holds up progress. i can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the show all bookmarks icon the open book icon at the upper left . once in a long while that doesn t work; in that case i turn the computer off then on again and sign in problem solved. i ll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself and just conclude by saying that i m delighted with my purchase. received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed. to go left i have to go right and vice versa and to go up i have to go down. when i attach a mouse it s fine but the touchpad is really annoying. i went through the settings and there isn t a way to fix it. it s a great laptop but right now it s annoying to use the touchpad.'"

              "'judging from previous posts this used to be a good place but not any longer . we there were four of us arrived at noon the place was empty and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude . they never brought us complimentary noodles ignored repeated requests for sugar and threw our dishes on the table . the food was lousy too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny . after all that they complained to me about the small tip . avoid this place i have eaten at saul many times the food is always consistently outrageously good . saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn . the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world . the wine list is interesting and has many good values . for the price you can not eat this well in manhattan . i was very disappointed with this restaurant . ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away . i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested . food was okay nothing great . chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family . i/we will never go back to this place again . went on a day oyster binge with fish bringing up the closing and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended because it was so great service was devine oysters where a sensual as they come and the price ca n t be beat you ca n t go wrong here . every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant saul on smith street . everything is always cooked to perfection the service is excellent the decor cool and understated . i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible . ca n t wait wait for my next visit . i had my eyes on this place promising myself i will one day ` give it a try . and i hate to say this but i doubt i ll ever go back . the food is very average ... the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet every thing they serve is too sweet here . the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree . i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty lrb could ve used a bit more salt rrb . anyways if you re in the neighborhood to eat good food i would n t waste my time trying to find something rather go across the street to tamari . the decor is night tho ... but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite unappetizing and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern . we ate outside at haru s sake bar because haru s restaurant next door was overflowing . what s the difference between the two their sake list was extensive but we were looking for purple haze which was n t listed but made for us upon request the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome great appetizer to share we went around on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great we love th pink pony . the perfect spot . foodawesome . service friendly and attentive . ambiance relaxed and stylish . do n t judge this place prima facie you have to try it to believe it a home away from home for the literate heart . i have eaten here a handful of times for no reason besides sheer convenience . lrb i hang out and live in the neighborhood . rrb the food is decent . however it s the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth . i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of selfrespect which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water or the check . i know you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored but my agenda is i m here to eat and enjoy the company of friends seeking a pleasant experience . well i did n t find it there and trust i have told everyone i can think of about my experience . the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty hmmm . this place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area . i had a great experience . food is great . service is top notch . i have been going back again and again . i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin which was heavenly at sushi rose . it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistencynot too fishy creamy and slightly buttery . the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned . the rice to fish ration was also good they did n t try to overpack the rice . we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it . i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently . she lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy . surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth . in the evening this place attracted a well dressed with it ny crowd . the food was well prepared and the service impecable . i m going back . having hunted around for a quiet romantic yet not hideously expensive restaurant i stumbled across reviews for la lanterna and gave it a shot . quite simply it s like stepping out of manhattan and into a haven of tranquility . the service was attentive yet unimposing the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced . the prix fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough lrb both in quantity and quality rrb . i will be going back and heartily recommend it i ve had the lunch buffet at chennai a couple of times when i have been in the neighborhood . it is terrific as is the value . $ and there is much tasty food all of it fresh and continually refilled . i am not a vegetarian but almost all the dishes were great . frankly when you compare what you can have here for lunch versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city there is no comparison . go hungry and enjoy . the food here is rather good but only if you like to wait for it . i like the somosas chai and the chole but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing . the service varys from day to day sometimes they re very nice and sometimes not . the kitchen however is almost always slow . also specify if you like your food spicy its rather bland if you do n t . the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation so a casual lunch here would probably be best . just went here for my girlfriends bday . if you ve ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer . add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening . the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it . once you step into cosette you re miraculously in a small offthebeaten path parisian bistro . this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets with that certain parisian flair . the food was average to aboveaverage ; the french onion soup filling yet not overly impressive and the desserts not brilliant in any way . however go for the ambience and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world i have never eaten in the restaurant however upon reading the reviews i got take out last week . it was horrible . the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n t even fully melted it looked like shredded cheese partly done still in strips . i have eaten at many pizza places around nyc and this is hands down the worst . this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn . the pizza is overpriced and soggy . yes they use fancy ingredients but even fancy ingredients do n t make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right . a big disappointment all around . i think i ve had some the best meals of my life at minnow . the seafood is amazing there s a good wine list and the everchanging menu always offers some great surprises . the combination of superfresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious . worth the trip from manhattan . was there friday night . best pastrami i ever had and great portion without being ridiculous . and i ve been to many nyc delis . my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it . price no more than a jersey deli but way better . as a japanese native i ve lived in the tristate area for over years but i was just so amazed at this place . this place is the most japanese it can ever get . the signs the specials menus food and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese . this place is worth an onehour drive . i am so coming back here again as much as i can . leon is an east village gem casual but hip with well prepared basic french bistro fare good specials a warm and lively atmosphere . my wife and i always enjoy the young not always well trained but nevertheless friendly staff all of whom have a story . sit outside in the warm weather ; inside for cozy winter . decent wine at reasonable prices . have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience . our teenage kids love it too . everytime i decide to try another place on the ues i get angry that i did n t just go to zucchero pomodori . this is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood . the service is excellent the decor is great and the food is delicious and comes in large portions . you ll pay at least double at any other italian restaurant in the city and most still do n t compare . i m partial to the gnocchi . this place is incredibly tiny . they refuse to seat parties of or more on weekends . the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive . the food was bland oily . i just do n t understand all the hype ... . we went to ino for valentines . we have been to this place many times and always have great food wine and service . we were worried we would have trouble getting in but somehow managed to have a short wait . as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited . when we sat we got great and fast service . the people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes . make sure you try this place as often as you can . this is a fun restaurant to go to . the pizza is yummy and i like the atmoshpere . but the pizza is way to expensive . a large is $ and toppings are about $ each . i went there for lunch and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read . sauce was watery and the food did n t have much flavor . if you like the food and the value you get from some of chinatown restaurants this is not the place for you . i do n t think i would go again . this place is great . i had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of . the waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal service was prompt friendly and great . slightly on the pricey side but worth it great pizza and fantastic service . there was a small wait but shorter than i expected . located at the end of a magnificent block . very cozy and warm inside ... . i will be back this is the best sushi in new york city hands down . the place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic . get the tuna of gari . the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side . planet thailand has always been a hit with me i go there usually for the sushi which is great the thai food is excellent too . with the great variety on the menu i eat here often and never get bored . the atmosphere is n t the greatest but i suppose that s how they keep the prices down . it s all about the food i went there with my friend last saturday . first it took us a long time to find the place . we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers . but when we looked at the menu there were n t a lot of choices most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section . then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi . those rolls were big but not good and sashimi was n t fresh . they were dry and disgusting i did n t even finish my first piece . hurley s is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came . try the crunchy tuna it is to die for . try everything for that matter it is all good . i have been going there since it opened and i ca n t get enough . first went here to enjoy their garden terrace . the food was amazing and the service was prompt and helpful but not overbearing or rushed . the steak tartare is a great bet they fix it for you at the table . admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm but the open kitchen is part of the charm . great wine selection gigondas is worth the price and the house champagne is a great value . it may be a bit packed on weekends but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area . have recommended the place to friends always gets good response . pizza the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional toppings the crust tastes like the best freshly baked bread veal parmigana better than patsy s much more reasonably priced too i take all my nyc guests to vt s . not sure where the previous reviewer lonk dined but saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food i ve been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences . i d highly recommend it for a special occasion it provides and intimate setting and nice service . i m not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and i all enjoy mizu very much ... and we re repeat customers . even after they overcharged me the last time i was there . make sure you have the spicy scallop roll ... . it s delicious moules were excellent lobster ravioli was very salty took my mom for mother s day and the maitre d was pretty rude . told us to sit anywhere and when we sat he said the table was reserved . stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting . tiny dessert was $ ... just plain overpriced for what it is . the drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced . try their chef s specials they are to die for . service is not exactly five star but thats not really a big deal . downstairs lounge is always a good attraction . raga s is a romantic cozy restaurant . the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations . it is also extremely well priced . the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive . the bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines . this is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed . your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem when we stumbled on leon we thought that we had found quite the gem but we were certainly wrong . the waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet we were told no ... . then to top things off she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend s jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes . such a disappointment ... . rude service medicore food ... there are tons of restaurants in ny ... stay away from this one . i had a grat time at jekyll and hyde i loved everythig about itespecially the shows and actors . our server was very helpful and friendly . i am bringing my whole family back next time . the food was good too . the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent . the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by feet away on avenue on a cool evening was wonderful . inside is a little cramped but to be expected . service was prompt and courteous . this was a repeat visit and we ll definitely be back again . great service great food . prices are in line . compared to other shabu restaurants around town this places wins handsdown . but too far east i live a block away and go to patsy s frequently . the pizza is delicious they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap frozen shredded cheese common to most pizzaria s . two complaints their appetizer selection stinks it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu . also because it is so thin it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling . so eat fast and order a lot . wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaurant . fine dining restaurant quality . over different choices to create your own . a must try on a recent sunday afternoon a friend and i accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt . this was the perfect quiet relaxing and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater . the chicken pot pie is excpetiona the cheeseburger huge and delictable and the service professional wan warm . with so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district is truly an excellent find we will return many times for this oasis in midtown . i grew up on these bagels . the staff is no nonsense . the food options rule . when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else . worth visiting the ave spot because it is the original store . i stumbled upon this second floor walkup two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from l.a. . being serious sushi lovers we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action . i asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if i like uni . lrb for those of you who do n t know uni is sea urchin in japanese which happens to be my favorite . rrb he served me an uni hand roll which i never had before and let me tell you ... it was heaven aside from the sea urchin the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail boton shrimp blue fin torro lrb fatty tuna rrb sea eel etc. . the sake menu should not be overlooked all in all this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city . try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll . we visited orsay during ny restaurant week and tried their $ menu . service was very good prompt attentive and nonintrusive . food was very good as well considering that we tried the budget selection lrb though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer so that fat was more of a meltinyourmouth experience rrb . wine list selection is good and winebytheglass was generously filled to the top . traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation . i ve been to at cafe spice probably times it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square . to sum it up service varies from good to mediorce depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average ok . seating is always prompt though the restaurant does fill up in the evening . food is usually very good though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders . as many other reviewers noticed your order is often slow to arrive this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time . the decor is vibrant and eyepleasing with several semiprivate boths on the right side of the dining hall which are great for a date . i have never been disappointed in the red eye . the first time i went and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere i ordered the lobster cobb salad . i ve never ordered anything else from their menu ... there s no need to . it s simply the best meal in nyc . you can not go wrong at the red eye grill . if we were to move from the upper east side we would genuinely miss this restaurant . we ve lived in the area for more than years . the restaurant is cute but not upscale . the food is a diamond in rough the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes . i would highly recommend it . it s one of our favorite places to eat in ny . we had a great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night . we were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks . after really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner . the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile . the place s decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh . i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks if you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained this is a great place to go and eat . my husband and i thougt it would be great to go to the jekyll and hyde pub for our anniversary and to our surprise it was fantastic . the have over different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini . the entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner . please take my advice go and try this place . its located in greenewich village . you will not be disapointed at all . our first time in new york and we had to try a new york bagel . we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem . the bagel was huge . they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior . the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese lrb gets a little messy rrb . i loved it and would highly recommend . this was my frist time at cafe st. bart s and i must say how delicous the food and the service was . when i called this morning i did n t think i would be able to get in at but i was able to get in along with four other guests . i have to highly recommend the lobster roll not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster . other guests enjoyed pizza santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips . i highly recommend cafe st. bart s for their food the ambience and wonderful service . all the staff is absolutely professional i sometimes see the waiters do n t have enough knowledge of their dishes . but they do . lrb that is a must but not every restaurant can do ... rrb . if you want to dine with large party i recommend to make reservation basement . there s nice and quiet small but enough for lrb or more rrb . this restaurant was way overhyped . my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily . okayi do n t mind the oily part lrb cause most are cooked that way rrb but it was way too bland . the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary . the service was the only thing good about this restaurant . it s boring on the inside and our sushi was pretty below average ... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor . i definitely would n t go back . there are many thai places in the city but so far toons is # . their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic . the price is reasonable although the service is poor . fresh restaurant was amazing ... ... food was delicious and of course fresh . great for a romantic evening or a fun evening with friends ... . i will be going back very soon . keep up the good work . hats off to the chef . i am not the most experienced person when it comes to thai food but my friend who took me there is . he has visited thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine . it was wonderful . the salads are delicious both refreshing and very spicy . we had pam s special fried fish and it was amazing . too large for just two people but nothing was left . unbelievable . had a late night dinner on a saturday night . great vibe lots of people . my husband and i both ordered the steak medium . my husbands was perfect my was well done and dry . i did n t complain i liked the atmosphere so much . will give it another chance before i write it off . visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews . on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch . ambience is so cute and quaint good for business although we were there on vacation . salads were fantastic . although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great . ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me . we will be back . this is some really good inexpensive sushi . it costs $ extra to turn a regular roll into an insideout roll but the roll more than triples in size and that s not just from the rice . the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i ve had at this price range . the yellowtail was particularly good as well . i have reservations about the all you can eat deal however the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ by just going off the menu . in any event this is a place i ll be sure to stop by again when i m in this part of town . big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment . they have it all great price food and service . the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can . the food is prepared quickly and efficiently . and it all comes at a very reasonable price lrb congee noodles and rice dishes are no more than $ each rrb . the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well . this place is always very crowded and popular . went here on a friend s reccomendation . enjoyed a very nice caesar salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese ... both very tasty . we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh . we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake both were delicious . we d go back again . i recently went to this restaurant with some coworkers for lunch and had an amazing time . the staff was accomodating the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely . we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves . yes the prices are high but i felt it was worth it . we all felt it was worth it . sometimes i get good food and ok service . sometimes i get bad food and bad service sometimes i get good good and bad service . it is not consistent . really depends on your luck the place is a bistro which means simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere . and where does patis go wrong ; no where . you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but cassuolet steake fritte tripe stew etc ; simple stuff . and evaluated on those terms pastis is simply wonderful . right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza . mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta lrb raddichio was kind of bitter though rrb . my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better . the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day . kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids . overall i would recommend it and go back again . coming from boston this place is like emma s pizza in kendall square in cambridge lrb although they have more funky toppings rrb i started out with a bombay beer which was big enough for two . for dinner i had the chicken tikkamasala and some garlic naan . mmmmm ... it was delicious . service was slow but the people were friendly . it s a nice place to relax and have conversation . i ca n t wait to go back . we have lived in chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant . the food is authentic italian delicious pizza is terrific as is homemade pasta . ambience is delightful service impeccable . i m still mad that i had to pay for lousy food . the hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed . service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great . do not try unless you re just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste . i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try . this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent . the filet mignon dish was superb i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices . it s a small cute restaurant . i absolutely love this place from the street it looks very hidden and is actually an old warehouse . i like the ambience it s very dark and original . i came here for my friend s birthday and keep coming back ever since . the sushi is amazing and amazingly cheap . big thumbs up very affordable and excellent ambient we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai . we were very disappointed . we wo n t go to this place again for a good meal . however i think this place is a good hang out spot . next time we would n t dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks . my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time the pizza and wine were excellentthe service too but what really made this place was the backyard dining area . it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants i have ever seen in ny i am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country . they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter so i m looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it . check this place out highly recommended first of all this place is * not * romantic as claimed by citysearch s editorial review . either that or the editor s idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table while trying to speak louder than the traffic on . the tables are crammed way too close the menu is typical of any italian restaurant and the wine list is simply overpriced . slightly above average wines start at $ with only one selection listed at $ . service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category . for instance plates were just dumped on the table i was handed the wine list upside down etc ... . somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service . to be completely fair the only redeeming factor was the food which was above average but could n t make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora . to celebrate a birthday three of us went to mare anticipating great food . not one of our meals was edible bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring . fish was overdone . cute place nice wait staff but would never go there again . someone else recommended the dessert we also left that . one of us actually liked the expresso that s it . skip this restaurant it s a big disappointment . myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the city ; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else . i ve never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious . their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for . i come from a family of pizzeria owners and i m almost ashamed to say that the pizza in fornino s blows my families receipies away . it is simply amazing . the place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious . i highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try . you will find yourself returning quite often . p.s. please do n t tell anyone in my family i eat there . lol . a restaurant that does n t try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere . no gimmicks here the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation . the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over how refreshing the service was impeccable and unobtrusive the staff knows what they are there to do to know their menu present your meal and attend to your needs . looking around i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen . beautiful experience . the view is breathtaking the service is top notch ... the ambiance is wonderfull . the staff offers impeccable service . i had lobster bisque it has oz of maine lobster in it . my boyfriend had the new england chowder it was good but i think the award should go to the lobster bisque . i had filet mignon with garlic mash . it was divine melts in your mouth . my boyfriend had prime rib it was good . we did n t want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of korbett it was just enough . we had lava cake ... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a to make it . it s cuz it s so good you need to taste it all in all we re already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food . if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo . it s very spicy but not offensive . we will definitely go back . go to volare for class service and terrific food . the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter . the wine list is excellent . the food is amazing ... especially if you get the chef s tasting menu and your favourite bottle lrb or two rrb of wine from an extensive selection of wines . the place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded but the service is excellent and it s great for friends out a romantic date or a special occassion . people dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans . the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n t like . recommendations of course are required please be aware that it s cash or amex only with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering the food here was decent not great . the menu is very limited i think we counted or entrees . we ordered the special grilled branzino that was so infused with bone it was difficult to eat . the decor in this place is very dinerish and the kind of place you expect in the east village not romantic just simple small and sparse . problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable . no plans to return anytime soon . this place is so much fun . our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant . this place must have cost the owners afortune to build . i think the stuff was better than disney . our food was great too and really large portions . the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york . we will go back every time we are in the city . if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde . it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects . the food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions . i highly recommend it . i am going to the mid town location next . the place is a lot of fun . my six year old loved it . the characters really make for an enjoyable experience . the food however is what one might expect . it is very overpriced and not very tasty . however i think jeckll and hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once . we had a good time . went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them . service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded . drinks way over priced . food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit . great pizza for lunch place . service was quick . the pizza was great . and it was quick which is very important . have the iced tea . it was wonderful . whenever you need a sushi fix mizu will be there with quality fish and great service . delivery is fast too . great friendly service fast seating fast delivery excellent sushi . a little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite . growing up in ny i have eaten my share of bagels . essabagel lrb either by stytown or midtown rrb is by far the best bagel in ny . the bagels always warm soft on the inside crispy on the outside and enormous in size . they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great . the lox is always fresh too . highly recommended to all i have to agree with the previous reviewer . i do n t get it either . not impressed with the food . prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant . zero ambiance to boot . i thought this place was totally overrated . everything we had was good or ok ... but definitely nothing great . the ambience was nice but service was n t so great . when you add it all together it just does n t seem worth it to me ... especially considering the prices . this is the best shabushabu restaurant in the trystate area . i have lived in japan for years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in japan . thius is a must for anyone who loves shabushabu . the atmosphere is nothing special but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo . the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance . despite a slightly limited menu everything prepared is done to perfection ultra fresh and a work of food art . i must give it yon out of yon stars taxan delicious arigato gozimas yuka this restaurant was recommended by a local ... as a matter of fact he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed we were n t the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food . we liked it so much that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit new york . went there for an office lunch . the location and ambience is ok but the food is what makes up for it . there is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me . try green curry with vegetables . the quantity is also very good you will come out satisfied . the service is ok some of the people did n t get what they asked for . i was there on sat for my birthday and we had an excellent time . i had the best ravioli ever . the wine the service was very good too . moderate prices . a little noise but i think that was because of our party molto bene this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list . the food is delicious from the specials to the regular menufare the dishes are never a disappointment . whether it s the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite . although the tables may be closely situated the candlelight foodquality and service overcompensate . a guaranteeed delight i have known about this secret for the last years emilio lrb the godfather rrb has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices . if you go try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce the mozzarella en carozza is mmmmmmmm ... everything is just delicious . check out the secret back room . old school meets new world . i pray it stays open forever . thank you emilio . ciao bella . i found the food service and value exceptional everytime i have been there . the food was authentic . i felt as though i were eating in paris . the service was excellent friendly and attentive . the prices are wonderfully low . very good wine choices . i ca n t believe people complain about no cheese sticks who has room for cheesesticks with the best pizza in nyc get the pepperoni yum and a family style salad . great staff . always great service i go twice a month fantastic the food is good i ca n t lie . but the staff was so horrible to us . the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out . we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order . this place is pricey and yes the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price . save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one i ll keep this short . amma is nothing special . the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place . i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive . will not be back . do n t dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes they are simply not up to par with the nonveg selections . decor is nice though service can be spotty . this place is always packed . i know because i live nearby . most importantly food is excellent . try the sea bass . highly recommended . first of all dal bukhara rocks . as a student in nyu i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by . but ive heard a lot about this for the past yrs and finally decided to eat here . i am happy i did the food was awsome . just awsome . and yes dal bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs . they are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey . but overall i give it a . . i have n t been to the other locations . haru on park s is simply disgusting . the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale . quite frankly this is some of the worst sushi i have ever tried . will never be back . honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives . believe us we ve been eating sushi for over yrs . not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly . the allucaneat sushi is definitely in very poor quality . limited menu nosofresh ingredients thinlysliced fish fallapart rice . the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce lrb even its low sodium rrb the vinegarsoaked rice and the scallion on top of the fish . the waitstaffs are nice though . wont come back again for sure i have been to roth s twice and both times were very disappointing . once for dinner and once for brunch . both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service which was boarderline rude . they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another . much of the time it seems like they do not care about you . the dinner was ok nothing i would have again . i had their eggs benedict for brunch which were the worst in my entire life i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was . this was a great surprise . with the theater blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room . the service was attentive . i look forward to eating here again . planet thai is great we love the food drinks and atmosphere the svc can be a bit rude at times esp if you have big group but overall the restaurant is a must try the pad thai it s fabulous and their prices are so cheap just because it s cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty it is great just remember the later you go the longer you may have to wait . it s popular w/the late crowd . they forgot a sandwich did n t include plastic forks and did n t include pita with the hummus platter . also the sandwiches lrb nearing $ rrb did n t come with anything like chips or a side . overall not worth the money . eating in the atmosphere saves it but at your desk it s a very disappointing experience . i love indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it . chennai garden is my favorite indian restaurant in the city . they have authentic indian at amazin prices . this restaurant is vegetarian ; there are no meat dishes whatsoever . the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches . it s a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early . patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff . the food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate . this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates . not a great place for family or general dining . lloovve this place . food is excellent . fish is so very fresh . waitstaff are very friendly . love yuka . mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood . the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent . the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great . the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing . the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices . even though its good seafood the prices are too high . the lobster sandwich is $ and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price . went to village last night for my birthday . we picked it randomly without a recommendation from someone who has been there so we were n t sure what to expect . we were very pleasantly surprised . the food was delicious lrb i had a halibut special my husband had steak rrb and the service was topnotch . when my dessert came there was a candle in it not because anyone asked for one but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort . truly the mark of an attentive waiter . i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night . we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods . we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods . why they do n t concern much of customer s health just want to make money . please do n t fool us . i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke . i recommend the jelly fish drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings certainly the stir fry blue crab . the food is so cheap and the waiters are nice . of course it is crowded but who cares . authentic shanghai style and i can not recommend a better shanghai place in new york . have frequented ` ino for several years and the food remains excellent . cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ . the large selection of bruschettas paninis tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating . lrb the asparagus truffle oil parmesan bruschetta is a winner rrb wine list is extensive without being overpriced . be sure to try the seasonal and always delicious specials . definitely a neighborhood favorite . i loved this place i almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded . the food was very good a great deal and the place its self was great . the wait staff is very freindly they make it feel like you re eating in a freindly little european town . i like cafe noir dont get me wrong it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent the service was terrible we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served . the waitress seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing . after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend asked him where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in america ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on . we did tip i guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager . the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff because despite the current one this is a great place . pizza here is consistently good . salads are a delicious way to begin the meal . you should pass on the calamari . it is thick and slightly soggy . decor is charming . service is average . what a great place . i came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband . the ambience was so fun and the prices were great on top of the fact that the food was really tasty . i was n t thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes but i guess that s the price you pay for a popular place . i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever . a gentleman maybe the manager came to our table and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order . when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants he replied this is not mcdonald s every place makes things differently . while it is understandable that every place is indeed different there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude . the service was poor restaurant poorly lit staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald s than this joint . never again i absolutely loved this place . my friends spoke so much about it for months i finally made the time to come down ear and dine in . excellent atmosphere delicious dishes good and friendly service . this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions . i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation . the wine list is also really nice . a friend from seattle and i went on a thursday night around . everything was wonderful ; food drinks staff mileau . i would highly recommend this place i have been to casimir over times and i have always had a great time there . the food is great and reasonably priced . i have tried to make reservations but both times the hostess did n t have my name . if the weather is nice try to snag an outside table . the staff has been nice but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often . my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent . from the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it . considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed . i highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service . nice family owned traditional restaurant . fresh ingredients and everything is made to order . i was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken . friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you re with . my friends and i were on vacation in ny and was referred to chance by a friend . i found the food to be outstanding particulary the salmon dish i had . i also ordered the change mojito which was out of this world . my friends settled for rice dishes but we came back the following day to try the dim sum which was good ... not outstanding but good . we ate out in the back patio which is worth it as it s cool and the music is hear well there . overall excellent restaurant i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family . the food was good . the place was nice and calm . but the service was a bit slow . i work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time . the buffet had a nice selection . the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes . service was also very good . i would go back . i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries . i would recommend roxy s for that but not for their food . my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge but they were too big for the bun . consequently their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ` nt feel like finishing them . also they were $ each i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll . it was $ not really bad for a pound of pastramibut it did n t have much tastei ve had better for less elsewhere this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant the food . the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish . and the tom kha soup was pathetic . if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go . we went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a saturday and i was thoroughly impressed with the food . the pesto pizza was excellent thincrust pizza with a nice amount of spicy italian cheese that i d never heard of before . conveniently located too being right on bedford ave . the back garden sitting area is very pleasant where you can see their personal herb garden . i will definetly be going back . we had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic . my husband said he could ve eaten several more the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had . we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful . i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one . we waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right . we will be back . love the food . it s the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food . it helps if you know what to order . and you ca n t beat the prices . highly recommended . i ve lived in ny for years and this place has it all . great food good size menu great service and an unpretensious setting . the dishes offered were unique very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages sardines with biscuits large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream lrb the best and freshest i ve ever had rrb . i m glad i was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in ny . we have tried every thai restaurant between atlantic avenue and streets and joya is the best . the freshest best variety and the fastest delivery . also very inexpensive . a great choice at any cost and a great deal . the service was excellent and the food was delicious . we are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included ceviche mix lrb special rrb crab dumplings assorted sashimi sushi and rolls two types of sake and the banana tempura . overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites but everything was delicious . definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date . average to good thai food but terrible delivery . i ve waited over one hour for food . they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice . a thai restaurant out of rice during dinner the food arrived minutes after i called cold and soggy . i actually feel like i should keep it a secret . this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money . an excellent service . went to cafe spice with of my friends on a saturday night . we were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial . she was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about indian food . we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry . the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates . we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun lrb dessert rrb recommended by the waiter . i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others . i went here with a friend on a whim we went someplace else first and could n t get a table . service here was great food was fantastic . guacamole shrimp appetizer was really great we both had the filet very good did n t much like the frites that came with but the filet was so good neither of us cared . will absolutely visit again . maybe tomorrow ;rrb . you can not go wrong with this place . the food is outstanding and the service is quick friendly and very professional . always a nice crowd but never loud . go here . good for dates or with friends . i am reluctant to write because i would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded . however it is jus too good to not praise it . by far the best pizza in manhattan . the crust is thin the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly . for all you lazy folks that do n t want to come to alphabet city i say good stay out . less wait time for me we arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly . the menu has so many fish items and oysters . we all ordered different entrees so we could share . the fish was really really fresh . i lived in maine for ten years and grew up on fish . we all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in new york . i stumbled upon this great pizzeria as i explored my new neighborhood . all of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better i highly recommend the sophia pizza . it s to die for the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back . immediately after we paid the waiter took the money and said okay you guys are outta here . there are other people waiting we were n t even at our table for more than an hour total . as we were leaving the couple standing by the door said to another waiter we re not in a hurry . our friends have not arrived yet . so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary for the people who want great food plus great service roxy is a place to avoid i ve been here twice now . the first time the sushi was outstanding the second time it was a little bland . i m sure i ll return for a final judgement tho . the blond wood decor is very soothing the premium sake is excellent and the service is great . mizu is the japenese find in grammercy . while their kitchen food is delicious their sushi is out of this world . mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else . not only is the cuisine the best around the service has always been attentive and charming . warning you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you but the food does n t quite match up . i ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor . the entree was bland and small dessert was not inspired . i expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu . the view is spectacular and the food is great . wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well definitely worth the trip to battery park city one of my favorite places in manhattan . authentic taiwanese food that s cheap ... what more could you ask for lrb besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city rrb . the cold appetizer dishes taste like the way i remember them to taste when i was growing up in taiwan . delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere . kind attentive wait staff . i really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi lrb on saffron risottoyum rrb . my friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos . delicious crab cakes too . even if the food was n t this good the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax . great neighborhood joint . this is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the basil slice . their calzones are horrific bad vomitinducing yuck . they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone . the counter service is bad . they charge different prices all the time . they re rude at times and not very friendly . no pizza for me anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet where greasy dry and tasteless are complimentary . the dosas are skimpy unattractive and drip with grease and personally i d drink popcorn topping before i d eat another one of these . the sandwiches are dry tasteless and way overpriced . calling the place hampton chutney co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too . seriously this place kicks ass . the atmosphere is unheralded the service impecible and the food magnificant . best italian food i ever had lrb and being italian that means alot rrb . it is nearly impossible to get a table so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner do not pass it up . this is such a lovely peaceful place to eat outside . the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty . it is set far from the small street it s on and there is no traffic noise . the food is good especially their more basic dishes and the drinks are delicious . this is a great place to take outoftowners and perfect for watching the sunset . great sushi experience . nice value . unique apppetizers . try sushimi cucumber roll . good spreads great beverage selections and bagels really tasty . the big complaint no toasting available . i complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted . murray wo n t do it . wo n t or ca n t is not in the service directory . but who says murray s is anything about service . so close but not good enough . do n t be fooled by crowds of people . the service is awful . this place is not worth the prices . also do n t plan on asking for your favorite roll if it s not on the menu you ca n t have it . love pizza ... . i will be out with friends and all of a sudden i am hungry and i only crave one thing ... their pizza . i live in the neightborhood and am a regular . it hits the spot every time . this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising . the pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in nyc . even the pasta is delicious here lrb a rarity in new york pizza restaurants rrb . i ve been many time and have never been disappointed . compared to essa tal offers a less doughy bagel they even scoop it out nice lrb for those on a diet rrb not too much not to little . the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee a little crowded but they move that line really fast a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning bagels are ok but be sure not to make any special requests i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere be sure not to get anything other than bagels ... the turkey burgers are scary the worst excuse for japanese food i ve ever encountered . the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water . the sushi was awful the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard . furthermore the rice had no seasoning so the sushi was bland and disgusting . the fish was adequate but inexpertly sliced . it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine . good fast service . i would highly recommend . food is great and inexpensive . the location is perfect . give it a try and enjoy . i thought going to jimmys would give me a real domincan exprience . jimmy is dominican well this place is so ghetto its not even funny . if you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least dollar bottle minimun then you ll love it here . would never go back there . too bad latin quarters closed . that place was awesome sally awsome pizza especially the margheritta slice . always busy but fast moving . great atmoshere and worth every bit . open late lrb well as late as i ever got there and i m a night person rrb . winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you . the food is reliable and the price is moderate . what more can you ask for for authentic thai food look no further than toons . ive been to many thai restaurants in manhattan before and toons is by far the best thai food ive had lrb except for my mom s of course rrb . try the pad thai or sample anything on the appetizer menu ... they re all delicious . everything about this restaurant was special . the service was attentive yet discreet . the flavors robust and subtle . the brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal . i m saving up for my next visit . i went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date . the place was quiet and delightful . service was good and food is wonderful . i did not try the caviar but i tried their salmon and crab salad lrb they are all good rrb . it is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat . as a retired hipster i can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year lucky strike has been the best laidback late night in the city . the wait staff is pleasant fun and for the most part gorgeous lrb in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way not in that she swaycuterthanmethatb@#$* way rrb . the food is yummy especially their cookedtoperfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries . but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere delightfully free of the bts . you can get a completely delish martini in a glass lrb that s about drinks rrb for $ lrb i recommend the vanilla shanty mmmm ... rrb in a great homey setting with great music . the inhouse lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music and moreover takes requests . you ca n t go wrong with this place . suan is a great place that i often take my friends lrb classmates rrb too . its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable makes students go back to suan again and again . i love their thai . noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must i was in love with pongsri on but compared to suan it is slow in service and overpriced . i will go back to suan soon in summereat outside on a terrace lrb another great feature of suan rrb i can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant . i can not imagine better indian food in all of the city . i can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there . this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location . during the course of the past months the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better . i wish they would change back to what it was before . the food now is inconsistent . this is the kind of place you d like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret . the setting is casual and romantic . prices are very good . the food is excellent if you re daring try the balsamic vinegar over icecream it s wonderful do not get the go go hamburgers no matter what the reviews say . they were such a ripoff lrb $ for four small meat patties in steamed buns rrb and not worth trying . the rest of the dim sum though pricey by chinatown standards is worth it . steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table . the wait here is long for dim sum but if you do n t like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig this is a sleek lrb for chinatown rrb alternative . a few tips skip the turnip cake roast pork buns and egg custards . these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner . lrb rrb turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of mott st. just south of bayard . lrb rrb egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of mott street just south of canal . after passing by this restaurant for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner . i was pleasantly suprised . the food was exceptional . the menu consisted of standard brassiere food better then places like balthazar etc. . i choose to go with one of the special the braised lamb shank in red wine which was excellent . the service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual . the restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal . this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices . the pad se ew chicken was delicious however the pad thai was far too oily . i would just ask for no oil next time . have eaten at ginger house several times and it s always good . the fried dumplings are great finally a reliable chinese restaurant this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service . the only thing you can do here is walk in and eat ... but planning an event especially a small intimate one forget about it . they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place but also become hostile nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end not one person takes responsibility for anything . terrible terrible management deserves to be shutdown . never fails to please . delicious bagels especially when right out of the oven . spreads and toppings are great though a bit pricey . service is fast and friendly . only drawback they wo n t toast your bagel and they do n t make eggs for the bagel . but that is highly forgivable . been there done that and new york it s not that big a deal . the food is decent at best and the ambience well it s a matter of opinion some may consider it to be a sweet thing i thought it was just annoying . if celebrities make you sweat then your in for a ride but if your like most around these parts then you ll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype . rao is a good restaurant but it s nothing special . i ve eaten at many different indian restaurants . but after last night spice grill is the only place i m eating indian cuisine . you must try the shrimp appetizers . even my indian friend could n t believe how good and tasty everything was . this place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time . great food great prices great service . if you are looking for a good quality cheap eats this is the place . it s a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food . i really loved the different and inovated touch that s the cheff gives to the food . also it s great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place the service it s just perfect ... they re so frendly that we never want to live the place i love essabagel but i live on the west side so i often go to murray s for convenience . their bagels are fine but they are a little overcooked and not really a ` special bagel experience . better than the bagel shop on the corner but not worth going out of your way for in my opinion . also a little more expensive than your average bagel place . great bagels made the oldfashioned way . the appetizing is excellent just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price lrb if bought by the pound rrb . drawbacks service is slow and they do n t toast the food was absolutely amazing the baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we ve ever had the lamb was tender so full of flavor the dessert was divine the waiter was attentive . the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening . downtown dinner prixe fix appetizers were ok waiter gave me poor suggestion ... try the potato stuff kanish best one . small servings for main entree i had salmon lrb wasnt impressed rrb girlfriend had chicken it was good . dessert is a joke ... dont bother . volare virgins or weekly regulars everyone gets treated the same and you ca n t ask for more than that when the service is this friendly . the restaurant has a family feel not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have singlehandedly solved third world famine . the antipasta was excellent especially the calamari as were the filling pasta mains . the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal . still any quibbles about the bill were offset by the pouryourown measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ... . fantastic place . cute and decorative . a pleasant surprise . go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else . lucky strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat . yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously but it should n t . great food great decor great service . i recommend it just ignore the trendy wannabes . this is the perfect spot for meeting friends having lunch dinner pretheatre or aftertheatre drinks lrb always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer guaranteed to be a tasty experience rrb excellent spot for holiday get togethers with coworkers or friends that you have n t seen in a while . i have been doing all of the above at the heartland brewery for over years now and i have never been disappointed all the people that i bring there go back on their own and bring their friends go there once and oh yes ... you will go back ... you will ... . what a great place not the typical nyc gimmick theme restaurant . a cool bar with great food and tons of excellent beer . and even with it s pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too loved it out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens this is among the best . the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful . it is expensive but well worth the money . if you venture off the island of manhattan and ca n t seem to find a great italian restaurant drive to corona . the only thing more wonderful than the food lrb which is exceptional rrb is the service . the only thing the waiters do n t do for you is wipe your chin when you leave . wonderful at holiday time . cozy romantic atomosphere with only around tables at most . service was very prompt but slightly rushed . food was very good but not what i would consider out of this world . go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience . my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian . too bad the food was n t of the same heritage . the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless so was the seafood tagliatelle . a real dissapointment . but that was n t the icing on the cake a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had . they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chipsgood but a far cry from what the name implies . priced at upper intermediate range . i really liked this place . everything i had was good and i m a eater . it was pretty inexpensive too . this place has the best chinese style bbq ribs in the city . i also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee lrb rice porridge rrb . it s great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend . it s definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone . however if you want great food at a great price and do n t mind the decor you ca n t beat this place . quick and friendly service . this is one of the best comfort food places in the city . it s somewhere you can eat and be happy . when i m feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office i head for cafe st. bart s . when you re sitting in their main dining room lrb which has a spectacular handpainted high ceiling rrb you d never know there was a world outside . the food is wonderful tasty and filling and the service is professional and friendly . i ca n t wait for summer when they serve outside on their gigantic patio . ahhh ... . i recently tried suan and i thought that it was great . this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money . the service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals . i have to say that i am pleasantly suprised and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neighborhood . they all know you . good food . good drink . how do you rate home i have never had cheescake like this . i thought i had died and gone to heaven . great spot whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner . warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months . the food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices . have been several times and it never dissapoints . after hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant and passing by it on a daily basis we decided to try . we were less than impressed . while the ambiance and atmosphere were great the food and service could have been a lot better . we ordered the chicken casserole but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken all dark meat and on the bone . probably would not go again ... . i ve been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine if not good . stick with the chicken beef and lamb dishes . i do n t usually order wine with indian so i ca n t comment on their wine list or their wines . instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian . service is friendly and never had a problem walking in and getting a table . i would recommend reservations on weekends though . skip dessert . best reuben sandwich ever a classic do n t miss bloom s on your next trip to manhatten . it was the first place we ate on our first trip to new york and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to new york . thanks bloom s for a lovely trip . as a fan of thai i have tried quite a few different restaurants in nyc and this one was definitely the worst . the food was not fresh the sauces were bland and very oily . it just was n t thai . went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza lrb as i love la pizza fresca rrb . was surprisingly disappointed . pizza was a little soggy . ravioli was good ... but i have to say that i found everything a bit overpriced . not enough wines by the glass either . service however was excellent ... and i liked the setting/atmosphere a lot . food was just average ... if they lowered the prices just a bit it would be a bigger draw . this place is a great bargain . authentic pakistani food . people are always friendly . do n t waste money on decor . just straight up cheap good food . faan is sooo good . the best pad thai i ve ever had . the design and atmosphere is just as good . bottles of wine are cheap and good . what more could you want the food was actually aweful . i m not picky but it was actually gross . the mussles were the fishiest things i ve ever tasted the seabass was bland the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese the penne w / chicken had bones in it ... it was disgusting . nice atmosphere the service was very pleasant and the desert was good . would n t recomend it for dinner this is the perfect date spot for williamsburg couples . the jukebox plays everything from italian opera to the strokes . the food is amazing rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza . best of all is the warm vibe the owner is super friendly and service is fast . if only they delivered they d make a mint go here for the drinks especially during happy hour enough said the drinks are amazing and half off till . ask for usha the nicest bartender in manhattan . my fav was the sassy lassi ... . this is an amazing place to try some roti rolls . i really recommend the very simple unda lrb egg rrb rolls . delicate spices onions eggs and a kickass roti . amazing toons has recently been redone so it s now a very attractive space . the food s as good as ever . in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food this is one of the best spots . went here last night nice decor good service but the food was surprisingly excellent . the portions are huge so it might be good to order three things to split lrb rather than one appetizer and entree per person rrb for two people . among all of the new avenue restaurants this offers by far one of the best values for your money . ca n t wait to go back . best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town beef noodle soup is good as well . the service is good and the resturant is clean . best taiwanese food in ny i have been to rao s probably times the past years and it keeps getting better . for those that go once and do n t enjoy it all i can say is that they just do n t get it . rao s has the best service and atmosphere in nyc . good luck getting a table . my roommate and i love this place . we recently decided to try this location and to our delight they have outdoor seating perfect since i had my yorkie with me . indoor was very cozy and cute . the portion sizes here are huge and the sushi is good . while it s not nobu it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full . staff is very accomodating . excellent dumplings served amid clean chic decor . i got the $ dim sum combo every bite of which was great . but $ for each small piece not worth it . i wo n t go back unless someone else is footing the bill . i came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend . the decor is very simple but comfortable . the food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach . the portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that . you must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert . the staff there is very attentive and down to earth . i loved it and would go again . great indian food and the service is incredible . the owner truly caters to all your needs . when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets and then ordered for them . everyone was more then happy with his choices . great food and the prices are very reasonable . obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong it actually means great prosperity . the food here does a great service to the name lrb cantonese that is ... rrb . i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork . this dish is my favorite and i always get it when i go there and never get tired of it . try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh a delicious and sweet tasting bread . simply some good tasting chinese food at incredible prices ... . service is not what you are coming here for ... . just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that s all the service i need ... . big wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach . this place ... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend . whoever the jazz duo was they were on point . good music great food speedy service affordable prices . even the wine by the glass was good . its a little out of the way if you do n t live in the neighborhood but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are . consistently good japanese tapas . same owner as the guy who owns typhoon which is just down the street on st. marks and ave. . always good drinks and service is pretty good ; . atmosphere is nice and relaxed too ... . a great place to meet up for some food and drinks ... . yakitori lrb bbq meats rrb is tasty too . it s also attached to angel s share which is a cool more romantic bar ... . just moved to the neighborhood and we ve been trying all the west village sushi restaurants . if you do n t mind presliced low quality fish unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place . price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit . was n t going to share but i feel obligated ... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing . no thanks this place which is only a few months old is perhaps queens biggest secret fabulous decor makes you feel like you re in a trendy manhattan restaurant very very good food cheaplypriced generally friendly staff and if you re a manhattanite or spend most of your time in manhattan rice avenue will make you feel at home ... very soho/village/upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ... all on roosevelt avenue we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date . we were then shooed inside . one would think we d get an apology or complimentary drinks instead we got a snobby waiter would n t even take our order for minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so . we left never to return . with so many good restaurants on the uws i do n t need overpriced food absurdly arrogant waitstaff who do n t recognize they work at a glorified diner clumsy service and management that does n t care . i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bgel on and was disappointed with the service and i thought the food was overated and on the pricey side . if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on street which is blocks away on ave. . great bagels spreads and a good place to hang out in . you fellas above says its the best taiwanese restaurant in town . however it is the only taiwanese restaurant in town . the food is okay and the prices here are mediocre . you ca n t say its cheap because food is cheaper in chinatown . they re are better taiwanese restaurants and they are located in flushing queens . baluchi s has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices . the only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent . he offers subpar service and has no personality . in fact it appears he is going to go postal at any moment . skip this location and go to the one in soho . there is no excuse for such lousy service i have never before eaten pieces of relatively good nigiri . stuffing yourself with japanese food is a rare thing . you can do it here . $ for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten . i went to areo on a sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends and spent three enjoyable hours there . the restaurant was packed at first so we waited at the bar for about minutes before we were seated . most of the servers are very attentive friendly and quite attractive . the atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd but there were a few groups of mid s / year olds also . the vibe is very relaxed and cozy service was great and the food was excellent me and my girls will definitely go back . food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when i went . i would highly recommand requesting a table by the window . although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat . i ve eaten at pizza gruppo a few times but more often i order delivery . the food is great . personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights . i heartily recommend . there is a downside if you re ordering in the delivery guys have major attitude . never have i had such dramatic delivery guys lrb a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c i live in a walkup rrb who always seem disappointed with their tips . hey i think $ for a block walk ai n t bad . love the scene first off the place has a character and nice light to it ... very fortunate location wise . the pizza was pretty good and huge . the price very reasonable . we were and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally . we got most of it back at home with us . i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n t not mention or undermine . the pasta penne was pretty extra buttery creamy which means a big task to diggest ... tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and to count penne ... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed ... lol . no really . i have eaten a lot of pizza here . la rosa waltzes in and i think they are doing it the best . interesting selection good wines service fine fun decor . i have been twice to this restaurant . i love it . i plan on stopping by next week as well . i found it on a cold night the perfect spot to warm up . i recieved prompt service with a smile . to me it exemplifies soho cute artsy interesting . definately check it out this place blew me away ... by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side . the wine list is extensive and impressive . love the atmosphere felt like i was in paris . the mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert ... definitely going to be back very soon . i just read mocaramel s review and felt compelled to respond . i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna . over the years the host vittorio and his crew have always treated me as family although with all the business this notsolittle gem does it amazing he s even able to remember a consistent but notsofrequent visitor . i ve also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years a new jazz bar the most fantastic dining garden the best thin crust pizzas and now a lasagna menu which is to die for lrb these are not your average lasagnas rrb i love this place keep up the good work guys my girlfiends and i ate at o.g. again last night . i have to say i have never had a disapointing meal here . we could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu . luckily we saved room for the bbq salmon sea bass and crispy duck . we got a little tipsy from the sake but is n t that what saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about love al di la . i recommend this place to everyone . great food . one of my favorite places in brooklyn . the pastas are incredible the risottos lrb particularly the sepia rrb are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing . overpriced and not tasty . the food here was mediocre at best . it was totally overpriced fish and chips was about $ ... . there are so many other great places to go to eat and drink ... this place is not worth it ... . tasty dog an awesome organic dog and a conscious eco friendly establishment . one of the best hot dogs i have ever eaten . ca n t wait to go back . the cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it . but the best pork souvlaki i ever had is the main thing . trust me . run do n t walk . super yummy pizza i was visiting new york city with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant . i looove their eggplant pizza as well as their pastas we had half/half pizza mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza we had fun eating in there we were there like around a.m. in the morning will comeback for sure wish they have it here in la. . excellent food although the interior could use some help . the space kind of feels like an alice in wonderland setting without it trying to be that . i paid just about $ for a good meal though rrb . great sake reliable fresh sushi . my husband and i take out from here times a month . the sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious . have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once . delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week . delivery guy sometimes get upset if you do n t tip more than . we ve found it to be better and fresher than kiku which is comparable in price . best ... sushi ... ever . this place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi . creative consistent fresh . excellent sashimi and the millennium roll is beyond delicious . not cheap but very yummy . love it . very very nice . the place is a bit hidden away but once you get there it s all worth it . not only is the food . loved it . my wife and i went to water s edge for a romantic dinner . we had a very nice time . the waiter was attentive the food was delicious and the views of the city were great . i d definitely go back again . great place to relax and enjoy your dinner . there is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week . place is open till late no dress code . good food my favorite is the seafood spaghetti . highly recommended excellent food for great prices . my husband and i have been sold on this from the first visit . the wait staff is very courteous and accomodating . the space is limited so be prepared to wait up to minutes hour but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indochinese food . there are no negatives to speak of . the bestt my favorite place lol . i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good . its alright . im not necessarily fanatical about this place but it was a fun time for low pirces . lobster was good nothing spectacular . its just a fun place to go not a five star restaraunt . way below average . i think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked . had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive . would never go back . i love this place . i was n t here for the pizza so i ca n t comment on that yet but what i had was very good . the service was quick and friendly . everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome . i thought the restaurant was nice and clean . i ordered the vitello alla marsala and i was pretty impressed . the veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly . the potato balls were not dry at all ... in fact it was buttery . the only downside ... they only take cash which is ok if you know about it ahead of time . i ll be back for sure . worst place on smith street in brooklyn . very immature bartender didnt know how to make specific drinks service was so slowwwww the food was not fresh or warm waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers . i would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner . awesome . the food is always fresh ... . overpriced japanese food with mediocre service . went here on sat and was disappointed . chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top food was luke warm . the waitress was not attentive at all . i was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have . too many other good places to have to settle . not because you are `` the four seasons ... you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner . the food was excellent as well as service however i left the four seasons very dissappointed . i do not think dinner in manhattan should cost $ where i am not swept off my feet . red dragon roll my favorite thing to eat of any food group hands down . just go to yamato and order the red dragon roll . if you do n t like it i do n t know what to tell you . the seafood dynamite is also otherworldly . i m not even going to bother to describe it ; it speaks for itself . favorite sushi in nyc . i have eaten at some of the ` best sushi joints in nyc lrb nobu bond street jewelbako etc rrb and yamato is my favorite . an unpretentious spot in park slope the sushi is consistently good the service is pleasant effective and unassuming . in the summer months the back garden area is really nice . the rolls are creative and i have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food . the dancing white river and millenium rolls are musts . so good . i can eat here every day of the week really lol love this place ... rrb . gross food wow . i ca n t remember the last time i had such gross food in new york . my quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a threeyear old with no sense of proportion or flavor . and $ for a plate of bland guacamole come on . do n t get me started on the margaritas either . mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila . really i find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds this in the city of a million restaurants at least of which are way better than this one . save your money and your time and go somewhere else . oh and i never write reviews i just was so moved by how bad this place was i felt it was my duty to spread the word . great indian food this place was reccomended to me by a friend . when i got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly . the food was good the place was clean and affordable . i noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place this is one of my favorite spot very relaxing the food is great all the times celebrated my engagement and my wedding here it was very well organized . the staff is very good . love their drink menu . i highly recommend this beautiful place . nice for one time special occasion . went for mom s birthday brunch/lunch . they honored reservation on sunday afternoon very well . be aware . we were offered water for the table but were not told the voss bottles of water were $ a piece . food was ok . nice view of river and nyc . i come here enjoy very much with husband . remind me of home . great survice . mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm so delicious . a beautifully designed dreamy egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night . watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that s more lemony than smoky . oh and there s hookah . raymond the bartender rocks pacifico is a great place to casually hang out . the drinks are great especially when made by raymond . the omlette for brunch is great ... . the spinach is fresh definately not frozen ... . quacamole at pacifico is yummy as are the wings with chimmichuri . a weakness is the chicken in the salads . it s just average just shredded no seasoning on it . also i personally was n t a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole . overall decent food at a good price with friendly people . best indian restaurant in the city . decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york . small bright and clean bz grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints both in astoria and out . what really makes it shine is the food which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices and all made inhouse lrb even the gyro meat and sausages rrb and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected . all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent but the gyro is the reason to come if you do n t eat one your trip was wasted . best restaurant in brooklyn . the best great food amazing service this place is a class act . the veal was incredible last night . fresh mind blowing flavors . this place is a must visit you want to have a real hot dog in brooklyn skip nathan s ... you can get that at the mall ... go to bark . delicious creative and fun . got a date ... go here every time i have a special occasion with my boyfriend i have a hard time going anywhere else . it is so romantic . its dark and cozy ... there is always jazz music playing when we go . most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like ` that couple . the food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together . i ve enjoyed of the dishes we ve ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional tooauthenticforme dish lrb i m a daring eater but not that daring rrb . once you try it for a special occasion beware ... you ca n t stop you ll be ther for every anniversary birthday valentines day ... . for a fabulous wedding my daughter s wedding reception at water s edge received the highest compliments from our guests . everyone raved about the atmosphere lrb elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views rrb and the fabulous food service was wonderful ; . everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful . paul the maitre d was totally professional and always on top of things . thank you everyone at water s edge . ruth mother of the bride . would not go back . service ok but unfriendly filthy bathroom . the high prices you re going to pay is for the view not for the food . the bar drinks were eh ok to say the least . the stuff tilapia was horrid ... tasted like cardboard . we thought the dessert would be better wrong $ down the toilet ... . oh speaking of bathroom the mens bathroom was disgusting . the floor was wet the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor no soap and no hand towels left . go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead . good experience . during our trip to nyc we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the four seasons for their pretheater menu lrb offering a modified menu for $ pp rrb . the wine list was extensive though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings . the bread we received was horrible rock hard and cold and the `` free appetizer of olives was disappointing . however our main course was wonderful . i had fish and my husband had the filet both of which exceeded our expectations . the dessert lrb we had a pear torte rrb was good but once again the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions . when we inquired about ports the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost . not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this location . all in all i would return as it was a beautiful restaurant but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future . short and sweet seating is great it s romantic cozy and private . the boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they re perfect for people . the service was extremely fast and attentive lrb thanks to the service button on your table rrb but i barely understood word when the waiter took our order . the food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy . over . over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals . so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food . will probably not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once . impressed ... . subtle food and service . noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food i enjoy . servers are all different greg is my favorite . sometimes tables do n t understand his sense of humor but it s refreshing to have a server who has personality professionalism and respects the privacy of your dinner . this is the first place i ve been that a runner remembers my order ... hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant . prices are fair across the board for both food and bev . i go out to eat and like my courses servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink . restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place . amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings this place had all the trimmings and i mean all . peppers onions relish chilli cheeses you name it . amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place out best dining experience in the west village stepping into casa la femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in new york highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night i had the have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for food took some time to prepare all worth waiting for . we were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd . i never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending great find in the west village maggot in the food i ve been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table . the menu looked great and the waiter was very nice but when the food came it was average . nevertheless i finished my plate and that s when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom . i showed it to the manager and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts lrb but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for rrb . when the bill came nothing was comped so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine but i did n t think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it . yes i ate the food but i certainly would not have if i had seen the maggot before eating and i was at this point fairly sick to my stomach . the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine lrb which cost less than the food rrb and made it seem like a big concession . we paid and left because we did n t feel like arguing any more . i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food . for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service . a fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes flatbush farm is n t in the same league as the blue hills or even the farm on adderlys of the world but it s pretty good albeit with a somewhat dismal setting . unhygienic . i do not recommend . i went there . i got hair in my food times of then great place great value . the food is flavorful plentiful and reasonably priced . the atmosphere is relaxed and casual . it s a great place to order from or sitin . awesome . inexpensive unassuming great time sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance . try it very pleased . good creative rolls yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much . they have great rolls the triple color and norwegetan rolls are awesome and filling . one special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up but save room for dessert they have a delicious banana chocolate dessert as well as a great green tea tempura . the appetizers are also delicious amazing food . mazing interior . great food i ve had my fair share of modern japanese and this spot delivers . the atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors . if you re into being lost when you re just five feet from your table then hey that s a good thing . despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my goto for modern japanese food for the foreseeable future . another review here claimed the prefix was $ person including sake but it is $ per person not including sake . indo chinese food pretty good ... . not a very fancy place but very good chinese style indian food . the chicken lollipop is my favorite most of the dishes lrb i have to agree with a previous reviewer rrb are quite oily and very spicy espeically the chilli chicken . my mom originally introduced me to this place but even she lrb being indian rrb feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily . still we keep going back rrb . i was speechless by the horrible food . i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant and the food was majorly disappointing . rather than eating the meat entree being offered i requested a vegetarian dish . rather than preparing vegetarian dish the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables lrb minus sauce seasoning or any form or aesthetic presentation rrb . i was so stunned and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing . this place survives on reputation alone . i will never return . best in all of nyc . this is the most wonderful restaurant in all of new york city not just brooklyn ... . for years they have put out the most tasty most delicious food and kept it that way ... . never swaying never a bad meal never bad service ... . i m telling you ... . you should travel from the bronx to try it ... . great food great wine list great service in a great neighborhood ... . so delicious patsy s pizza = true love . hands down the best pizza on the planet . my bf and i go to the walkup counter and order a pie . in about minutes the thing is gone . need i say more great hot dogs ... . the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside . great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost great taste . great original taste . for me dishes a little oily but overall dining experience good . helpful service and average price per dish $ . the only thing that strikes you is the decor lrb not very pleasant rrb . great food . this place has great indian chinese food . the flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal . be prepared to wait because the place is pretty tiny . also they do not take credit card so come with cash even though the place is not beautiful the food speaks for itself . best indian chinese in the city by far amazing my favorite i have been living in nyc for bit now and i have to say i love to go out and explore the scene . i came across village underground by accident now i go there all the time . the martinis are amazing and very fairly priced . the service is amazing i ve had different waiters and they were all nice which is a rare thing in nyc . the dj is awesome i have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and i keep going back . you can get a table without a reservation if you get there early i they do n t make you by bottles . which lets face it ... at times it s a good thing . in the end you end up with a fair tab and nothing but a great time highly recommended one of the best if not the best restaurants in park slope lrb and ny in general rrb . everything on the menu is great . this establishment is the real deal . wish ny had more of these kind of places intimate superb food homey top notch all the way around certainly worth the wait . there is `` expensivebutworthit and there is `` expensiveandwtf this is a twentysomething guy that does n t mind laying down $ for a fine and delicious meal for on special occassions . but $ for a dinner for two that did n t include wine are you freaking kidding me look the appetizers were really good . the entree was also very good . ca n t argue about that but they are clearly over priced . what you are paying for is the environment and the name . yes the place is classy and beautiful but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while . $ included . drinks glasses of dom perignon at $ each . starters kobe beef sashimi . which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef . surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe . a beef consomme . entrees vanison steak and bison steak . vanison was good but not amazing . bison was quite excellent however . dessert pure disaster . just not good at all . some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all . i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself but may be it is worth it . i was wrong . the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants but trust me they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say `` i ve been to the four seasons restaurant . i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it . all in all the food was great lrb except for the dessserts rrb . the environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts . if you are going for the food it will not be worth it . yes it is good but i ve had better for cheaper . you would think they would make up for it with service sadly no . service was just ok it is not what you d expect for $ . terrible waste of money ... scammers . i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience but not in a good way . i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience . i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time . we went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different . our visit their to say the least was an unpleasant and costly experience and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience . we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table . although we were told minutes and it was more like minutes . we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited . the place is beautiful the hostess was very pleasant . however our $ drinks were were horrible once we finally got a table despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed since we were already waiting so long we felt we had no other choice but to accept it . our experience did not ever get any better . for each course we waited over hour to minutes and were never offered a drink . we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka . after the time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner . we asked for beverages and never received them . we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order . my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin . i would not expect this for a $ dinner . by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka what we did do was waste hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka ... some of which we never received the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses to top it all off ... the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant . by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused and wasted my hard earned money . my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly i wish i could be refunded do n t go with a larger group than i went here for a family birthday dinner . five of us walked in at approximately on a thursday evening . the hostess said `` wow that s a large group unless you are n t together to which i replied `` no we are and there will be one more so a table for six please . at first we were a little taken aback as this seemed to present a problem although the restaurant looked fairly empty but they hastily put the table together for us . the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions . there was no tap beer that evening which was a disappointment . not much of a selection of bottled beer either we went with brahma . the appetizers we ordered were served quickly an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion lrb maybe of each rrb . the lobster knuckles lrb special of the day rrb were ok but pretty tasteless . i believe there were shrimp in the `` salt encrusted shrimp appetizer . after we ate our appetizers lrb which took all of minutes rrb we ordered another round of brahma s and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member . the waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order . we replied that we would like to wait more minutes if that was okay . she replied `` well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now since you are a larger party and it might get crowded . we called the other person who was very close by and she told us to order for her so we did . the food arrived in about minutes . i had the thai style fried sea bass ... which was very good . everyone seemed generally happy with their food except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice i heard the lobster roll was excellent . they seemed to continue to rush us along taking plates without asking if we were done lrb my sister still had her fork in hand rrb . all in all the food was good a little on the expensive side but fresh . service not the friendliest to our `` large party probably would not go back here . great indian food . i lived on st and wanted indian one day so decided to check this place out . food was amazing i love indian food and eat it quite regularly but i can say this is one of the best i ve had . very `` normal indian food but done really well . i have it a instead of because of the price lrb just chicken tikka masala no bread of rice is $ rrb which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place does n t have an upscale feel . also waiters try to push more food on you like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ . i do n t appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron s knowledge so that was a huge turnoff lrb more than the price rrb . but if you re prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary then this is the place to go for indian food . one of the best . bukhara grill the tagline says it all ... `` indian spice rave . my gf and i dine at bukhara often as she lives near it . the lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it . we go often for lunch and the place is packed . we have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given . bukhara is on my top indian places in nyc . wretched and retching . this will be only the third online review i have ever made about a restaurant in my life . they have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant . i have never been so disgusted by both food an service . for starters they delivered us someone else s order . fine i wont hang you for that . however once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair lrb sometimes you have to settle when it s your only option rrb i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting slimy clearly bad piece of fish skin . not one to jump to complaints lrb hence my lack of previous online reviewing rrb i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations . my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation . none was made so i hung up . less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet . my girlfriend being slightly more aggressive and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant . not only have i worked in restaurants for many years i am now in culinary school i am a huge lover of oysters and fish and my girlfriend is half korean we know the difference between and oyster and bad fish . it was n t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand but now it s simply repulsive . eat at your own risk . gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner . i took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night . i book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot . the service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing i completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date . more williamsburg garbage . my wife and i visited dokebi tonight . we ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgibokum . the dishes came out around minutes apart . the bibimbap was average but the stone bowl was n t even close to sizzling . too bad i had paid an extra $ for the stone bowl . the nakgibokum was horrible . easily the worst stirfried squid i ve ever tasted . the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean . the side dishes were passable and i did get a refill upon request . the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service . i mentioned the squid dish was n t very good when the waitress visited . she just nodded and walked off . there were no communications issues either as she spoke perfect english . as to my comment about the food no apology or acknowledgment was made . my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish . we were charged full price . if you ware looking for korean fusion i suggest you try some of the places in the east village . authentic korean food lovers should visit street of course . lives up to the hype . we ve lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there . we ve tried before but it always packed and does n t take reservations . it was well worth the wait . the wife had the risotto which was amazing . it does n t look appetizing as it s covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black but the taste was phenomenal . the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty . i love margherita pizza i looove east village pizza . love this place every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go . a quintessential slice of nyc pizza . the crust has a great bite and a good chew the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it the salt from the cheese is great really heightens the flavor of all the other components . personally i like the margherita pizza better but they are all good . possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city . this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie lrb that do n t serve sushi rrb and in my opinion one of the most romantic restaurants in the city not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot once you enter the unmarked wooden doors the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you re no longer in the city . if you re planning to come here make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching lrb choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky rrb it s just you and your date and an occasional cute ` excuse me before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth my party had the bbe $ fixe prix menu which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it . we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche . our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce . i picked the grilled black cod as my entree which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better . the entrees were served with miso soup and rice . the sake s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world . for desserts we tried the frozen black sesame mousse lrb interesting but not extraordinary rrb and matcha lrb powdered green tea rrb and blueberry cheesecake which was phenomenal . maybe it was the great company lrb i had friends visiting from philly yes it was not a date this time rrb or the super reasonable price point but i just ca n t say enough good things about this brasserie . i do n t usually visit the same establishment more than once what more twice but i ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet unhurried and memorable dinner . terrible would be a compliment the service leaves much to be desired from feeling like you are rushed the place your order to being ignored the rest of the night . we were people celebrtating a birthday we sat in the tent . we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing we never ate because by close to in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating . they are extremely rude not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ for some drinks adn their pita bread stay away . great shabu shabu . i go here at least once every other week particularly when it s cold i love it . to be honest we only ever eat the shabu shabu . i tried a couple other dishes but was n t too impressed . but for the shabu shabu you wo n t find much better in ny . in fact there is only one i ve tried that even compares lrb shabu tatsu rrb and even then i prefer dokebi . the meat is fresh the sauces are great you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too . dokebi gives williamsburg the right onetwo punch of classic korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos . the hot dogs are good yes but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich perfect on its supermarket squishy bun . restaurant with a view . celebrated my fathers birthday here . the food tasted very good . the family seafood entree was very good . the main entree was also very good . we order a bit of everything on the menu . price is high but the food is good so i would come back again . this place does n t make any sense . just want to warn you all do n t waste your time and money . this place has totally weird decor stairs going up with mirrored walls i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ... . this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird . the concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n t work . the food they serve is not comforting not appetizing and uncooked . go to japanese sushi place or spanish tapas place this creation in williamsburg is a misstake . good food . i went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary . the food was great and tasty but the sitting space was too small i do n t like being cramp in a corner . over all it was a very nice romantic place . i would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation lrb if possible rrb . loved it . a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it . the atmosphere was great . the food we ordered was excellent although i would n t say the margaritas were anything to write home about . our waitress was n t mean but not especially warm or attentive either . i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year though . maybe it has improved since then regardless we ll be back and ca n t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio . dumbfoundingly poor . this was from start to finish a mindbogglingly uncomfortable experience . lexicographers take note a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn . the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention . polite acknowledgement is out ; . supercilious scorn is in . and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent a different server enhanced the fun dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer lrb which was delicious rrb . overall the food quality was pretty good though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n t sat cooling in front of the guest . the place has a nice fitout some attractive furnishings and from what i could tell a reasonable wine list lrb i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins rrb . at $ for two people however this in no way represents value unless you re looking to pay by the hour for passiveaggressive torture . on that scale it s a worldbeater . how is this palce still open i honestly do n t even know where to begin . my boyfriend and i are avid restaurant goers and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flatbush farms . we arrived and were seated immediately which made us both happy . we ordered our appetizers i ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon . everything was going good until we got our meals . i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled . it was served with skin over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes . my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead while he deskinned the chicken so that i could enjoy the white meat . i took one bite from the $ salmon and i have never in the years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy as dry and as bland as the one in flatbush farms . at this point the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n t say anything and guess what the waitress walked away . so i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it . i could n t even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . i ve had better chicken at bbqs so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible . guess what i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did she says `` oh well i wish you would have said something earlier no apology nothing . after that she simply took our plates walked away came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it no desert menu no apology nothing i was literally going to explode but instead my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager . this is where it really really gets bad the manager said there is absolutely nothing we can do it s a matter of taste that she did n t like it and i can not comp it . again no apology no is there anything else i can get you no can i get you a drink to make up for it nothing we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore . the level of rudeness was preposterous . the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want so we paid for what we did enjoy the drinks and appetizers and walked out . i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience . this staff should be fired . cirspy crust margherita pizza . we have been there times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes . it was really good pizza . the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded rrb rrb rrb . you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review . single worst restaurant in manhattan . i ll being with a couple of positives cool decor good pita and hummus and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty . moving on . if i could give stars i would do so for this place . casa la femme is to middle eastern dining what chuckie cheeze is to italian . the reason there are different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews . well ... they can run but they ca n t hide . i live in the west village and i ve been to a lot of restaurants . sometimes you pay a lot and do n t get much in return it s manhattan things are expensive . however most of them are at least prompt and pleasant . this place ... god where do i begin . it is quite a spectacular scene i ll give them that . the decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n t notice that you just payed bucks for some cold eggplant that took frickin hours to come how this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy or any other for that matter is beyond me . great hot dogs i ve made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby lrb i live on uws rrb . though it s been crowded most times i ve gone here bark always delivers on their food . the hot dogs are top notch and they re slamwich is amazing going to bark is always worth the train ride and will make your tongue and belly very happy only complaint is the pricing i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu . but nonetheless great spot great food . fabulous food if the front of house staff do n t put you off . we live nearby bfc . it s a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions but we ve eaten there times in the last years . each time we ve been the front of house staff lrb not the waiters they re fantastic but the people who greet and seat you rrb has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return . as bfc does n t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated which can be over an hour later the frizzy retro girl lrb with winged / dame edna glasses rrb will yell at you if you try to order a drink . i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at on a friday night because she `` had a bbq to go to that night wtf i d be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely there s another girl who i ca n t describe she is about with brown hair who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in except she only hears the last part of what you said so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you re * really * talking about . i m a friendly person so i would n t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal . again i d be super upset if that were my employee . considering you will spend at least $ a head i expect better service . so if you re walking by and thinking about dining you might want to see who s going to be seating you first ... . maitred `` eat and get out . my family ate here last weekend . the food and service were fine however the maitred was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant . while finishing our meals which included a highend bottle of wine our son s fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert . this guy refused to seat her and she left followed shortly by the four of us but not before i told him that in my years of world travel including paris that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant . his response was smug arrogant and condescending totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening . a word to the wise you ca n t dine here and disturb the maitred s sense of table turnover as whacked as it is or else . if you go here do it on his offnight . best meal in a long time mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening . i had the lamb special which was perfect . my father had the flank steak which was very good and my mother had the swordfish . the four seasons restaurant is a great experience . the food is great and the environment is even better . everyone must come here at least once . highly recommend it taking hot dogs to the next level . at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint but at bark you do n t just get your average hot dog . here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available . great atmosphere . went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal . i highly recommend the fish tacos everything else was ok . cool atmosphere the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night . poor service and management . do n t go to this place had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner . appetizers took nearly an hour . when the main course finally arrived lrb another rrb half of our order was missing . never got an explanation as to what was going on . the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly . when we threatened to leave we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing . on the way out we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues . ca n t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients . what a hassle the food is very good but not outstanding . there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table . on our last visit they skipped over our name on the list leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table . mistakes happen but they are usually accompanied by an apology perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff . without the wait or attitude i would probably go back but there are just too many other restaurants in brooklyn that are as good or better and do n t make me jump through hoops . expensive . i went there after hearing how great it was . wow . the bread was stale the salad was overpriced and empty . the pasta was well cooked did n t have enough sauce though or flavor . i though it was expensive and i prefer bella via just blocks away by far . so rude i went with jwils . her review is above . i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience . my friend is right in the experience we had . the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us . the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared . i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane . i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said `` can i help you and `` how many are in your party . what the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were . we did n t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem . shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and nonexistent customer service . bad staff . i generally like this place . the food is good . the design of the space is good . but the service is horrid i was there for brunch recently and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter . the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand . i ca n t believe that it was but please put the bag down before delivering food the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating lrb a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere so i try to ignore it rrb . i could n t ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends who was in mid bite to clear the table . she then put the check down without asking if we were done and came to check on the bill every two minutes even though we were one of three occupied tables . i wish i could like this place more and i wish someone would retrain the staff . yum serves really good sushi . not the biggest portions but adequate . green tea creme brulee is a must do n t leave the restaurant without it . no comparison . i ca n t say enough about this place . it has great sushi and even better service . the entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need . i ve been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date . snotty attitude . we were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast . the owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint . good food we love breakfast food . this is a great place to get a delicious meal . we never had to wait more than minutes . the staff is pretty friendly . the onion rings are great they are not greasy or anything . overrated . i was highly disappointed in the food at pagoda . the lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns the few they actually give you ... were not good . the prices are outrageous especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood chinese establishments . nice ambience but highly overrated place . i will not go back . worst service i ever had . a group of of us went there for sunday brunch and sat outside . everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received . our waiter was nonexistent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered we were not given any water or utensils . i complained to the manager but he was not even apologetic . i will never return again . fabulous italian food i highly recommend mioposto . i am so happy to have a wonderful italian restaurant in my neighborhood . the wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to italy . i love this restaurant . i will never forget the amazing meal service and ambiance i experience at this restaurant . it was absolutely amazing . the wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice good at their jobs and cultured . i have not a bad thing to say about this place . amazing . i can not wait to go back again this coming weekend mmm ... good went there last night with a friend . she had heard from a coworker about this place . the food was great it s * very * reasonably priced esp for the quality of the food . i had the kafta plate and it was perfect . we re going back d . finally a meal that you will remember for a long time in a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants its nice to see a place that bucks that trend and just plain delivers high quality food and good service period . this is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer . caution its real food for people who love the best . some of the food is clearly oriented toward foodies lrb like me rrb so if your not a foodie lrb nothing wrong with that rrb head over to mcdonalds or some ruby tuesday and have at it if your looking for real quality lrb not the bs that is seen on yelp ratings which allegedly recently got in trouble for `` adjusting ratings rrb you need to get in here very disappointing . i took my parents here for their anniversaryvery very disappointed i liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price . i may not be a sushi guru but i can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it . rice is too dry tuna was n t so fresh either . nothing really came across as outstanding . very disappointed . i have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent . however the value and service are both severely lacking . portions contain less fish than one would expect particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in nyc lrb masa excluded of course rrb . furthermore while the fish is unquestionably fresh rolls tend to be inexplicably bland . the service ranges from mediocre to offensive . on a recent trip our waiter was extremely dismissive while no less than three staff members waited handandfoot on a pair of japanese girls seated nearby . we were then charged for their most expensive sake lrb $ per serving rrb when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price . but im sure this was just an honest mistake ... . freshest sushi i love this restaurant . they pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls . the sashimi was the freshest and most tender i have ever tasted . their apps are all delicious . the only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side . but the space is small and lovely and the service is helpful . you are bound to have a very charming time . not recommanded the food was not great & the waiters were rude . it is not worth going at all and spend your money there great service . pretty cheap for sit down mexican and downtown . my service was stellar the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me . food was fine with a some littletastierthannormal salsa . if you re in the area you should n t be disappointed . ok ... maybe i went in on someone s bad day ... . the food was great the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me . took forever to get our order taken water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention . i do n t know if i ll be back ... . mama mia i live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place . the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it s edible even when you order ahead . but once done it s not too much dough not too much cheese not too much sauce . best sushi in town . have gone to all the top places . everything you want and more very fresh . its worth the wait especially since they ll give you a call when the table is ready . the best calamari in seattle ... and the best summertime deck experience they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the seattle evening weather . a perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year . endless fun awesome music great staff by far the best bar in the east village ... . i went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast every time `` is called the bartender buys everyone drinks been there lots since and its always a good time . great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks . definitely has one of the best jukebox s i ve seen in a long long time . i found a new home on second avenue where can i begin . i ca n t just go there and see for yourself . the food is great the bartenders go that extra mile . you need to watch your game they will have it on for you . the owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for . and the upstairs is a great place to hang out . not alot of smoking places left in new york but i have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city . kudos to these guys . i found a new home and just moved with a long lease . thank you . go beyond the california rolls ... . the sushi here is delicious they have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from ; atlantic or pacific . i ve had the jellyfish horse mackerel blue fin tuna and the sake ikura roll among others and they were all good . my only negative comment is that i wish the pieces were a little bigger . the decor is rustic traditional japanese . the crowd is mixed yuppies young and old . the service was courteous and attentive . mediocre food . we ate on the outside patio area for dinner on a saturday night . the outside patio area has an abbreviated menu . we ordered the marinated grapes buffalo style chicken wings and the turkey sandwich . my g/f and i both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price . we are locals and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably onetime customer tourists . service was decent . drinks were good . unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks i would n t recommend going here . you are likely to be disappointed . excellent food nice ambience fairly expensive . i loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi lrb big ones to a plate instead of or so little gnocchis rrb and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes . the ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in downtown disney . it was romantic and even nice even with my sister reminded me of italy and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a mediterrean villa . i recommend it for a night when you want to splurge lrb it was a bit expensive rrb best indian food in l.a. . i ve been to over a dozen indian places in l.a. and this is still my favorite . the best thing is the prices are also quite reasonable . the chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes . the chana masala lrb garbanzo beans rrb are also excellent . it s located in a strip mall near the beverly center not the greatest location but the food keeps me coming back for more . hidden little jem . tucked away over by the beverly center . never too crowded and always great service . i think i have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent . i can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma . you routinely see indian families and friends dining there which is always a good sign . i appreciate their delivery too . nice food but no spice i really enjoyed my meal here . i had yummy lamb korma saag paneer samosas naan etc. . the food was all good but it was way too mild . normally places ask how hot you want it but they did n t . i should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild . i will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches . the naan was some of the best i ve had and i really enjoyed the bhartha not too tomatoey . even the chickpeas which i normally find too dry were good . and they packaged everything nicely so it did n t spill . awesome find . i do n t understand how i was a stranger to this place for so long ... the fajita salad the colorado the fajitas everything is delicious . i love the warm & cosy environment . i just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party ca n t wait to celebrate my next birthday there . best restaurant in the world great decor great customer service friendly manager . first of all henrymillionare you dont know a thing about middle eastern food so dont talk . cry me a river stop complaining you obviously you have no taste in food . i am never disappointed with there food . the atmosphere is great . and all you other people that have a problem get some help . great lunch spot . great financial district mexican spot . always busy but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service . everything i ve had here is good taco salads burritos enchiladas i love this place . also have great margaritas you can order to go if you have to get back to the office too lebanese food yum i ve been to open sesame only once but i m still reeling from the experience the food is simply unforgettable i had the beef kabobs with a side of cucumber yogurt . the presentation of the food was an added bonus it looked just as great as it tasted my best friend had the chicken shawarma and she still raves about it being the best anywhere her sister had the baklava for dessert what a tastly flaky treat the staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful . go to open sesame holy hummus the food is here is incredible though the quality is inconsistent during lunch . dinners have always been excellent in terms of food quality . the open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given . the side of potatoes is to die for as is the labne lrb yogurt dip rrb . also they serve the best hummus in america with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil lrb which i believe is the traditional way rrb the only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service . there have been several occasions when we ve just not gotten some side dishes we ve ordered . however this place is a gem and i wo n t stop going back . great beer . my first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible we waited over minutes for our drinks and over hours for our food . i swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal . however one sunday afternoon my husband and i did go lrb although with my loud protests rrb and were pleasantly surprised . the band was very good and the service was attentive . outside in the area between the restaurant and the park children were running around while their parents sipped wine . we ordered a selection of the small plates and the shoe string onions goat cheese pizza grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good . it was like dining at a completely different restaurant . we have since returned and also had a great experience sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer lrb cold and good rrb . we did have the same waiter the second time so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good . sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun . seattle s best winelist . ray s lrb suprisingly rrb has the city s best & most diverse wine list . the sommelier is fantastic downtoearth & extremely knowlegable . i would go back for the wine experience alone . nice job not the place it once was . it is sad to see a place that was once `` the place to meet and eat for bfast or lunch now be the place that is a big `` dont bother . the food is not what it once was lrb potions have seriously seen downsizing rrb prices have gone up and the service is the worst i have experienced anywhere lrb including mainland europe rrb . what may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment . this establishment really made a marked decline after lrb and this is recurring story rrb the airing of food televisions `` diners driveins and dives hosted by guy fieri in which schooner or later was subject of . perhaps now scooner or later falls into the `` dive category . this is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat . i hope one day scooner or later returns to what it once was . untill this happens my advice is to stay away . open & cool place with the best pizza and coffee . mioposto has a very creative & delicious pizza menu . the coffe is very good too . great open and friendly ambience . this place is charming and relaxing . the servers behind the counter are always friendly and helpful . it reminds me of those great little restaurants in san francisco . it s a great place to enjoy food and meet friends . old reliable . after years in seattle ray s rates as the place we always go back to . great food spectacular location and friendly service keep us coming back year after year . enjoyed the food . first of all i am not from long beach . i was visiting socal a couple of months ago when the friend i was visiting decided to take me to this restaurant . lrb she was actually going to take me to another mediterranean restaurant right across the street but they were not open yet even though it was a few minutes past their opening time . rrb i liked it . food was good and cheap . i had the kafta plate and i enjoyed it . it was so much though that i could barely finish but i did since it was delicious . atmosphere was nice . service was kind of slow our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it was n t that busy . still i would recommend this place . btw i really like long beach . it was one of the few places in socal where you would actually walk around and not have to take a car . wow it cant get any better what else can you say nice people amazing food wow . great food with an awesome atmosphere eggs pancakes potatoes fresh fruit and yogurt everything they serve is delicious . the best place for a leisure sunday breakfast amidst yachts then take a stroll through the nearby farmer s market . great meal the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi this fish was perfect plus i am allergic to rice and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating did n t even bat an eye and the waiter suggested a perfect sake absolutely fabulous unbeatable sushi two thumbs up i love sushi and i have eaten it all over the world . this is right up there with places in tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned . melt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi and very tasty rolls too . be sure to try the oyster roll . splendid . how to describe the best sushi in nyc hmmmm delicious amazing fantastic suculent perfect nah all of the above . i ca n t saybenough good things about this restaurant and i ca n t wait for my next several visits . the best chuwam mushi i have ever had . perfect on a cold day . $ with tip . perfection . good sushi high price . one of the best sushi place in town . the house special roll is really good . on weekends you might have to wait for couple hours . however they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone . a cozy spot for . i ca n t believe murphy s has been around for over years amazing . that s a huge compliment especially in the fickled restaurant business ... enough already brunch at murphy s is to die for my specialty ... egg white omelet the food is always freshly prepared . it s the perfect spot for a romantic date for or a secret rendezvous save room for scrumptious desserts . the restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you wo n t forget i guarantee you wo n t be disappointed there s also valet parking . addicting best mexican place for lunch in the financial district . love the enchiladas and chicken soup and be sure to check out their specials . the cooks have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes . can get busy on fridays for a table but once seated the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly . i went there with a friend from out of town ... and we were both very impressed went on a monday night so there was no wait for a table . the sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick . the price was right too . the atmosphere was just okay . space was limited but the food made up for it . i d go back there in a heartbeat . should have gone to trader joe s and had frozen pizza lrb . my family went on a midweek evening to have dinner . the restaurant was full and there was a sign posted `` wait to be seated . well i guess it s hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff . we stood there for minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us . finally my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked `` are you waiting for a table once seated it took about minutes to finally get the meal . the prior reviews said kid friendly ... give me a break with two young children that is light years . the caesar salad i ordered had so much lemon i could n t eat it . the pizza was slightly reminescent of baker s beach pizza which occupied the the space years ago lrb a distant second rrb . it was decent but nothing exceptional . this establishment is consistent with my feelings of the rest of chow foods group . we used to frequent most of their restaurants but over the years each one has really been disapointing . i m a born and bred southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening . well i guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management to pay a visit to tutta bella in columbia city for some tips . great food better margaritas this is one of my top lunch spots huge portions fast service and amazing margaritas it gets really busy so get there on the early side so you can grab a seat if you do have to wait its not bad because the service is quick check out the art on the walls very colorful i love this place i have been eating at this place for over years now and i have never had one bad meal . i highly recommend this place to all that want to try indain food for the first time . the lunch menu is an awesome deal plenty of food trust me . fresh ingrediants and super tasty . the place is the next best thing to my moms cooking . best food phenominal service . for the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best nyc has to offer the fish is the freshest and the service is superb . not only can the selection be innovative but there s a nice balance of traditional sushi as well . the nicest waiters in town . way overrated this place is unbelievably overrated . if i want to stand in line on sunday for an hour to get average brunch food then i would put murphy s at the top of the list . the regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive . your a sushi fan you love expertly cut fish great sake a killer soho location and of course salmon tuna fluke yellow tail cod mackeral jellyfish sea urchin shrimp lobster sea bream trout milk fish blue fin tuna eel crab sardine monk fish roe scallop oysters and a varity of toro . there is only one place on the east coast that has it all plus a lot more . better than nobu tomoe taka yama sugiyama and the rest . bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world blue ribbon sushi . believe it baby cut to the chase this is amazing it s unpretentious and underground . it s fresh welcoming delicious and relaxing . hands down the best tuna i have ever had . blue ribbon lives up to it s fantastic reputation . i went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again . what a find well worth it . great value sushi with high quality & nice setting . good for late night dining lrb last minute planning rrb without reservations . try the chef s choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty . poor customer service / poor pizza . as with most restaurants in seattle mioposto s service was bad and the food was overpriced . i know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places but mioposto s pizza lacks quality and good taste . to be honest i ve had better frozen pizza . i m not kidding . the only positive thing about mioposto is the nice location . love it every time . i was frankly shocked when i read the bad reviews this place is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way and we ve eaten here more than times . people complain about the dim lighting but that is one what i love about this place if you want to stare at your food in bright light go to mcdonalds . the food is fantastic and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we ve been there . the only problem would be the wait but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting . never had one single problem there . seafood plus . this was great dining experience . if you re going to see danny gans or just staying at the mirage do n t miss this one . the appetizer of oysters lobster crab lrb small size rrb made a perfect entre for my wife . seabass on lobster risotto was the best . caesar salad was superb . great bottle of wine . leave room for dessert . completely over rated i will have to do more research before checking out new places based on diners driveins and dives reviews . i noice most reviews mention the bad service . the food was ok but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served . even then the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items . we had a very hard time getting the waitress attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager . as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token discount on our bill . when the bill came he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks . it was clear he did n t really care . with so many great breakfast/lunch places in so cal this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit . avoid the place . save yourself the waste of time & do not visit . i made my trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online . when i got there i sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible i waited for minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again . after sitting there with my empty glass for over minutes i left . i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n t work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link . i never heard back from anyone more than a month ago . after telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar . after sitting at the bar for over minutes the bar keep had made only drinks & kept telling us she d be right with us . we left without ever getting service . as of writing this i just tried their give away a link again & it still does n t work . there are so many better places to visit best crab cakes in town . thats a big statement considering i ve been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since i was about seven but something about these little devils gets better every time . if you can come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening . great seasonal fish and seafood with a classy waterfront setting . always a winner . great pizza poor service . love their pizza especially the mushroom pizza . also love their caeser salad . prefer to order it and pick it up though because i do n t like the servers one young woman in particular . she does n t make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance . but she is very friendly with certain people making it even more annoying . management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners . many people talk about the great pizza and poor service so it ca n t just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers . it s a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n t so impersonal and corporatelike . great breakfast . this place is famous for their breakfast . they have been featured on the food network and they deserve it . the food is great and they make a mean bloody mary . i love breakfast here . their crab eggs benedict is addicting . all their menu items are a hit and they serve mimosas . does n t get any better than that . best chinese food i have tasted in a long time . we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night . there was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area . you can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing . the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning . not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up . the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese . we ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food . first off the food came fast and all together rrb i like that ... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other . so about the prawns they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty . yummy . best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted . next one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli . the brocollis were so fresh and tasty . i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time every piece was as eventful as the first one ... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked . not chewy at all . for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee ... oh la la yummy melt in your mouth . we are for sure coming back to this restaurant . every month if possible . it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel ... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss esp if your in downtown san jose . chintzy portions . the sushi here is perfectly good but for $ a piece either the slices of fish should be larger or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant lrb even for nyc rrb . we easily spent more than $ per person lrb not including alcohol rrb and were still hungry . i m astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ . terrible service food ok pricey . this past weekend had great weather for san francisco standards . so for the ` after beach excursion we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to park chalet . the restaurant was busy however there were a few tables open . we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it d be a minute wait . so here we are my wife year old daughter and i trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building lrb where the murals and artifacts are rrb . minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off . we went back to the restaurant and low and behold we were seated at one of the tables that was available minutes ago logic behind that none that i can think of . we put in our order and although we ordered appetizers the food did n t arrive until minutes later ... with our main course . um so now what are appetizers for oh i forgot to mention that they do n t have bread service . its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag . my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water lrb she had a sore throat rrb and i guess that since it was only water it was n t a priority for them to actually bring it . in other words if they are n t making $ $ off of you then you do n t rate high on their ` service scale . food wise its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n t a fancy place . the upside of the restaurant if i needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or golden gate park . its great if you spent the day there and did n t want to drive to eat . parking is reasonably good they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby . another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides . i d hate for tourists to go to park chalet and think that this is how all san francisco restaurants are like . always good . a sushifiend friend recently visited and our group of three just had to come for dinner . on a sat before a broadway play and we were quickly seated and served . amazing spanish mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi lrb that eel with avodcao um um um rrb . as usual the omikase did n t disappoint in freshness although it scored low on creativity and selection . their specialty rolls are impressive though i ca n t remember what we had . great selection of sakes . green tea creme brulee gets better each time i have it . it is n t the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time . very poor customer service . schooner or later s charming location along the marina in long beach and average food does not unfortunately compensate for its very poor customer service . while this diner had reasonably good food the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service . as part of a small party of four our food was dropped off without comment ; . any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table . when we finally were able to flag someone down it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food who was also not the same person who had taken our order . after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant . a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment to say we had been `` blown off would be an understatement . the manager continually interrupted with `` is there anything else i can do for you a strange comment because she had hardly listened let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience . she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage but we could hardly take her promise seriously seeing as she had n t bothered to get the waitresses name . in short schooner or later could n t have cared less about our being at their establishment . next time we will go somewhere else or try other restaurants close by like mimi s cafe and claim jumper . o clock in the morning . you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi ... then this might be the place . the fish was fresh though it was cut very thin . great service . good sake selection . dungeness crabs here ray s is the place to go for high quality seafood dinners . and they give good quantity for the price . we were only in seattle for one night and i m so glad we picked rays for dinner i love dungeness crabs and at ray s you can get them served in about different ways we shared the family platter and i especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu . i ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting ... yummy and the service was simply spendid quite a delight . great breakfast . great drinks corn beef hash coffee b fast burritos gluten free menu . the service is fantastic at this fun place . if there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a place is open you know it is great . this is the case at this gem . best neighborhood standby . you ca n t go wrong here . every neighborhood has a few great local bars that are the best secrets . in grammercy/union square/east village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot . the music is great no night better or worse the bar tenders are generous with the pouring and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits . seriously you ca n t go wrong if it is unpretentious local fun you seek . oh and the cheese fries are awesome good food great service average prices lrb for the strip rrb . i decided to eat at stack because of their price fixed preshow dinner . when i walked in i was taken aback by their incredible wood decor . the music playing was very hip something pop music but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat which became annoying midway through dinner . we were quickly seated and requested the special dinner which came with rrb shellfish and shrimp appetizer or caesar salad rrb oz steak lrb with a single potato chip rrb and rrb homemade donut holes . i got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright . it was n t the freshest seafood ever but the taste and presentation was ok . before the steak came the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested i pick something from the menu . i picked the asparagus which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared . it was steamed and tossed with garlic . the oz steak came next and it tasted great at least initially . the steak was done to my exact liking lrb medium rare rrb and was nice and juicy . it s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction though both were indistinguishable in taste . though one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak . my mouth felt very dry afterwards and i had that signature ... msg ... taste lingering in my throat after i left the restaurant . finally the homemade donut holes were served for desert . they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and nottoosweet . the desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner . the dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip almost $ after tax and tip lrb about average rrb . but the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly . overall i would go back and eat at the restaurant again . just remember to dress a little urbanchic so you don t look too far out of place . good sake good food i honestly do n t know much about japanese food at all . in the past sake usuallly just tasted kind of like salty water to me . server made several sake suggestions which were very good . had many dishes but the best was the lobster ways . very good overpriced . we dined at the colorado location today . waited minutes for a table for which was ok for such a big crowd . the waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded . also there was only one bathroom stall probably need more for such big crowds . most importantly we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu . at best the food was good and definately overpriced . for the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower . not sure if i would go back . my favortie pizza joint in seattle . this is my `` must bring out of town guests to restaurant and they always enjoy and rave about it . in fact many want to return a second time during their visit . the pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic . i ve always found the wait staff and if you sit at the bar the cooks very friendly . they are n t the most talkative but everytime i ve been there they have been very busy which probably accounts for the lack of conversation . i also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant . it s just the right size for the menu . excellent . my husband and i love eating at mioposto café . we re ca n t say enough about their delicious gourmet pizza s you wo n t be disappointed by their menu . the pizza s are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings . you never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there . the pizza s are light and scrumptious . try the pizza ensalata it s a salad on top of pizza crust . absolutely delicious . the pizza s are not huge and the crust is thin ... keep that in mind when you re ordering . worth the wait . had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning but it was so worth it . the food is sinful . the staff was really friendly . the atmosphere was great . the specialty here is decadent pancakes but i ve been back now four times and i ve been wowed every time . nothing on the menu is less than amazing . go with some friends wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe and enjoy more than your average breakfast . good eats . whose writing all the great reviews why is it that lrb almost rrb every good review is by `` anonymous i do n t know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place . i have been to this place folks and it is bad . maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that s halfway decent . i have been here spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment . fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $ dollar plate and not one was eatable . donot go delicious . the atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate . the best dish are the honwy walnut prawns just outstanding . the service is really attentive and charming . locations . they have locations . the listed and then one in southglenn mall parking lot which is reviewed here and one in ft collins . we waited for an hour to be seated . the service was excellent the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding . it was worth the wait . plan on waiting minutes . will definitely be back . southglenn is largest location . delicious ... i recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful restaurant on street and wow what a great evening we had . the food is fantastic authentic delicious and very very affordable . the decor was beautiful and unique . there was a really nice vibe about the place ... good music atmosphere and happy looking people . our server was very professional and friendly . to the owners of open sesame ... bravo ... i ca n t wait to come back to dine at your restaurant delectable . it s a tiny place so if you get there before on a weekend lrb thurs sun rrb you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar . once you re inside the real experience begins . everything and i mean everything on the menu is delectable . the waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa . the sushi is as fresh as it comes you d think ocean was in their backyard no joke if you re interested in good tasting lrb without the fish taste or smell rrb large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place ... . big thick pepperoni . the pepperoni s cut real thick yum . the pizza itself is not exactly the best i ve had ever but still pretty good . i probably would n t go back though ` cuz i do n t know if it s worth it . maybe i ll go back once more many years from now when i ve forgotten i went there already . sit in the balcony . not bad . food was good and appetizing . portions was just enough for me but may not be for a big eater . fair menu selection . the appetizer was interesting but the creme brulee was very savory and delicious . indoor ambience was modern . if it s nice outside request for a table in the balcony . it s a great place to people watch . although the service could be improved considering the money you put in . our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times . should checkup on us more frequently do n t you think late night dinning with exeptional food . i did n t want to go there because of the reviews and prices i saw on the internet . that was the last night in vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing so we walked in the check the place . we were seated right away the table was private and nice . the service was exceptional sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters . the food was very good filet mignon was probably the best i ve ever try . the portions are big though so do not order too much . groovy music made the dinner casual . the most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places . i have a but here there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd . the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser . there were bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink . i felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom . this place rocks mercedes restaurant is so tasty the service is undeniably awesome the chips and salsa are so yummy and the prices are fabulous . the atmosphere is aspiring and the decor is festive and amazing . the catering is out of this world and raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world drinks are suberb and i feel like i am in a third world country when i walk in the door . insultingly overpriced . mediocre service/quality . this review is for the southglen location which is not listed in citysearch i wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service so this review as well as the other negative ones for their larimer location will go unaddressed . the presentation of snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu . to start off approximately oz of orange juice will cost you $ . they serve it in a tall skinny hourglass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket . i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their menu was so unique that i continued . the pancakes were certainly inventive but $ for pancakes lrb one of them was more like rrb in the pancake flight lrb sample of different pancakes rrb is well overpriced . the pancakes should be larger lrb at least rrb to justify the expense even with the unique offerings . the flavors were good but i have had far better pancakes at a german pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger . on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking and would have had to send them back again if i had n t rejected the meal all together . i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue . to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was . in the end our check came to $ for small pancakes a breakfast burrito an orange juice and an iced tea lrb i had water rrb . this was times what the same meal would have cost at le peep . snooze provided an inventive pancake offering but le peep would have provided better service and quality . much more than just a great view i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray s boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations . ray s is something of a seattle institution but given its gorgeous sound views i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service . imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the thirdbest thing about ray s to start things off our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order . my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious and we splurged on the shilshole sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns smoked albacore tuna ray s fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill scallops in a tasty soy dressing and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce . for my entr&eacute;e i completely enjoyed the seared alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard artichoke hearts fennel and pecorino toscano . the scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique lrb not to mention tasty rrb . my friend enjoyed the grilled alaskan king salmon with delectable creamed washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans . i had a taste of all three items on her plate and they were superb . our server continued to be attentive throughout the night but i did remain puzzled by one issue who thinks that ray s is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner ... they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table . given that ray s is a seafood restaurant ... well you get the idea ... . all considered i have to say that ray s boathouse is deserving of its title as a seattle institution . while i could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one . oh yeah ... the view was good too . this computer is absolutely amazing plus hours of battery... super fast processor and really nice graphics card.. and plenty of storage with gb though i will upgrade this and the ram.. this computer is really fast and i m shocked as to how easy it is to get used to... i ve only had mine a day but i m already used to it... get this computer for portability and fast processing the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run. i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it. and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it. as a computer science student in college i find that the portability longevity and ease of use of this computer make me shockingly want to do homework more; without a big ol clunky machine in my backpack i feel like i can do programming homework anywhere. i highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college. a great feature is the spotlight search one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document. oh my goodnessi am not a happy camper. my hp is very heavy. not easy to carry. the battery has never worked well. the battery gets so hot it is scary. yet hp won t do anything about the problem. i returned the computer to hp and they kept it for months. when i got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct hp told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem. so you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item. currently if i use the laptop i can t sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs. well they don t care a bunch. but at the same time they the company would not and could not do anything about my problem. i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful. and if you are going to deal with hp be careful. in my house hp is a nasty word. since i purchased my toshiba netbook i have been very pleased with it i have a laptob and a desktop. the netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me. the screen takes some getting use to because it is smaller than the laptop. i have not have any problems. the notebook pc toshiba qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me. he gave me this pc about years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it. its still going. it is in the best condition and has a really high quality. this is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone. you will not regret buying such a great thing like this it can t get any better. waited on getting this computer but it has been a great change. ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac. this laptop meets every expectation and windows is great it s fast it s easy easy easy to set up easy to hook to my wireless network. it s even easy to hook up to other wireless networks. the battery doesn t last long but i m sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem. i don t use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it s perfect for me. most everything is fine with this machine speed capacity build. the only thing i don t understand is that the resolution of the screen isn t high enough for some pages such as yahoo mail. i bought it for really cheap also and it s amazing. recommended to people as their first laptop. plain and simple it laptop runs great and loads fast. easy to carry can be taken anywhere can be hooked up to printers headsets. i m already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown. being a pc user my whole life it s taking a bit of time to adapt to the os of a mac but i m finding my way around. the unibody design is edgy and durable. the led backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more. i m learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages. a key contributor that led me to mac is the art aspect. they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and i m looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular. i m excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same. it s more expensive but well worth it in the long run. great product very easy to use and great graphics. one drawback i wish the keys were backlit. i m glad i bought this laptop it was worth the few extra dollars. it had most of the features and all of the power that i wanted to replace my desktop machine. i wasn t really as concerned about portability it s a very large laptop but it s not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise. i m very happy with this machine i love the size keyboard the functions. i don t really have a complaint. it is easy to use good quality and good price. perfect trifecta i would recommend this product. the salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it. this is my first dell i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it the dvd burner broke after burning dvd d during that time they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later. if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before i spoke to different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a person needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever purchase breaking within year of purchase and speaking to people to report the damaged part will be returned late i do not recommend this company or their products so far a great product. high price tag however. still trying to learn how to use it. it is the worst computer dell ever made. it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one. breaks easily. only good thing is the graphics quality. there are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new macbook no viruses this laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials. i am loyal to apple. i am very happy this just keeps having it s hard drive replaced acer won t replace the laptop. the manufacturer s warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts. this thing is a lemon. this macbook is an outstanding product with great value. its ease of use and the top service from apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar cannot be beat. suffice it to say my macbook pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed. it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern. i have had nothing but problems since the day i took it out of the box my first problem was with the preloaded norton firewall/security program. it would not let me connect to my wifi system where i lived. it took toshiba tech support calls and different techs to correct the problem. then just the other day my left mouse button snapped being only months old i am not a happy camper buyer beware. this one in my opinion might be a lemon it rarely works and when it does it s incredibly slow. i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses times and i have not even had it for more then months *if you are looking for a good laptop this is not it like the price and operation. some features arent friendly volume wheel sound quality etc. but for the cost this is a winner. i absolutely love my mac i can t imagine my life without it anymore i ve haven t had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off. apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached. i can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly. i called toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem. i think i might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion. i bought this laptop was the worst laptop i ve ever bought. i spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare. and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare. they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn t work. and that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed. its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop. so if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it... i saved for this laptop for months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait. the display on this computer is the best i ve seen in a very long time the battery life is very long and very convienent. a little pricey but it is well well worth it. it is amazing. in the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced. after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working months of use which was frustrating. then after or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running. a tip for people looking into this computer do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last. has a hour battery life. it is easy to use and lightweight. was very much worth the price i paid. this netbook went bad on me after days. there is a blank lighted screen when i start and that is all. three weeks after i bought the netbook the screen quit working. i baby my electronics so i know for a fact it was defective and not anything that i did to it. overall i feel this netbook was poor quality had poor performance although it did have great battery life when it did work. took the netbook on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop. the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it do not buy it it is the worst laptop ever the image is great and the soud is excelent. i love ths notebook. i love the glass touchpad. easy learning curve. also the display is exceptional i have loved this since i took it out of the box. the battery is really long. the features are great the only thing it needs is better speakers. small and light weight. speakers too small to be of any real use. keyboard good sized and wasy to use. i like it meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis. needless to say not to happy with the product. this is a great machine the design is awesome quality is unprecedented. apparently wellbuilt and gorgeous to look at the macbook pro is a winning combination of price and performance. it is by far one of the greatest investments i have ever made. am very glad i bought it great netbook low price. very good quality and well made. great pick for portability and affordability. the black model also has a very nice seamless appearance one of the better looking notebooks i ve seen. the only problem is a lack of screen resolutions if you need an affordable entrylevel laptop this will fit the bill. i dislike the weight and size cubersome. i dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers. overall it s ok. laptop is advertised as a but the casing looks like that of a . this laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases. peformance is good for the price. if you re not wanting to be mobile this is a good laptop to sit on a desk. had to have this computer repaired twice in the first months after purchasing it. not good for a person who gets online daily. may be better for the occasional web surfer. i just got this laptop for college and so far i am very happy with it. it is so much easier to use good keyboard long battery life largest hard drive and windows and toshiba is a quality supplier. i love this little one. the keyboard has a wonderful nature feel. great battery life. keyboard is reasonable size. small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel. charger seems large for this class of computer. great laptop for the price works well with action pack games. the only thing that i have is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters would help if it was a little lighter then it is. but other then that i would give this product a in hafe stars. good for every day computing and web browsing. a great computer for light home use and business use. might not make the avid gamer happy but i don t really think that is what this computer is designed for. crisp screen great battery life and plenty of storage. very happy. he loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started. i would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school. my only problem is i can not reg. the product key. it want take it it keep saying error. help help other than that gets a great little wonder. it s fast and has excellent battery life. the screen shows great colors. i was surprised with the performance and quality of this hp laptop. the speed is fine. but with a way bigger screen and is able to connect to an hdmi. love it. i would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop and the battery life is amazing. i bought this lap top and the charge time dosen t last as long as they say it will more like hours this computer is the ideal college companion. it s software and speed enable it to do amazing things. i am not happy at all with the product i purchased. a cheaper price should not equal a cheap product. it was over rated the toshiba laptop was a great purchase. the price was very good and the product is top quality. the delivery was fast and i would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again. it has easy to use features and all the speed and power i could ask for. true quality at a great price i am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great toshiba is a great brand even though i haven t had it for a long time i am very happy with it the screen graphics and clarity and sharpness are great. i ve already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye d the computer when i took it out of my bag. i like the laptop overall. the only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time. sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to work this is a great little computer for the price. simple to use and great graphics. it has everything i would need for a home computer. i m very impressed. it was secure and easy to navigate. it is everything that i would want in a computer. besides the great look it is a great machine. once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts. i enjoy very much my new toshiba purchased specifially for attending online schooling. i have found it very easy to use very imformative wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs. i have found also it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access; without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so. i also love the small convenient size of my laptop making it a perfect tool for my academic studies. i am very pleased with my purchase this laptop serves all my needs. screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment. price and purpose is awesome i have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop. the battery life seems to be very good and have had no issues with it. great product. the laptop was very easy to set up. everything was so easy. they were able to setup with labtops themselves within a few minutes. it works fine with our wireless and they ve had not problems. it s a great product for a great price waited on getting this computer but it has been a great change. ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac. the service i received from toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty. my friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance picture quality and ease of use. it is extremely portable and easily connects to wifi at the library and elsewhere. just what the doctor ordered. i cannot be happier with the service or product. power supply went bad after weeks after much effort and days asus replaced it the wifi is very weak. summary spend your money elsewhere this is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life. love it so far. the toshiba net book operates very well. the only objection i have is that after you buy it the windows system is a starter and charges for the upgrade. i bought this netbook for traveling and it s great light functional and meets my needs. the touchpad is extremely sensitive which is the only drawback. otherwise i love it i wasn t really sure i wanted to spend that kind of money it was a great deal after all. i love it i should have bought one a long time ago. not enough time for me to give it stars i ve had the macbook pro for about three weeks and it really is a great computer. i have only had pcs with windows before so this takes a little getting use to. the real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it s speed. it is fast booting up shutting down and connection with the internet. the one thing i wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel. i think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive but i rather have a hard copy. if what you need is a machine to do some surfing email checking word processing and watching a movie or two this is the machine you want. it s priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box. nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents. the screen/video resolution won t increase to a higher resolution then x that being said it still runs video in full screen decently. the sound is a bit quiet if you re on a plane this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones. bottom line i doubt you d be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine. yes i thought the expese was a little much but i now realize you get what you pay for. i love my apple it is quick and easy to use. i ve had to call apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful english speaking from vancouver techs that walked me through the processes to help me. i can t say enough of how satisfied i am with their product and help aftermarket. money and time well spent highly recommended the macbook pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great product. the macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box all the functions works great. speakers doesn t sound that great. love the speed especially so glad i decided to upgrade i ve owned this labtop for less then two months already the mouse button has broke. still under warrenty so called toshiba no help at all. i m stuck w/ a broken computer. will not buy another toshiba this is my second not happy w/ either. i love its solid build light wt and excellent battery life for now . excellent led monitor and well equipped. i love the apple products. the toshiba mini notebook model nb is a great little computer. it is easy to use its keyboard easily accommodates large hands and its weight is fantasic. upgrading from windows starter thru windows home premium to windows professional was a snap; both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary product key. other installed features such as certain printer software are also most attractive. ever since i bought this laptop so far i ve experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services i received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines. i constantly had to send my laptop in for services every months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed. toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another and i am not kidding you i called different hours of the day and you ll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again since they make it sound like they don t have your history list of your calls right in front of them. it s a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them. and at one point they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop i bought the memory stick they recomended . long story short since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one i didn t ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services they finally gave in. was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba i ll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba. remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product. all i can say is wow. this laptop is insane it s so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with. i bought a protector for my key pad and it works great this is definitely a computer worth the money; the mouse is a little bit different than what you re used to though it has one big flat panel and one full bar instead of two separate ones to click with but you get used to it quite quickly. and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer when they have a certain promotion/offer going of course overall this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from. the apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you obviously this macbook is perfect for me because it does exactly what i need in an easytofunction way. definitely recommended not a bad laptop it s a bit slow but gets the job done. the lcd screen stopped working on mine after months. i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat. upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had months left on the warranty. even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had months left on the warranty. dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture. english must have been his third or fourth language. his language was so bad i swore i was taking the turing test and it was failing. after trying to get some help he disconnected on me. after days being denied times and told off once i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt. then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me. after they found no other way they told me to courier it to them since they don t allow the use of the post office at my expense and sent me a page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn t be covered. i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me. they really do have the worlds very worst repair service. this computer gets very hot before shutting down. it is not ideal for children because of the temp. i contacted hp about this situation and was given excuses without results. they didn t even try to assist me or even offer a replacement. i will never purchase a hp again ever. let s just get this out of the way i love apple but the macbook is the best it is super easy to use. all you have to do is turn it on and it works. it is very durable i am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet. i don t do any high tech stuff on it just write papers check mail and sometimes play games so i can t reccomend it if you are in the computer field. in the past four years i ve had it i have never once gotten a virus. i did have to replace the battery once but that was only a couple months ago and it s been working perfect ever since. i would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use stylish fun awesome computer. also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable easy to use computer. this laptop does everything i need it to very well. the best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features. the screen is bright and the keyboard is nice; i find myself using the more than i thought i would. battery is lasting about hours as i am surfing the web on sundays while checking football scores and watching funny youtube videos. for those that care about noise this thing doesn t really make any; the processor doesn t seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on. i took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it. i wish toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the os at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff. once i removed all the software the laptop loads in seconds. this is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine; my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn t require a dedicated video card. overall i am very satisfied with the purchase. great quick laptop for the money. right size and weight for portability. battery life needs more life. battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery. i love everything about it. the only downfall is the battery only last hrs when not plugged in. i would like at least a hr. battery life. otherwise all other features are a this mac is great lightweight long battery life excellent transition from pc; this has been nothing but a headache since we purchased it. i will never buy refurbished again i don t cae how cheap it is. just don t waste your time and money on this. i tried giving it stars but i had to choose at least one but imo no stars summary dont buy hp. if you buy pray you dont have major prolems. runs hot i thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an apple product. after a little more than a year of owning my macbook pro the monitor has completely died. this purchase opened me to the world of macbooks and i am impressed with the intuition of the design the beauty of the product and the excellent technological advances associated with it. then of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the macbook pro. now they are believers in the product. it is easy to use has great screen quality and every so light weight. this little netboook is helping me get work done i homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat. i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the mac offers. i bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her it s very lightweight and the response for the computing she s doing internet focused activity mail research etc. is excellent; the overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she d recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook. if you re looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphicsintensive game you d be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market. previous laptops were pc s still have them but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system. still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better but am very happy with the upgrade. probably as good as you can get in a netbook does everything i ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses. has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device. so far so good i ve been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory. i don t understand why only windows starter is included. strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed this device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers. enjoy that toshib force and durability unparalleled needs longer lasting battery more than to hrs. needs power and mouse cable to plug in back instead of side in the way of operating a mouse in small area. for the use it was purchased for it is a good laptop. comfterbale to use light easy to transport. i love this product because it is toshiba and its . it has no camera but i can always buy and install one easy. i had a usb connect but i can t use it because it is not compatible. that s the downside for me. but i would recommend this product. satisfy what i paid for it. good monitor and performed well. i am using the external speaker sound is good. best thing is i can use existing bit old programs. i recommend for word processing and internet users. the games included are very good games. i would highly recommend this one to my friends i bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio. it works great for general internet use microsoft office apps home bookkeeping etc. it doesn t have a lot of frills but i didn t need any and being able to buy what i needed and not more than i needed was very important. this computer i used daily nice compact design. excellent speed for processing data. and if you are a game player it works with world of warcraft wonderfully. all in all great item highly recommend it. i would have to say that overall its great aside from the trial software and the short battery life lack of a webcam its great. fast great visual oh yea has no numeric pad on the side. best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches to make less easier for people to hack into my favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so i can connect it to a bigger screen. great wifi too. the screen is a little glary and i hated the clicking buttons but i got used to them. overall for the money this is a good deal. there is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer. the speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones i have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music i suggest you get something better. while the keyboard itself is alright the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons. i am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite i like the extra features i love the windows home premium. the battery life has not decreased since i bought it so i m thrilled with that. i also love the design the looks the feel and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull. i would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend. couldnt not use it. tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk. defective software. returned it to walmart. i would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front. i also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen. i went to toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it. one of them seems to have worked. its a good laptop for its value. use is easy. features like the font are very blocklike and old school. would like more trendy high tech features. the start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking. keys stick periodically and i havent had the laptop for days yet. came fully loaded good. seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ie internet tabs programs etc simultaneously. i m really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer. graphics are clean and sharp internet interfaces are seamless. only issue is that it is a little slow and i m fixing that by adding more ram. sound card is limited though. the laptop is very lightweight can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight. it is small enough to fit in one of my purses windows starter is terrific no you can t change the background but i don t need to i use it just for school work. the battery life is amazing the versitility is outstanding. the ease of set up was terrific. i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and install one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever. i had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity because it is very sensitive. keyboard is great very quiet for all the typing that i do. screen is crystal clear yes it s small but it s a netbook awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college. i couldn t believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge. i loaded windows via bootcamp and it works flawlessly simply amazing computer i really like the mac notebook but its very pricey. love the graphics awesome programs including garageband and really cool default background. but like i said before the only reason i don t currently have a mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey. waiting for the was well worth it great value for the price. bigger hd better graphics card and a bid hd. there is nothing to complain about the system. i have used pc s and converting to this macbook pro was easy. if you have the money i suggest going for the i occassionaly use it for work via vpn and it has not given me any problems. the screen is nice and the images comes very clear the keyboard and the fit just feels right. i consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need. the price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop. i ts nice to have the higherend laptops but this fits my budget and the features i need. i normally dont participate in reviews/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts... another satisfied customer. the apple macbook is the best investment that i have ever made. the newer macbook that i have purchased is one of the best computers. i am a college student and it has been very useful. it has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer. it has a lot of memory and a great battery life. it is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed. its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes. iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites. the internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily. i have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me. the screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use very important for use quick typers. overall this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase the graphics are stunning. it s wonderful for computer gaming. i would definitely suggest this laptop it is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all. it has many great programs such as ilife iphotos and others. ilife is easily compatible with microsoft office so you can send and receive files from a pc. in addition all the design tools on pages and keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations. this comes in very handy for me as an educator. iphotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos. it allows you to automatically upload photos to your facebook account with one click. in addition there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture. if you are looking for something reliable this is the laptop for you. this computer was awful i will never buy another computer from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company. the computer first started malfunctioning months after purchasing it. it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it. the system it comes with does not work properly so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all. when calling dell for help reurn or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it. one year of trying to fix the computer by myself with help of friends and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to fix it. this computer was awful i would never recomend it to another person. those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall yeah i wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire. that s how frustrating it was. it is so simple to use i use it more than my desktop. it is well worth the money it cost very good investment. the new macbook pro inch is nothing short of amazing. the speed is incredible and i am more than satisfied. bought from walmart i believe that this laptop was a repaired item. this laptop was bad from the first day of usebrought it back to store for return of money. now am very aprehensive about toshiba laptops. will not every buy anotherlou this is a great value for the money. this is a great computer. we haven t had any problems with it at all. the body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up. overall though for the money spent it s a great deal. but let me tell you the mac book pro is so professional. its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer. for example when my husband turns the light out while i m on the computer. the screen brightness automatically adjusts. it is very easy to type on and feels great besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted. oh it is such a great piece of equipment. its office compatible but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs. i get a ton of compliments on its size and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you re restricted to the width of your body for computing room. very longlife battery up to hours depending on how you configure power level settings . i upgraded the memory and replaced the base windows starter to win home and it runs just fine. i play a lot of casual games online and the touchpad is very responsive. i wouldn t play a firstperson shooter with this mind but if you wanted to run ms office email chat download a video listen to music from a certain fruitnamed music store and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in i d highly recommend checking this out. the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook screen size is not something i d stare at for the entire hours of battery life five days a week. additional caveat the base installation comes with some toshibaspecific software that may or may not be to a user s liking. everything from the design to the os is simple and to the point. love it love it love it it really is perfect for work and play. i am able to play and media files just fine with it. everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome. the only thing that isn t perfect about this netbook is the speakers they are not loud at all but i expected that. i upgraded it s ram to i am very happy with it. lots of preloaded software. the only problem is that i had to add gb ram the computer was kinda slow. tosiba has a good reputation my llast computer was an acer. this is starting off good. what a great little laptop. maybe not the cutting edge satellite but it is a workhorse. i bought it to use in college and it is perfect. i dual boot with linux and that other securityprone os and it performs flawlessly. i made a perfect decision when i bought the toshiba excellent product for the money. no problems no lock ups no disappointments. not super fancy but not super expensive either. highly recommend for daily use. the computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks. i have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed. toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done. i would tell the technician i knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and i had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me i needed to send the computer in. this computer that i have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions. as well as having the plug in the computer come loose. so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good. it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there. the mac book pro performs flawlessly. never had a single problem and don t have to worry about viruses. while i mostly use it for email internet and gaming i m confident all other applications live up to the high standard i ve come to appreciate from mac laptops. worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment. right out of the box this little netbook did everything i asked of it including streaming the everyday video you re bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously . it even has a great webcam and skype works very well. the fact that you can spend over on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine. the windows starter is in my opinion a great way to think about using your netbook basics basics basics. i wiped nearly everything off of it installed openoffice and firefox and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price. this netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop my wife and i have another laptop or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks. i use this for my tutoring business and since i m always bouncing from student to student it is ideal for portability and battery life yes it gets the hours as advertised . asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them. little short on ram but you get what you pay for. the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer left right and front. the headphone and mic jack are in front of touchpad making the touchpad hard to use when using headphones/mic not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person. cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction. i love windows but i can t give toshiba any credit for that unless y all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time. i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty. the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june and returned on july seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned. they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place. the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by toshiba. the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue. instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some miles by air to louisville ky. and toshiba is totally unconcerned. the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter. we don t mind and you don t matter. i would not recommend the purchase of this modle of toshiba computer or any toshiba product for that matter. when it come time for warranty service to toshiba you don t matter. windows vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service. i ve tried going back to xl but there still problems. the technical service for dell is so world it might as well not even bother. just a bunch of idiots who s english as a language is forced at best. i m all for saving money but dell needs to step it up. good price. basic computer. didn t work when shipped from walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop same make/model . it has worked fine. handles all my basic media needs easily. can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display. it is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not. it s a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs. it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part. the gb of ram is plenty able to run windows and at least or other programs with next to no slowdown. my one complaint with this laptop is that i ve noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in. this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components and i m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator but i still expected better product quality for this price range. other than that i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semidecent gaming capabilities. let me start with the good so awesome. great os fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port. this one has had the same effect. the improvements to the os have been relatively gradual but substantive. the unibody construction is solid sleek and beautiful. it is everything i d hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint but somehow a bit more sturdy. for the not so good i got the stock screen which is very glossy. it s still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook. the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlledlighting environment like me i prefer it dark or if you can crank up the brightness. the statement of hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration it s a lie. i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than hrs out of it. the first full charge of this battery got me only about full hours. enabling the battery timer is useless. the time remaining goes from hours plus to less than hours over the span of about minutes. it s so bad that i m thinking i only got half a battery or something. i know what hrs of battery looks like. my only other complaint is that it gets really hot. if you buy this don t go into it expecting hrs of battery life and you ll be perfectly satisfied. the pro is a great product i wish that the inch models came with the intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge the edges hurt my wrists . other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more. great product by apple with the new great looking design. i actually had the hard drive replaced twice the mother board once the dvd drive twice then they finally agreed to replace it all of this in less than years only to get another hp/compaq piece of crap. it was slow locked up and also had hardware replaced after only months so buyers beware it is made better thicker and all out tough i droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and it is still working with no issues i love the easy to see screen and it works well for work persoal or just play. i tell everyone i see out looking to get this or another toshiba. my friends or children use that when they need to borrow the net = when i out grow this meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one and i will be buying only toshiba i just love this lap top i just wish it were all silver or they had all black. that is my only complaint love this laptop wonderful price for what you get would pay more for it if i had too i recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling. i am totally satisfied with my little toshie from the moment i opened the box to the present it has been a great joy. it is always reliable never bugged and responds well. i love the operating system and the preloaded software. this machine delivers. it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an alienware gaming machine. it is a bit heavy. it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required. had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in. this is an oversized laptop. it wouldn t fit in most bags. i was disappointed when i realized that the keyboard doesn t light up on this model. it also does not have bluetooth. you ll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them. i was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing i took it for granted that these features were standard. overall still a very nice machine. boots up fast and runs great i m pleased. the acer one compuer is a great computer. i didn t want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice. its fast has high definition quality in the videos. the pictures are clear as can be. if i had to buy another computer i would most definetly buy an acer one computer. heck if i had enough money i would but it as a gift for someone. im glad that it has such great features in it. it also came with a built it web cam which is great because i can see an communicate with my family members back home. clear picture on it and everything. the one down side to it is that when i play a certin game on here it tends to freeze up sometimes but thats the only bad thing about this computer. the acer one computer that i bought is ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it but i like the big screen on it. its good for playing my apps on facebook or watching movies. im very happy with this computer it s solid. love the stability of the mac software and operating system. the only downfall is a lot of the software i have won t work with mac and iwork is not worth the price of it. it seems to be incompatible with everything else. but the machine is awesome and ilife is great and i love snow leopard x. i love to use it it is esay and light. this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with. i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria. this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures. i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing. the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm. i can use it for all of my needs. i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me. if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again. i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go. from the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer the os is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly. the track pad to me is what really stands out though you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad awesome thinking apple the os is also very user friendly even for those that switch from a pc with a little practice you can take full advantage of this os apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience from the start when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine. the ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it. the screen is bright and clear the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice. fast fast and fast the web pages just fly by. i had my iworks itunes email ms office network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour. that includes transferring my music and movies. good bye blue screen and critical errors skype is just so dang cool with this machine too. if your time is worth anything to you if you are tired of rebooting reformatting reinstalling trying to find drivers if you want a computer to work for you for a change make the change to this computer. it is light and the battery last a very long time. very fast boot up and shut down. let me tell you this machine is great. purchased for development purposes but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing email etc. i thought learning the mac os would be hard but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a pc. the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing. the only time i have restarted is during system updates. great machine if you want to drop the cash for one. ok this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple. the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum. the processor screams and because of the unique way that apple osx functions most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software. i have recommended this laptop to everyone i know who is buying one. i like it so much i bought another just for my wife. took it back as it was defective. page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something. couldn t keep a page up you were working on was a great deal i will give that. the laptop preformed pretty well. it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once. it has times were it freezes for seconds and then starts again. the mouse on the pad the left button always sticks. the mouse is way way way to sensitve. i tried turning it done but it did nothing. the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too. its not bad just very very annoying. think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop. i am very happy with this laptop. for the price and what i get out of it has exceeded my expectations. i always have used a tower home pc and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance. amazing quality plus stylish. the big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies pictures and etc the flaws are this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x. mac is not made for gaming. but there s this application called boot camp which allows you to add another os x like windows. second it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated was not happy with one of the programs on it. it was not clear that the microsoft student edition that was loaded on the computer was a six month trial. also the extended warranty was a problem. the extended warranty for the and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu. overall the computer is very easy to use the screen is perfect great computer my daughter loves. i finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what i need it. i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased. so i m disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority. i just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and i won t have to worry about a crash. i bought this emachines notebook pc in january of this year and i am highly dissatisfied with it. the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning. it freezes and it always shows that there is an error so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it. i tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem. well i started using google chrome which is a little better but it freezes too sometimes. this notebook restarts every time there is a new update so if you don t save your files and information everything will be lost. another issue i have with it is the battery. maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden. there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle and when i click on it it says consider replacing your battery and it does not hold full charge. it is not even a year old yet so i would definitely not recommend it to anyone. don t waste your money the laptop is gorgeous. it is sleek smooth and lightweight. it is easily portable and i take it everywhere i go and might require internet access. the screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution. the processor is very quick and effective as i load webpages and applications. it is quiet and a real joy to watch work. i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the laptop in the sky overall this laptop is great. it has plenty of memory lots of hard drive and great graphics. it runs very quiet too which is a plus. the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible. they only stay charged a little over an hour. laptops are usually used on the go so why not give you a better battery the processor a amd semprom at ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for hd or heavy computing. the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a svideo port that would enable one to hook it to a tv. it is a cheap throw together. save your money and go for a better device. this laptop is a great price and has a sleek look. runs smooth and quick. i wish it had a webcam though then it would be perfect i love my new computer its fast and another thing i like is that it has three usb ports. i love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new toshiba works great on both thank you for your great product everything about this computer is easy to use. wonderful features. the only thing is that the battery won t last more than an hour. it discharges too quickly. kind of annoying but i still love the laptop. it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space. the only downfall is the volume control. the wheel that turns the volume up and down doesn t work in real time. i have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute. i bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since. i love it so much. it has come into good use for my finances scheduling my parents business expenses and it is definitely amazing for gaming. the best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once it never slows down. it s just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open. it works exactly like it did the day i took it out of the box. great investment the price and features more than met my needs. the feature are good enough for what i need. i love my macbook pro my laptop is almost old and i have never had any problems with it. if you are a pc user looking to convert i would highly recommend it it may take a little getting used to but you don t have to worry about viruses or other headaches. not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs. i am addicted to photo booth it is so much fun to play with. i work with kids and they love making short videos on there. i am able to organize my pics music and files easily. if you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac i love the keyboard. the display is awesome. only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive. but other than that i am blown away by all the features this laptop offers. i think this computer is super lame. i dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing. i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it. it doesnt work worth a damn. the display is beyond horrible. i can not even read what i am writing half of the time. there are so many things wrong with this product it just makes me want to set my self on fire i would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage. not to mention it has shit gigs. i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage. do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop. i bought this last week and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touchmouse stopped responding. got another and same issue. i am taking back today. don t waste your money or time. very dissappointed becase i have had toshibas for years and never a issue. stopped booting up less than a week after my oneyear warranty was up. toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it. apparently there is a manufacturing defect something with the amount of thermal paste. toshiba will not acknowledge this problem. when i called toshiba they would not do anything and even tried to charge me for the phone call even though they didn t offer any technical support. i loved the netbook minus the fact that it was windows os until this started happening. but if you can t make your product last more than a year you will not get my business again. i ve had my macbook pro for three years now and still love it in those three years i ve had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by apple quickly and easily. my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan. in the three years i ve had my macbook pro i have never had a virus on my computer and i do a lot of work on the internet. the ilife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product. i highly recommend this product needs constant repair. first the screen goes completely out. then hp sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up not able to connect. now the screen is going darker darker darker. hp is more interested in selling extended warranties which cost more than the netbook new then they are in helping or fixing. oh yeah don t forget the expensive shipping to and from hp. i v spent as much for shipping as i would to buy a new netbook of course a different brand. so far so good with this laptop. fan vents to the side so no cooling pad needed great feature screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive. memory is upgradable. the only thing i would change about it is the mouse keys. they click. sounds like a typewriter but if you can get past that this is a great laptop for a little money i hate this one. vista is a nightmare. no tutorials on the display. the book is useless. the machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your hdtv. thinking about returning it the macbook is a fantastic laptop. you will love this macbook if you choose to buy it. the macbook rarely requires a hard reboot. it just works flawlessly its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action. i honestly love my mac thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict. this was purchased for my daughter and i was pleasantly surprised. it had the full sized touch pad with buttons instead of just one. it made the computer much easier to use and navigate. keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel. this system came loaded with windows starter. so far so good. when i got this laptop in to help me with school i had a hard time from beginning. i feel that it was poorly put together because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it. quite simply this is the best laptop i have ever owned. for me five stars is not enough. i love the macbook pro. my parents bought it for me as a graduation gift and i m totally almost kind of maybe definitely obsessed with it. it was very easy to just pick up and use it did not take long to get used to the mac os. i love the size because the screen is big enough for what i use it for internet artwork and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable. there are several programs for school or office use pages numbers keynote etc. music garageband photo management photo booth iphoto videoediting or moviemaking imovie etc. the builtin webcam is great for skype and similar videochat services. itunes is a handy musicmanagement program and it is essential for anyone with an ipod. allinall i would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone. i love it they definitely have a superior product its not just slow on the internet its slow in general. no i am generous calling it slow. its more like a snail crawl. he can t stand it. i can t begin to say how disappointed i am. i should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer. the key bindings take a little getting used to but have loved the macbook pro. delivery was early too. it allows me to do everything i need from a computer and more. with awesome graphics and assuring security it s perfect i d recommend this laptop to anyone the toshiba satellite laptop is designed to fail the board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues. toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought toshiba will do nothing about it. i actually contact toshiba before i started having problem and was given run around after i supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired. then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i d have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty. it has far exceeded my expectations for power storage and abilitiy. it is easy to navigate and update programs. i ve never had problems with viruses. my next laptop will also be a mac i would like to tell you about the best laptop i just got from mac. my mac laptop is fabulous in both areas. it gives me the power and speed that i need to run all the programs i use to edit. the final cut pro on this laptop is so fast and easy and i can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer which is also a mac. i would buy one of these for every person in my office if i could. in my line of work i often have to take work home and this makes it so easy. i do transcription work on the side and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well. the apple care has never failed me and i expect it to be the same for this computer as well. i will only buy apple laptops from now on. great laptop for school easy to use for beginners in the household. keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable. battery life could be better but overall for the price and toshiba s reputation for laptops it s great my macbook pro has been a huge disappointment. from the build quality to the performance everything about it has been subpar from what i would have expected from apple. the system constantly overheats the battery life is too short the case is coming apart and my core applications that i use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly. i would not recommend this product to anyone. screen is awesome battery life is good. really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints. good laptop for the money. speakers don t get that loud but good enough. they don t crash. if a website ever freezes which is rare its really easy to force quit. never been hacked. no viruses. i have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free even without the warranty. a mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense. its also fun to use the programs are great like iphoto love the editing capabilities imail which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad imovie etc. she said its very user friendly. however i love this particular mac because its very fast great size and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad. i am very happy i bought this mac well worth the extra money. now that i have it i see that i really needed this for much more. i run dreamweaver final cut pro photoshop safari firefox msn messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time. i have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing. i highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door. that was my first apple product and since then i have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs i have bought. my macbook pro is no exception. since i ve had this computer i ve only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth. i also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad. the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it iphoto imovie iweb itunes garageband is all very helpful as well. i would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality shiny this laptop is the best of the best the awesomest of the awesomest. it is so great i can hardly ever take my hands off it my friends are in awe every time they come over i got it for christmas and i was so excited to set it up it is super fast and always loads. i am just amazed. the only bad part is the size/weight. it s like punds but if you can look past it it s great if you don t like fingerprints this might not be the laptop for you. it super shiny so you can see the fingerprints easily. all for such a great price. it s color is even cool. another great thing is the beast graphics. they are so realistic i am just speechless. i let my friend borrow it and she knows nothing about computers and she used it with ease. the cool thing about this is anyone can use it. i don t know how i could ever live without my qousmio. i own a hewlett packard laptop and i ve had man problems with it since i bought in in feb ive had to call tech support many times. each time taking about day or so. i had to wait weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly. i had to pay for the shipping i will never buy anything from hp again the toshiba satellite has been more than i expected for the price. this computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse. you can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever. for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is. when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke. but after i got used to it i love it. the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming. it has usb ports sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion. the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have. overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive. i use my mac all the time i love the software the way it takes a short time to load things how easy it is to use and most of all how you don t have to worry about viruses. with a mac you don t have to worry about antivirus software or firewall it s so wonderful. all apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed. this computer will last you at least years thats an amazing life spanned an electronic. everything about a mac is wonderful it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system but you will learn fast and its all worth it. not working = bad i spent dollars on a top of the line laptop . i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it. payed for a premium laptop blue screen first month horrible customer supportthey lost my laptop for a monthgot it back months later laptop still did not work blue screen within a week... cut my losses and sold it for parts this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this never happen... what an elegant wonderful machine. i m making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the old way and apple does indeed have the better idea. i really wish i had done this years ago. pairing it with an iphone is a pure pleasure talk about painless syncing used to take me forever now it s a snap. i love it never had a computer i was so impressed with and i ve had a lot of laptops and desktops this one is far and above the best one i ever had before. i tell everyone that i know friends family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used. the computer blinks it shuts off at will. the letter a stopped working after the first week. when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is twenty three days from the date of purchase. so the fact that the computer does not work on the twenty fourth day is my fault. they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem. they have not sent a new one nor called. i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus. then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east. so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand. then to make matters worst there is noone that they can transfer you to. i had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair. got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it. weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications. do not buy gateway computers they are junk and the warranty company is horrible. you will not be able to talk to an american warranty service is out of country. computer has been at service facility more than in my hands. i have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied. the only problems are the sound isnt very loud i have to wear headphones. another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed to send it in to fix it. that whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the and it was fixed. it took a little over weeks until i got it back. and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke. to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk. the graphics are great. the internet speed is spectacular. the battery life is probably an hour at best. oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all i use the old word processer which works good. i would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about. i wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month. i received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst. at first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and i send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later i then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now i have to send it back again to get it fixed again. this computer doesn t do that well with certain games it can t play some and it becomes too hot while playing games. oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn t come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is for two cds. the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop. i bought a hp pavilion laptop and have had so many problems with the computer. the computer is so slow even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up. they said it was a computer error on this type of computer. also i have alot of trouble with it getting very hot and not even sitting on anything to make it hot. when the computer has been on for several minutes it will occasionaly just go off by itself. also the battery does not last very long at all. i would recommend not buying this product. i have had no luck with staples or hp to resolve this problem. i am stuck with a laptop that i cannot do very much with. also i have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly. also i have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines. it gets stuck all of the time you use it and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work. sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer. will probably never buy a hp again. purchased a toshiba lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out. after the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace. i hate it. i have had the luxury sarcasm of owning of these laptops. the first fell apart right after the during that time i had to send it back times. i paid about for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me. none of the techs at hp knew what they were doing. they would repair one thing send it back and it would still have the same problem. the processor went on me the fan went and the motherboard went. i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused because they knew it was trouble. i had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty. i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about for the extended warranty. i sent it back and they lost it. i waited and waited and no laptop. finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box. i waited another month for approval and for them to build me a new laptop. here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing. hp didn t fix it. i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one. in months the connect quality got worse and worse. time they got it working the next month they had me send it in. returned it. months dead again. they say sorry out of warranty. summary they played games with me for the warranty period. now months later they want would not say exact amount to to fix the machine. they had me send in the machine last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything. now the machine won t connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty the repair for days and now i m out of warranty even though this has been a constant month occurance since i bought the netbook. so buyer beware when buying toshiba they are wonderful but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat. i burned my leg after lifting it from my desk and for less than second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table so i can place it there. i had to call apple times each time to minutes on the phone and take it to their store for evaluations and diagnostics times. for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin it happened months ago they offered me an itouch you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich offer a loyal customer like me a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this . steve jobs probably needs help and donations and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby. the lesson learned here is it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible as fast as they can and in this day and age the customer no longer is right all the times. i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop. anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone. so i called customer support which is good too and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all i just chose to hide the message. also the speakers are not very loud but it is a netbook. would highly recommend this netbook though. i custom ordered the machine from hp and could not understand the techie due to his accent. the computer was two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork. my laptop cost approximately and died after only and of use. although my model was listed as recalled hp denied my claim. this laptop leaves alot to be desired i have had it only months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice... i bought it from hsn because it was bundled with extra software but as it turns out that software just crashes it more often..... if you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal. the repairs were made quickly though i must say however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me. unable to boot up this brand new laptop. spent hours on phone with hp technical support. they went through asking me open up various components taking battery out hard disk apart and after hours on phone could not fix it. they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site. i am going to go back and return at store i bought from this computer had exactly the specifications i needed. small enough to use on a long flight light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips. the perfect notebook... when i finally had everything running with all my software installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed. the aspire wont even boot past the acer screen with a droid i have tried both motorola and htc plugged into the usb port. called tech support and got the usual acer we don t support software but for $$$ we can help you i explained there was no software involved in booting. no tey don t even support their own bios and it could be a problem with the bios how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity needless to say a pc that can t support a cell phone is less than useless with today s company fighting over marketshare its a shame that asus can get away with the inept staff answering thephone. i agree with the previous comment that asus tech support is horrible which is a con in my opinion. summary i ve had this laptop for months out of the blue the power adapter stops working. but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website frustrated i hung up and tried to call back days later to be told that it takes days for turnaround time. this was the day and part still had not been shipped. the rep did not even answer my question i had to ask him if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he didn t even try to acknowledge my question. i m tired of the inept service. if you are looking for a netbook pc do not buy from asus unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can t find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small. i m really frustrated by this experience. how does the power supply not work our apple macbook pro notebook computer notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking. i do everything on this computer check email facebook shop check blogs write papers listen to music and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv. it pretty much does everything we could ever need and looks great to boot. apple is always great about the aesthetics of things they always come up with good looking products. it didn t take me long to get switched over to the mac computer programs and navigation it s been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better. so if you re thinking of a laptop i would heartily recommend theapple macbook pro notebook computer notebook for all your needs it s great and we will always stick with apple computers we have been so happy with them. the macbook pro is portable durable and very capable. it has a hour battery life when you re doing web browsing and word editing making it perfect for the classroom or office and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ll have a battery life of just over hours. it s also very energy efficient running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a watt lightbulb. it s graphics aren t bad at all for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics. the operating system and user interface is very intuitive and the large multitouch track pad is amazing. however the multitouch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you re gaming . still this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work. they also have a longer service life than other computers i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks . probbly the worst decision we ever made it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were. i love the size of the computer since i play games on it. i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have. also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard. so i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer first it does not have a push button to open the lid. it is held in place magnetically. there is a little indent to help open it but good luck with that. once open the leading edge is razor sharp. this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design. using this machine is like a mild form of torture. the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare. i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening. also the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it. i hate to say this but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back then i would. it is absolutely horrible to use despite all its so called advanced features. i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use. it s a bummer and one out of five is being kind. my mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary. in due course i ll remove the hard disc from this new macbook pro and dump it where it belongs in the trash. but the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing. i like this machine because its very lightweight... very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent... hours of battery life is really something else.... i highly recommend that you buy this product. it crashes and when it goes flat it just dies like a pc maybe worse and i loose all my open documents i hate it it is the easiest computer i have ever used i love it i can t say enough good for it it s a mac i fine apple macboook pro notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go. i like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races. it s face and depanable. as a graphic arts a retired instructor i still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art ..... it s just a great toy to have around. very very slow laptop. tons of bloatware and junk programs. can t reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers. keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed. lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small. amazing machine. it is a big big but since it has a screen what would you expect it is truly a desktop replacement. very fast and efficient does a great job with video shot on a canon mkii. very happy with my toshiba laptop the touchpad is very intuitive so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again of course i also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork garageband and imovie. i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets and rather quickly too. i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows on it by using the vmware program. now i have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the mac i also got the added bonus of a hd monitor which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh i never have had a good result with this computer. i was told by many that it was a great computer but we got one of these and it worked great for one year and as soon as the warrenty was up then it got really bad. they told me it was my loss even though it was the computer not what i ve done. the hard drive crashed as well and i had to buy a new power cord. they told me to reprogram the computer and i didn t need to do that and i lost pictures of my oldests first years of her life. i don t like this company nor the toshiba brand and i ll never buy another one because i ve put more into it then it is worth. i would rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a toshiba that isn t good at all. the right speaker did not work. again the same problem the right speaker did not work. i returned the laptop for a full refund. the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i ve ever seen. sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move. the mouse buttons are hard to push. i cant believe hp put this out. do not buy you will be disappointed. i m returning mine dell is a decently made pc. the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side. with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch. so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop. i love hp it s the only computer/printer we will buy. this is perfect for her field. at first when i got this product i loved it. the computer itself was fast ran smoothly and had no problems. then within months the charger crapped out on me. so i called compaq and after being on the phone for hours i finally got a replacement which i shouldn t have had a problem getting since it was under warranty. months later the battery went. they gave me a hard time yet again but their was a malfunction in the battery itself it didn t die. then one month after the warranty expired the replacement charger went. i had to pay for a universal charger for this cheap laptop. not worth it one bit. the people are frustrating to work with the product itself is very cheaply made and the accessories are less than satisfactory. also my sister got the exact same laptop since they were so cheap and after months the screen split in half just from everyday use. apparently under the screen there are little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth they come loose. and it is impossible to get them back in. strengths wellshaped weaknesses a bad videocard after min the screen of the notebook switched off. it was still working but there was nothing on the screen. i was said it s videocard. very disappointed didn t expect to repair it at once don t buy this model. an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will. mine came at w/o a dvd burner . the screen is framed by half to a fullinch margin that is obviously unnecessary reduces the screen size and increases the bulk. the usb ports are nice but the two on the side only work now and then. keyboard could use some trimming. did i mention everything about it from size to weight to keyboard screams bulk i m glad i made the choice to switch and buy this mac. the benefits were immediate awesome graphics the magnetic plugin power charging power cord is great i even put it to the test by accident excellent innovation this laptop rocks only wish it could run solidworks cad which apple doesn t support i ve saved a lot of time and headaches so far using my new macbook pro. i have never had any issues or problems with my macbook pro so far and it is still as fast as it was when i first bought it. i especially like the backlit keyboard. it makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier. it is also very lightweight making transporting this computer very easy. the graphics on this computer are also stellar very clear and vivid. i use iphoto all the time which is a great program for anyone who is into photography amateurs and experts alike. the program came with the computer and works beautifully. i definitely will buy a mac again if and when this computer ever fails. my hp died after only months. it started out getting hot after only a few months. at months it started shutting off after only or minutes. i use a cooling pad but it doesn t help. i took it to the shop and they said it would cost too much to repair it. i will have to say that i love my macbook pro it fires up in the morning in less than seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing. this is now my macbook pro and i really honestly love it the macbook pro is very sturdy and versatile. i love it i even got my teenage son one because of the features that it offers like ichat photobooth garage band and more we are addicted to the mac. this is a great laptop and i would recommend it to anyone. the os takes some getting used to especially after being a windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it great laptop that offers many great features lightweight and the screen is beautiful it is easy to operate and i have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new rolls royce of laptops. buy it love it and i promise you won t regret it. this computer is good for days then it sucks for the rest of your life. you will regret it if you buy any dell. dell sucks the only pro to this computer is it was under everything is falling apart internally and externally. with in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down. i am constantly trying to uninstall programs clean cookies and delete unused files. nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan. more times that not the screen pops up saying i have a bad internet connection or the page can t be displayed. it takes me approximately tries to get to each site then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works. i have vista so i am unable to install and uninstall some programs. i can t even install one of the printers i have in my house so i am unable to print. externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit and the screen has a terrible glare. in short i would never buy a compaq again. i bought this laptop on saturday and am completely in love with it it was super easy to set up and is really easy to get used to. the online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a pc. the performance is awesome. i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my macbook pro was worth every dollar. with all the goodies inside this machine it is a value. it is very well built. the keyboard is top notch. the touch pad is among the best. the screen is huge and coloful but no led backlighting. the video card is great for media and above average for gaming but not a gamers first choice. the problem i had with this unit was unresolvable. it had a cooling system malfunction after minutes of general use and would not move past this error. i acually believe the issue is with the nvidia grafics card but still requires a return. sorry toshiba but impressions do count for something. i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it. so this was great for me. it has just enough ram to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs. plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work. i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems. but i am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it. i look forward to years of use it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well. the difference is the toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space. it s super fast and a great value for the price i would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one. a month later we reinstall the os vista . a coupla months later they change my hard drive. a month or so ago the freaking motherboard just died. went silently. one night i turned the freaking thing off after using it the next day i turn it on no gui screen all dark power light steady hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does. the motherboard is dead and i m still paying the bloody financing for a product which didn t last me at least three years i initially purchased my macbook pro in april and i loved it. i was so happy with my new mac. then the hard drive failed; my information was all lost my fault i know but i never thought i would need to back up my information on a brand new mac the paragon of all computers so after apple replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another months of my new computer until it froze this morningcompletely. i can t even turn it off. it s catatonic. even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it s like new i might have months next time. i would rate this computer at stars but considering it has a short life span i can only give it and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine. great battery speed display. it works my house is now macbook. the macbook starts fast doesn t crash has a fantastic display is small and light i have the model and isn t always complaining about updates lost connections errors blue screens etc. this is what a laptop is supposed to be. i thought the price was great for the specs. but after using it a couple of weeks the overall operation is poor. i hate the display screen and i have done everything i could do the change it. the keyboard is too slick. i really don t like it but i am stuck. dell latitude is not a reliable machine. the battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes. later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months. the machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely. very disappointing i was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain flash. web access through the network is so slow it s very frustrating and very disappointing. after purchasing this thing i find out that i need a special interface device to connect my camera and that it cannot be purchased at the store only on line. hp pavilion notebook pc when i first got this computer it really rocked. but as time went on i found it almost impossible to keep the thing online through wifi. eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on. guess i ll stay away from hp. my macbook is probably the best investment i have ever made. i have had it for almost four years now and i have only had a few problems with it. the most recent being that my safari internet browser is freaking out on me but i have just been using firefox instead. i love this computer. its small enough where i can take it pretty much anywhere but still has a big enough screen to get everything done. the only thing that i don t like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that i want to be able to run and i am not able to. games being the main issue. it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i can t play it because its not compatable with the software. other than that i don t have one complaint in the world this computer periodically crashes office iphoto safari . it takes a long time to get on the web and to change web sites. locks up she searching for updates. it seems that this computer might be a lemon. i purchased my macbook pro retina from my school since i had a student discount but i would gladly purchase it from amazon for full price again if i had too. the retina is great its amazingly fast when it boots up because of the ssd storage and the clarity of the screen is amazing as well. but if you buy this i would highly recommend that you buy a case and screen protector for this machine as they are known to be quite fragile. count me as extremely satisfied it s a perfect computer. i just bought this computer from the apple store and i couldn t be more impressed with it. it has a stunning retina display and is very fast. this computer is good for anything and it has really superseded my high expectations. also the sound quality from the speakers is crystal clear and everything is just sleek and smooth. the hd display is sensational and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me. no hardware issues as is common with any apple product. great product and couldn t be happier with it. awesome laptop i love it i love my new thinkpad it gives me everything i need from a computer and with the long lasting battery it also gives me mobility. i can use it anywhere. it was a great purchase. all the sturdy and substantial feel you expect from a thinkpad. average performance on almost every benchmark but priced accordingly. below average on the wfi adapter which i m still trying to get to the bottom of. great laptop. fast. works very well. would purchase again. a good value for the money. quite pleased with it. fast enough for my purposes. no bloatware from third party parasites to uninstall. excellent keyboard and crisp screen. battery could be better but it has robust processor and plenty of ram so that is a trade off i suppose. i m glad to have it and it showed up in only a few days. the laptop itself is very good it could be better but not bad at all for it s price point. it does everything i need. the big deal with this was windows when i saw this i grabbed it. it has met all my needs. just what i expected. i don t have any complains about this computer outstanding laptop and very well built. the retina display is fantastic. one of the best thing i have bought in years. great pc light and powerful. is just amazing.= the glare of the glossyretina display is unbearable. do not buy a mac until this issue is resolved. performs as advertised if not better super light weight i never cared either way about weight until now . feels like solid state. wonderful machine; glad i bought it. tiny forgivable drawback no ethernet cable outlet. but that s not a dealbreaker. super laptop will probably get another one for my wife a bit ugly but works good i like the design rather sleek and light. i will give advise any prospective buyers this is not great laptop its good for web browsing and word processing fantastic for the price just wish it the keys were illuminated. if your on a budget.... save up longer. this laptop isn t worth a single cent. i couldn t even install linux on it. windows runs very poorly. just save your money and get something better. awesome price for a laptop that lasts more than hours without recharging awesome this laptop is a complete cheap junk. by just looking at it you will realize it s crap. it s not what you pay for. the case is made from cheap plastic. in the description it said there is bluetooth but no there isn t. i m warning you you re wasting your money on this love the computer. hate windows it dosn t even have a disc compartment had to return the computer. keeps freezing no ethernet outlet disc drive will not open or function odd unusual dell commands would have exchanged instantly but had to use as if for college immediately. unimpressed. terrific laptop. works beautifully. great price. just what we needed for our daughter to do her on line math class this is a great home computer. it is very very quiet. the only reason i didn t give it a star is i feel i have to reach so far to type on the key board. you also have to press firmly on the keys. otherwise this is a great computer great prices. was easy to set up and has been easy to learn to use it. works good and is fast enough for me. good product for a good price. it was too cheaply constructed. it also gave me an introduction to windows which i hope will be discontinued it the future. the computer is horrible its to slow. the thing that you insert cds into won t open. not a good computer at all. we returned two days later. they were excellent to handle our return and post our refund back into our account the next day. great price and computer they loved it. it s easy to operate and it s very light my parents are almost yo they can t carry a heavy computer while traveling . but here s something i hadn t realized before buying it there isn t an optical drive which means no cds or dvds this product was doa. fired up and worked for the first day and then the display died on my wife while she was taking a timed test. would not recommend. pretty good laptop. good for basic stuff. don t try to use to play any pc games or anything. just for simple web browsing and media streaming. pretty premium feel for the low price. i have so much trouble turning the computer on. it comes on for seconds then shuts itself off. my mistake was to not research this one no dvd and no place to insert my ad card to download pictures. i should have waited to find a higher quality computer. i m very happy this laptop is beatifull is nt slow at all. but it doesn t have a cd unit anyway the other thing is that the laptop does not have an ethernet port for cable connecting. just wifi.... the screen is big and everything was as described for everyday use you can t really go wrong with this laptop. if like me you will be paying bills occasionally reading the news or just buying stuff on line then this is a winner. if you are a gamer or need it for heavy computer use get something else. it s a good starter computer that is extremely light on the wallet. like i said good for basic stuff and as a starter. still getting use to window has a built in camera which i do not use. sturdy but only for typical wear and tear. can not believe the price amazing computer perfect for school. i ve had my lenovo for a little over a month now and it does everything i want it to do and more. i really have nothing negative to say about it. the keyboard is a little wonky with having to use the function button to get the fkeys but with how infrequently i use those it is a nonissue. it is a great value for what you get. i can run somewhat modern games like skyrim and fallout new vegas with no issues. i get giddy every time i use this thing. it is a thing of beauty and fast enough. when you click and don t wait. so yes it is ridiculously fast. the battery will get you from la to ny no problem. the different than my other computer so we have to get use to it. it is very light and the picture is nice and the price was amazing. can even readmy kindle on this computer excellent item shipped on time met my expectations it doesnt heat at all dont use it for gaming for the price this is a super product out of the box. it wont wow you with its speed but who can complain at plus this computer comes with a full size keyboard. no junkware this computer is great for someone who is looking to manage their online life banling facebook etc and some basic offline work using ms office. the only drawback is no dvd player.. but for you can buy an external one very light and beautiful. it s just a little slow. five starts terribly slow... start up time took forever everything runs very slowly. screen broke month outside warranty. overall build quality is cheap. avoid acer. not bad. nice and light seems to help your work instead of becoming work itself. perfect size for me. probably not a gaming machine which i have zero interest in. i just love this ultrabook i defenitly recommend it for anyone for office and home work it s ok. i find that it often gets very slow and i have to restart more than usual. it s light and easy to use though. i love this computer this is my first ever mac i m and it took a little while to switch over from the os i was used to but it was a fast learning curve. the resolution is gorgeous the computer is light it does everything i need and the interface is pretty intuitive. i love this computer however i am very upset that it doesn t have the superdrive built in supper east to use. retina display is beautiful. also very quick laptop con hate that it has no disk drive. i am also glad it doesnt get too hot when left on for an extended period of time. the battery life is good even with using high profile software like sibelius for a good half of the day. wonderful super fast lightweight computer the new macbook pro working good user experience fast speed faster start up time. this is what i was looking for. it has a wide screen and it s easy to use. at my age i need this kind of laptop. extremely slow. a masterpiece of crap. not durable . slow processor just not it i can t use the trackpad very well it s too sensitive so i hooked up a mouse. external monitor worked easily. been using lenovo thinkpad edge laptops in our business for several years now and have no complaints about any of them. they have held up well not just in our sales department but also in our service department where they are exposed to dust exhaust grease oil and all manner of other noncomputerfriendly substances. general a quality laptop. the lenovo software that comes preinstalled may qualify as bloatware but is easily removed if you re not interested in it. windows rocks. computer runs very slow great laptop bigger screen than expected laptop with a desktop design that is really nice to use for all types of usage including programming/editing one of the very few laptops still available with win pro multiple usb ports and a dvd read/write drive. only drawback is no led to show when the hard drive is being accessed. not a necessity but something i ve come to expect. does what i need it to do and the price was right great laptop from apple apple is unrivaled in terms of build quality and functionality. the retina screen is absolutely beautiful and the touchpad is the best touchpad to date. the pair allow for seamless navigation throughout the whole interface. battery life is astonishing given the processing power and high resolution display. i can easily get hours out of a full charge. overall a high quality laptop and a great value considering all this computer has to offer. well worth the extra cost. size is perfect and display is beautiful excellent performance especially given its price point. the screen is wide and provides excellent clarity. it is not a small compact laptop but i won t be traveling via air often so its size and weight is not a problem for me. i can appreciate why she recommended it don t expect much in terms of performance from this laptop. it gets the job done in terms of having a computer that can browse the web use word/excel and the like. this laptop does not have an ethernet adapter for wired network connection. fast easy so far i do not have any trouble with it other than the picture quality is a bit poor. i have had it over a month now and it works just fine. this laptop suits my needs as i am currently studying online and just need a computer for that purpose. my daughter uses it for college too and it works great for both of us. so i gave this stars but only because of the poor picture quality other than that it is a great buy this laptop is absolutely horrible. i bought it simply for excel on windows for work since i have a macbook air and literally the thing freezes and lags opening excel or my web browser. there is a chance mine is defective but regardless i m not going to try another one this is a terrible product. i d much rather bite the bullet and spend a little more for a product that actually meets minimum computing expectations for i appreciate the effort to hit affordable pricing dell but just not worth it. it is slow and complicated and very disappointing great labtop.. not as fast as i would have liked it to be but everything else is great i ve only had this computer for a few days an i already don t like it. the battery life is a joke and it s causing other problems. i will be returning it. if people are writing bad reviews about this laptop then believe what they say. this is an ok computer. the processor shows a speed of the sound is disappointing. no bass sound at all. maybe this one is just a dud. the computer is very wonderful. was not aware it did not have a disk drive when i bought it or i would not of purchased it. it does have a habit of restarting itself when you try to do the log in pw. but over all. im very satisfied. its very fast and very light. great product. i am giviing it four stars instead of five because of no disk drive and the crashing i absolutely love my dell inspiron it powers on/off very quickly and it loads up automatically. the mouse click is a bit loud but it really isn t a problem. for i highly recommend very poor quality lap top.... i am returning it... slow great value laptop i can t believe this was just speed is great easy to set up and get going. very pleased so far. it is very difficult to use this computer. too many steps to get anywhere and hard to set up this things run smoothly for its price and the battery life seems to go on forever. i wasn t disappointed in its performance. all in all it s well worth its price tag. great laptop for the price. it was nearly impossible to find a laptop that had a a side keyboard. b a dvd/cd player. c a large hard drive instead of using the cloud d was under with shipping. the only con is windows effin still giving it a star rating because it is fast and a nice sized screen. great for web design and general work. overall good but processing power isn t very good. pro with pro upgrade is nice but it frequently freezes for a few seconds here and there. i replaced stock drive with wd black drive and is still quite slow. battery doesn t last long web browsing hours maybe . it has some bloat wear that i wish weren t there. it works fine for a pc in this price range. i bought it for my parents late and they love it particularly the keyboard and screen. terrific value for the money. love the key layout and the builtin mouse pad all work well and are properly sized. highly recommended. works good but doesn t seem like it s made sturdy. kinda to light and plastic feeling. killer computer. i would highly recommend this computer it is fast doesn t have touch screen but i have a tablet so that wasn t so important. look and feel is good. i am experiencing the system little slower than what i have expected. and processor feels pressured even though i run medium scale programs watching the way exhaust speed increases. the hdd has a scratching noise. the system sometimes lags a lot. i don t like it at all... i can t put a protector to make presentation... a good value on a quality product. easy setup and delivers all the functions we need. this laptop is amazing despite the fact that there s no optical drive everything is perfect. the screen resolution is crystal clear the speakers are amazing and the track pad is easy to use. the home page/startup is easy to navigate which is the one thing i was mainly concerned about. internet is fast and reliable battery life lasts a long time. i love this laptop looks like this dell is a piece of crap. it does not turn on if i take the battery out it might work not sure if it s a bad battery or computer do not recommend awesome laptop bootup time is amazing battery life is decent and it has a great slim form factor. there is somewhat of a learning curve but the operating system and hardware of this mac are great. more than enough for my use. the display is vibrant and clear the keyboard is well designed and pleasant to type on; i even installed a windows partition to be able to run windows software. things just work they are fluid easy to use and understand fast and work well. this computer is absolutely perfect for web browsing watching video word processing and that s about it. if you want a computer that plays games or any advanced tasks like editing video this computer is not for you. now when i say don t expect to play games on it i mean it. pretty much every major game save for solitare won t even play on it due to the slower processor. its also worth noting that there no bluetooth no mircophone jack no ethernet no dvd/cd drive/burner and no usb ports. it does come with two usb ports a hdmi port and a webcam. the webcam is nothing special its there if you need it. don t expect it to take good pictures or video. the battery is pretty soild. it lasts up to hours with normal use. the computer itself runs very quiet and is mostly cool to the touch. the only major negative to me is windows though ymmv and the dell crapware installed. not bad for the price. i needed an inexpensive laptop to do basic office work on that was lightweight and this fits the bill just fine. performance wise it s a bit slow but that s to be expected from a celeronclass processor. i m also not a fan of windows but fortunately i can install whatever i want on the laptop without issue. love everything about this laptop sound quality and touchscreen are awesome i would definitely recommend this i love this laptop to the moon. my favorite colors black and red the matte material and the red backlight of the keyboard. the sound is great and it s fast. the laptop is beautiful not extremely light but thin enough and wide screen with a full keyboard. the touch screen response is fast and it picks up bluetooth and wifi fast. microsoft office is a day trial a number of games and apps are already preloaded. it s exactly like the picture and i am satisfied. great laptop light and very versatile it was easy to set up. i like the number pad for work so that s nice this is going to be random and unorganized but here are my thoughts on the laptop so far so good after a month. it took some getting used to on the widows after being an xp user for many years. everything seems to be running smoothly. only downfall is the preloaded mcafee and other software. they are fine while the free subscription is going but a pain when they start asking you to spend money every time you login. device is light weight quiet during operation and produces little to no heat. it has a quick start up and shut down time. the display is good quality. just wish there were more usb ports. i am impressed with this computer inexpensive but quality. love the size i am using this for work i am a nurse and have to chart daily this is easy to use and i have not had any problems with it. it s so damn good i bought d if you re the type of person that just likes to browse the internet and enjoy media and do light work with microsoft office this is the laptop for you. don t expect it to be a champion performer so if you want to play games or whatever this is not the computer for you. it s extremely light weight and slim because of the lack of an optical drive who uses those anymore anyways so it easily fits into any college students bag. i would recommend this to anyone who doesn t need much out of a computer. i am very happy with this computer. it is exactly what i expected and the price is excellent you are getting what you pay for and in my opinion it is worth more. been using it for about hours now and it seems plenty fast and does everything i need it to do. its a very basic laptop. i thought it would have a cdrom drive but there isnt one. also wish it had a port to plug an internet cord into it because sometimes my wifi router likes to not work. but for the price its good. other than the slow cpu it works great for everyday use. heavy gaming is definitely not it s strong point. the cover is a soft rubber texture without the friction. slick design and looks great. the machine is easy to use has the power it needs for personal use and some light professional work. it could be lighter but couldn t everything. the battery seems adequate for most uses ~ hour use/charge. screen is clear and bright. glad it has the dvd drive. perfectly adequate. great pc. the is incredibly fast the ram makes it proper for several games not on maximum quality . great sound quality too. nice laptop. i use it for school its quick and has everything i need on it. good battery life as well. wifi card not working right out of the box. dealing with hp support is a ridiculous and painful experience. i have spent more than hours on the phone with them over different calls only to get no where. now i m looking into the return process which i m sure will just be loads of fun if my prior experience is any indication. seriously save yourself the hassle and purchase from a different company. used to love hp products but this has soured me on the whole company. by far the best laptop i ve ever had. its fast powerful screen display is top notch and the battery life is excellent for a laptop of this size. my only concern is that since the battery is not external i will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time. i wonder if thats just apples way of saying its time to get the newest and greatest laptop years from now lol. the product is average and works well. works at a decent speed. the mouse pad however is very loud which is why i gave it four stars. i had a great experience purchasing my dell inspiron laptop. my laptop was easy to setup and i ve had no problems to date. did not disappoint me at all. lenovo is the best laptop. built in mike is really poor and unusable for skype or any other purpose. and the only microphone input is for a combo mike/speaker plug. so to communicate i need to wear ear plugs or a headset with a builtin mike. that s a nuisance for family skype calls...only one can speak at a time. we haven t used it enough or had it long enough to give it stars but so far it has been a very good laptop. several other reviewers made comments on the keyboard and now i can understand why this keyboard is the nicest to use of any laptop we ve ever owned. i m a lifelong desktop computer user and the keyboard on this laptop is as close to a normal keyboard as i ve ever seen. we like this new laptop a lot very good performer for the price. not blazing fast but quick enough. one really nice thing about lenovo laptops is that they are not cluttered with a bunch or trial software. the desktop was clean once i got it up and running. battery life is above average and it charges quickly. keyboard is sturdy. the touch pad takes a little getting used to as the click buttons are on top instead of the bottom. i will be considering lenovo for all future laptop purchases. this lap top is good so far. it is quiet runs smoothly. i really like the video option on it i stream movies on amazon prime and netflix and there is no lag. the only negative would be that it gets pretty warm sitting on my lap for very long but that is pretty much standard for all lop tops i think. it stopped working days after purchase. it was slow and might be problematic. i would shop around for a better one. crashed only days from getting it says it is failing hard drive. i should have bought something better. the pc is works well with a good battery and a power cable and has a web cam. however it does not have a dvd drive neither does it afford one the opportunity to connect an external dvd drive as the manufacturer did not make any point ofconnection of an external drive. other than a hate of windows she just loves it. the plastic materials are rather cheap. love it needs more instructions with it i m very happy with my acer it does just for what i need it. even the sound is fantastic i love this laptop. even my extremely tech savvy boyfriend was impressed with the features and sleek design. although i ve had it for less than a week i am very satisfied. functions well. does all that was advertised. if it had a star option that is what i would give. the build is perfect the screen fantastic but i do have a bit of a problem with the fact that i have to buy adaptors for nearly everything from vga cables to ethernet cables so almost perfect... display. love the color accuracy. decent speakers. fast. fan when watching video off youtube. sounds like a washer. machine gets fairly hot near the bottom of the screen. battery power laptop had difficulties computing. feels too heavy to me. could lose another pound or two. paid close to out the door. biggest piece of junk i have ever purchased. this clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered. it would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for minutes. the second one after a little over a month refused to turn on even with a full charge. what a lemon this is a big disappointment. i only use a laptop for personal use but this one can t even handle that it takes a long time to load any page. i ve had it for a minth and so far it s shut down completely times. i have had dell desktops for years so had no qualms about buying a dell laptop. never again. i ve always sworn by dell. so with this new order all the upgrades and windows really caught my eye and i got this for the long haul. i am not ultra tech savvy but i can tell when it works slow i barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load. i m so disappointed. in two months both the power cord pin broke the company replaced it and then the cd drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into a million pieces. in addition no matter what i do to change the settings add/delete flash etc. firefox hangs on startup. it seems like lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on. the cords always feel like they are in my way. one positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard which is larger than usual. it s a pleasure to type on. my final thoughts if you are a mac user stay away. if you want to travel with this laptop don t buy it. it s clunky heavy and a pain to start up and shut down. great for games it s truly a great laptop for the price. however this laptop far exceeded my expectations when i bought it for college i only use malwarebytes and microsoft security essentials run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years. for which is as much as my graphics card alone cost this laptop is an incredible value. it is quite impressive at multitasking which really surprised me. i can have tabs open while playing youtube videos and it handles it impressively well. but i should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen it s certainly good enough for the average person but if you re used to good screens this may bother you a bit but it s certainly not unbearable by anyone s standards. if you want to game this thing can handle league of legends on mediumlow settings but i certainly wouldn t recommend it for gaming. overall a great laptop for simply doing basic things and webbrowsing. would definitely recommend for those who are technologically ignorant this computer is very slow i love this laptop it does everything i need it too very good price. very nice computer immediately didn t like the track buttons. they are loud and clunky but i figured i d get used to it. the laptop died two days after i received it. i purchased a dell inspiron and so far i love it this model has a true life monitor which is worth the extra bucks. if you re looking for a basic pc this is the way to go. the hinges on this pc are nice and tight and well made like the rest of the pc. i was surprised at the overall quality and the price in all my life i have never come across a computer as slow as this one it cant perform basic operations and is practically useless. i just received the laptop and if it runs like this already cant imagine how it would work in the next couple of weeks. it took almost minutes to boot up. please people dont make the same mistake i did. this is a complete waste of money dont let the price fool you would be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly. it was not responsive at all to touch. and while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse. if they can fix this i think it would be a very nice costeffective laptop. this laptop broke within the first hour of use. the a key became jammed so that sometimes it wouldn t press in. dell claims they test each key with thousands of mechanical key strokes. also after restarting the laptop it constantly made high pitched electronic noises. i m sure i just got a bad egg but instead of getting a replacement i decided to try a different one. this laptop is nice. it has a decent feel to it sharp display and is fast enough. the biggest problem i have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive. i have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available but nothing has helped. also the touchpad is almost sticky which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad. i would love to keep this laptop but will be sending it back and looking for a different brand. no lenovo for me. initially i liked the product so much. although it was slow but i felt it was ok for the price you have bought it. but now i am having battery problems. laptop automatically shuts down when battery life reaches . i am not satisfied with the product. it s an amazing laptop. most of the things about the laptop is awesome except the touchpad. the laptop is fast. the windows used to boot in just and that was freaking awesome. now i have dual booted my laptop to windows and ubuntu and it s not got too slow either. i am loving it completely. it does make a little noise but that s alright as it s not too much. it doesn t get heated up much even after continuous usage. but the touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever i am typing my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it s really annoying. i prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else. a smaller touchpad would make life easier for computer science students or it people much more easier. uhhhhhh the computer looks good. but it works really slowwwwww it has got me feel like to take years to successfully open a web page. purchased it for my birthday and love it i m so glad that i have. it s been a very easy transition moving my windows created files over to the mac. so far i haven t lost any quality or information. i have a little bit of a learning curve with the keyboard shortcuts. but other than that i really am loving the quality and speed. expensive but worth it. the display has a great resolution but have difficulty always seeing the small print. haven t quite figured out how to make the font size larger overall. this is without a doubt the worst laptop i ve ever had. and of course the return window closed last week so now i m stuck with it. i will never buy another lenovo anything unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop don t buy this. the touchpad hasn t worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning i thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads i ve worked with have some inherent oddities. this one however is now very loose and i have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work then suddenly i can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own. today it hasn t worked at all more than it has. it hangs freezes and just isn t working properly. i have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open though i don t have much installed i only have of the left i have no idea what s taking up all the room it doesn t make sense. i could go on and on but suffice it to say if you want to spend on a laptop don t buy this one it s definitely not worth the money. very fast and good for most steam games. don t expect great graphics though. the keyboard and sound are great and the matte screen works well. can run cs go at fps on low settings. computer was doa. turned it on and it was beeping. i love this laptop. looks good well built and very good speed. needed a usb adapt. for network plug no problem. keyboard is nice and windows is great worried about that coming from xp. price makes this the laptop i was looking for. so far i am very happy with this computer. it has everything i wanted built in wifi connectibility a slot for my sd camera memory card a dvd burner big beautiful screen plenty of usb ports three and one and a keyboard with a nice touch. i liked the fact that it came with windows but also included windows to install later if i need it. the price was good. i use a wireless mouse but the touch pad and the red button in the middle that works like a little joystick also work fine. i wish i had bought this sooner this is a great bargain. yes it s running and old type processor so hey don t even try gaming on it. but if you are just an average user it works really great. the screen is good the whole things is very light and doesn t run hot. i m very happy with it typing on it right now and it is fast enough for that i like everything about this laptop. it has no way of connecting to the internet save wifi but that s all i use anyway i put that free app on for word processing and it works like a charm. i plugged it into my existing printers and it just worked no fuss no muss. it immediately recognized the printer and was ready to go. excellent buy. the worst computer i have ever laid my eyes upon. firstly it has no leds to let you know what is going on no cap lock no hard drive indicator nothing. ok one light to let you know if the damn thing is on. the biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it even when the strength bar is filled. also when you try to download a large file like a video it will start out normally downloading at around and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless. too often i would find it not being able to stay connected to the internet. i was unable to download itunes to it. dell support was awful to deal with. and the settings are simply annoying. just not for me. the computer is as expected and worth the money. the windows is a major disappointment. operating a non touch screen on this system is a royal pain it came with no instruction book no back up cd s and has already crashed. hands down one of my best and most used purchases thus far. the macbook pro does no disappoint... retina screen solid build quality weight fast processor and the reliability of the apple brand. cons honestly zero con s ... as a windows pc user the switch over was seamlessly i run parallel when i need windows. all my devices work flawlessly. i m an amature so this does more than i can handle. i m perfectly satisfied just have to get use to the new system i can t see a problem. i fine now and happy as a bug. the price is great and it does everything i want to do thanks. it s perfect it s great for what he uses it for. i am really not happy with this computer... i don t like windows but that is no fault of the computer but the keyboard is so hard to get the keys to work and the space bar. would not buy it again. meh...but cheap. the first thing i can say for positive is that the laptop is very light makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus. now the graphics are not hd...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic medium low grade plastic. so if you don t have kids or not in high school or don t accidently sit on it it should be fine. now the speed is disappointing. start up is fine maybe secs at most but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times. even for a ram it barely chugs with tabs open. all in all i wish i had waited a bit. this laptop is amazing windows has its pros and cons. the keyboard is backlit but you have to press the key to turn it on. of course this will decrease your battery life. the sound is very nice and crisp. also i have no regrets about going with the ram because its super fast. i m still exploring the various features but overall i am satisfied with my purchase. the hp envy has been everything i expected. after doing much research for a laptop that had all the features i was looking for this one hit all the criteria i had. the laptop is very responsice with the core processor and of ram and the sound out of the beats audio is great. i would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a top performing laptop. used times black screen returned for refund do not use the facial recognition windows is not supported by a lot of things the dell is quick enough sturdy not good with finger prints. it does what it advertises. price is great wish it didn t have windows but that is an opinion. i would recommend it for anybody needing a reliable simple laptop. i bought this for my daughter to use for school and homework it s not a fast computer but it s great for what she needs it for and very light weight love the price too well my first apple computer and i am impressed. works well fast and no reboots. glad i did so far. s.... l .... o..... w.... rea......llllyy slow. like seriously really slow. impossible to use. cant even read properly. plus no russian input wtf what a great laptop i can run my games and work really fast. really light you can carry with you everywhere. great battery life. everything at a very great price. i completely recommend it. excellent value and a must buy for someone looking for a macbook. you can t get any better than this price and it come with an internal disk drive. plus you get which is also a great feature. also the resale value on this will keep. i highly recommend you get one before they are gone. got this on black friday with a very good discount and couldn t be happier. the screen is great i don t see the need for a retina display. i also really like the addition of the sd card slot. this macbook pro is amazing if you are afraid of it not having a disc player please don t be. i love the new high retina display and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter. overall this is a fast light practical computer and i highly recommend it. i bought my macbook pro in october of and years later it still works as flawless as ever i ve never had any problems with the computer itself the macbook charger chords are another story though . i tried not to jump on the apple bandwagon but... you re just living in denial if you don t. happy buying bought this laptop from best buy in january still loving it. i can use it as a tablet as a laptop as whatever i want to i play sims and on it all the time with very little issues. the thing wakes up super fast and is always ready to go. music/videos sound great and look great. i use it everyday. my favorite computer i ve ever had this computer overall is great it runs fast ships fast etc. but the company and seller lied to you and try to make an extra buck i bought this pc to play games and stream movies it could handle all of that but my friend wanted me to put some music on a cd i could see the disk drive on the side but it didn t seem to have a button on it a disk drive with buttons on it and he said&quot; this computer does not have a disk drive and i was furious so beware buyer this computer has a useless piece of plastic on it. thank you asus. they don t deserve to be capitalized great computer. very great apple product as expected. good battery life. great color on screen. good speakers from laptop computer. my new laptop is great. it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp. i have to admit that the operating system is different and does take time to learn but i like it. i would recommend it to anyone. this laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing. the speakers are fairly basic so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies. the touchpad is a little &quot;clunky&quot; for my taste; i use a small external mouse with laptops in any event. i appreciate the relatively large keyboard with number pad and screen size. i also found the track pad irritating until i disabled &quot;pinch zoom.&quot; this is larger laptop but is not too heavy. battery life is great though it is new. overall a solid laptop for its price. however a few things are immediately occurring to me i had read the other reviews here on amazon but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead. well my first impressions are that its ok it certainly boots up quickly thanks ssd and from the limited use so far no games its fast enough in normal usage. it certainly looks nice but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out. also i have found the touch pad to be awkward to use could be i am pressing too hard perhaps and the screen is well underwhelming. to be honest i am a little disappointed and considering returning it. this is a horrible laptop. within a day of usage it already slowed down significantly virus entered the system right away. it s heavy. i regretted immediately. nothing like the description says. my apple mac book pro has crashed three times since i purchased it. each time apple can only uninstall to original factory settings for me to start over. i believe this macbook pro was a lemon right out the gate. this computer is like... i m lost for words. this is the best switch i have ever done. this has much more memory and ram memory. even the battery life is like wow i love love loooove i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied. it contains a long battery life incredible specs and an overall enjoyable performance. upgrading from a toshiba laptop i am fully impressed with all of the benefits that the mac operating system provides. the snappy processor allows for me to quickly upload photos and videos as well as create movies for me and my colleagues to enjoy. in upgrading to this computer i can say i have found little to any flaws in the product hence the star review. love this computer. it has done everything and more that i expected. i am sure it will be able to do all i need it to do in the future as well. the screen looks great in my opinion the sound is nice. so far i have no complaints and dont expect many complaints in the future. this did give some set trouble and i had to call tech support. they were great. its been easy breezy since then. how could you not love a mac so far so good i have not encountered any issues with this computer. love the flip feature and the touch screen feature. for the price that i paid i feel that i got good value. this lap top is not the lightest you can purchase so if that is important to you maybe you should shop some more. to a prospective buyer once you go mac you ll never go back. was the best decision we ever made. it runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems we don t have to defrag deliete cookies run security programs or any of the common pc problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed. you can t get a virus on mac so in the long run the cost of the mac is saved by not buying security and not having to replace your computer every year or two. never had any issues no frustrations just great easy wireless all in one fun it s great. because it is a touch screen you don t even need a mouse. you will probably never use it in tablet mode but it s nice to know you have that option. if you draw on the other hand i m sure you will love using this in tablet mode. lastly because it can flip you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard. this computer is great. i have a gb ssd and gb of ram in it which i installed myself. it runs faster than it did when i got it. i enjoy the simplicity and userfriendly interface of yosemite. i m excited for el capitan. the apps are very easy to use. the resolution is excellent. i am very satisfied with everything about this machine. like so many others who do this there is a learning curve and i m excited to do it. this mbp is clean neat and simple. i like that. it takes less time to power up and if you just close the case it go into sleep mode. when you open it wakes up almost immediately. very nice. i am pleased with my decision however i have only had this for a few weeks. there are a few things i am dissappointed with though. only usb ports. no hdmi port. the headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone. not a big deal for me but if you skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a mac. as a student majoring computer science i really fell in love with this laptop. it s inches which for me is not too big nor too small. it has the latest cpu with a gtx for gpu which makes this laptop blazing fast boots up in under seconds with the help of the ssd of course . it has ssd which is just enough for my os games documents and anything in between. it also has an extra bay for an extra hdd if you wish to add one. it s not touchscreen its keyboard is nicely arranged silent and backlit which is nice but what i don t like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers. i have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good. this laptop is so silent its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load thanks to the generation intel core which draws less power thus less heat. it can run games really well. well not really well. mobas like dota and smite can be run on max quality settings with fps or more. medium settings on titles like tomb raider for it to be acceptable fps is the minimum acceptable fps #pcmasterrace . it s lightweight and easy to carry around. the screen is a matte display which is nice but with poor viewing angle. i find myself adjusting it regularly. it looks sleek and gorgeous. blends in with any accessory you use with it. all in all i am very happy with this purchase. and with this price i don t think you can buy anything better. all i can say is i am impressed. very quick to get it up and running with a minimum setup time right after you open the box. it s worth it. pay me now pay me later.........i am happy with my choice going with this laptop. i was disappointed. it seemed like a great computer and a great deal. the first one arrived and it did not work. the space bar sticks. i find it hard to navigate from screen to screen. for a noncomputer savvy person it was very disappointing. i like the inch macbooks. its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable. the new mac os mountain lion has some nice features as wel as the trackpad. i didn t think i would need an optical drive but since i have had it i used it several times. the magnetic lid and charger is cool and battery indicator on the side is cool. the mac is light and so compact i thought i would regret not buying a retina display not in the least the mac pro works just fine. the os is easy and offers all kinds of surprises. i ve been using apple s since and this is the fastest and best one i ve had. this mac allows all of that. this is very fast high performance computer. this should be more than enough computer for almost everyone. i would not hesitate recommending this to anyone. it fast and easy to set up. i had cloned my data from my old computer using carbon copy cloner ccc and simply moved everything to the new computer and was off and running at speeds i had only dreamed up before. the mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized lazy and eye candy person in all of us. the macbook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like a friendly guide. if you want to use the internet then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon. this computer is amazing for the individual who does not want to do any extra work via their understanding of their laptop. i would ve given stars had it not been for the hours of updates i ve had to do to this upon arrival. other than that i love it. it s portable reliable and great for what i use it for. positives no matter what position this laptop will stay in it. it s very sturdy. quick bootup and runs efficiently. touchscreen is great. negatives as aforementioned my only con was the updates. everything you d expect from a mac. it looks and feels solid with a flawless finish. the screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down. only had it a few weeks but doesn t leave my side. this machine is flawless fast and classy. out of all the laptops i have owned this is by far the best i m not sure if it was covered in the description but it does have a backlit keyboard and i m getting about an hour battery life on one charge except i don t use this for games or videos which obviously would drain the battery faster . it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid. the screen has an extremely high resolution that i m very pleased with. even though macbooks are expensive you will see that they are well worth the money. you will not regret buying this computer my daughter s macbook air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago. it took days to make an appointment at the local apple store. i m not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand for a new battery to replace it and for a new keyboard. i could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so i went to the apple store myself and asked for a manager. he explained to me the battery expansion is normal . apple doesn t cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their apple care. the battery is simply considered consumable and not covered. i asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the macbook air on the internet with the description that apple doesn t consider the product defective. his reply astonished me looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said make sure you have your facts straight before you smear he didn t specify who are they but from the tone of his voice and his posture it indicated something between the swat team and a bunch of lawyers. here is my take on all of this the business model apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from china hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school call them geniuses and bully everybody who complains about their product. steve jobs is dead so is apple. no more apple devices in my household. please google macbook battery bulge explode before you buy your next apple toy. i ve been spoiled by the build quality and stability of macintosh and even this used computer is a gem. i can bat around all the things that everyone else says but it s been what we ve been using for decades and i have nothing bad to say. it churns out hd content runs without many flaws and i ve yet to get a virus on a mac since i started using the platform in the early s. my macbook s motherboard fried but i think that was a sugar spill that i never bothered cleaning up. that s the only issue i ve ever had since working on macs in that s a pretty impressive track record don t you think however the hp envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more. i have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all. while the price may seem high it is worth every penny with its many perks. the pros a ton of storage space this laptop comes with of memory and a tb hard drive. that is plenty of space for your laptop which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers. capability the ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus. if you are looking to get a laptop this is the laptop you should consider. i love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies without having the keyboard in the way of things. i find it much easier to type on and much more durable. battery life my battery life is really good with this laptop and i have had no problems with it thus far. i can usually go about hours before i get down to battery life. the cons no disc drive call me old fashioned but i still enjoy listening to physical cds and uploading them to itunes. however i can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive. overall i definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop. the touchscreen and capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes. it also is nice to be able to play candy crush or angry birds when in between classes straight from your laptop. it makes it much more exciting to play i m actually writing this review on my new macbook and i love it the computer it self is amazing. it is an older model so know that upfront but it is everything i was looking for. from the moment i received this macbook it was like a dream come true. i know once i upgrade the ram to it will pick up a lot. also if after reading some reviews and doing some research i found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus. so long story short if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop. i know people were complaining that it isn t the newest model but it all depends on what you are looking for. i highly recommend this computer is a fantastic tool for word processing searching the internet and keeping track of everyday life. it s also incredibly light has a battery that can last for days and looks like a piece of art. though that s pretty much what your paying for a well designed device. when you look at the internal specs the computer is only worth about it has a gb storage capacity but with the option of a gb hard drive and a dualcore intel core so don t expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too. if your looking to be a trendy hipster who can t live without a mac it s a great buy. it mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don t need. pros nice looks. keyboard is great i wanted a simple full hd display and this one does its job sound is great and this has a extra slot for hdd no cd drive. cons web cam. vga really asus you don t want to show this to anyone . anyway i don t use webcam much so i don t care viewing angles are not great. remember its a dual core. the fan kicks in even its not too hot. i found the track pad not great. i use my mouse so not a problem for me. over all very good system and worth it. this was the only tabletstyle computer so far which met my requirements. i was seduced by this computer so i took it home. the wireless keyboard not bluetooth but rf did not pair up with the device. it still did not pair. i even ran it as administrator still no effect. i used the ctrlesc keys while turning on and still nothing. it flickers briefly to green before the light goes out. i still can t pair it. i don t want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional. sony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while i get my money back for a defective product. but sony doesn t seem to have addressed it. my first mac computer and as many before me i just fall in love with it. changed the memory from gb to gb corsair vengeance and gb hdd rpm with seagate hybride gb hdd ssd. machine is flying and with parallels desktop i have my old pc notebook completely functional on my mbp. way to go and enjoy both worlds. this asus you re looking at right here and that i m typing on right now has one. with that being said for the price you get a nice fast laptop but if you ask me it s missing some things that i feel should be automatically included this laptop has no touchscreen optical drives ok a bit of a stretch because that would eat up precious space in this monster swivel or detachable screen what this laptop does have is windows which is confusing as all getout tons of this is really nice but i hate the awkward right mouse clicking.. sometimes it works sometimes it doesn t.. may be the laptop may be the laptop in conjunction with windows either way highly annoying. i hooked up a usb mouse and all is well. all works beautifully but windows is taking a bit of getting used to. love the degree rotation and the touch screen works great but a little bit of a learning curve there too as sometimes i have to tap a few times to get the exact location i need... overall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop the mouse was the only negative i could really see ... this is a fantastic transformer i loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows platform. the only reason i returned it was because i bought it to use the touchscreen with photoshop and because of the program it could not utilize the touchscreen within the work space except to zoom and rotate. i would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase. it s a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen. i m looking forward to needing a laptop update so i can purchase this computer again. i ve only had this for a week overall i like the computer it s thin &amp; light and the wireless keyboard works great. i was impressed; sony puts in small touches like a usb charging port on the charger. one thing i did t like is the stylus holder it s cheap plastic and doesn t seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the usb port. i do t use it i think i would accidently break it and loose my stylus. the other issue i had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it. awesome laptop for college can be used for gaming as well. it s light fast and has great battery it s a steal when considering the specs and performance as well. the processor and gpu are fantastic at running games and multiple apps. i can run most games to a good quality without seeing any lack of speed. the backlit keyboard is a nice touch especially. make sure to only handle this computer with clean hands because the front cover can get oily pretty fast. i m overall very pleased with my new laptop the only downside are the speakers. they don t go very loud at all. the quality of the sound is nice but the lack of volume really kills it for me. this is mostly not an issue since i mainly use earbuds anyways however it could be annoying at times. the screen looked fine to me and wasn t an issue like others have been saying. overall great for me this laptop has delivered. i immediately did the windows upgrade and haven t had any issues. the wireless adapter is strong and the ssd is fast. this thing boots in just a few seconds which is nice. others have mentioned issues with viewing angle on the screen but i never use the laptop where i m not looking straight at it so it doesn t bother me. i m very pleased with the purchase. boot time is super fast around anywhere from seconds to minute. apps launch super fast and the hdd is more than sufficient. i usually use my mac for school work and internet browsing so the entrylevel macbook pro is already more than what i expected from a computer i would typically use it for. macs hardly ever get viruses and they are completely incompatible with existing microsoft windows viruses. furthermore mac os x mountain lion s gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed. the keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are backlit which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing typing . overall the screen resolution though nonretina is sufficient for normal web browsing and work. the thunderbolt port is awesome us comes with the mbp and has transfer rates of up to other ports include firewire gigabit ethernet magsafe port microphone jack. sdhc card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs. the glass track pad is large enough for apple s highly acclaimed multitouch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers. for windows users switching to a mac you can also enable right clicking known to apple as secondary click in the system preferences&gt; mouse and enabling right clicking. the unique to apple aluminium unibody is a real beauty. it makes the mbp very durable and protects it from scratches though you shouldn t go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it. the mac app store and itunes store are phenomenal. the mac app store is your onestop shop for mac software though you can also download software online at your own risk. there are currently around apps on the app store and counting... and billions of songs available for download fro the itunes store. itunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it s simple to use user interface. i m sure you won t regret making this purchase. one of the worst pieces of electronics i have ever bought. very pour performance. it takes for ever to wake it up. sometimes it stops receiving wifi signal so i have to restart it. it is very slow and not responsive. would not recommend. glare is also pretty frustrating. there is definitely more to say... i tested it it worked great. he received it and one day later it dies. the laptop refuses to start we have troubleshooted all areas still fails to start. cannot even get to bios. just a click and a black screen. of course it dies days past the return window. we got two days of operation from this laptop. when the macbook pro arrived i helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the pc to the mac... an easy draganddrop process utilizing a flash drive. it was delivered with of ram on each of two sticks which was probably adequate. so i simply pulled one stick from the machine and installed the stick in its place. the machine now has gigs of ram and it works just fine. but hey it s an apple. i wouldn t expect anything less if it was possible to give them start i would have done it. my laptop s one of the key from keyboard came out and it was mechanical failure. my laptop was under coverage but when i gave it to them for repairs they quoted me for it. this company just wants customers money in their pocket. they dont care how you feel when they charge you hundreds of hard earned dollars. i wish this company to go bust. i will never ever buy any apple product in my life. overall i love it. first when i move the screen to put it in tablet position the hinge doesn t seem totally solid. i feel like i need to be really gentle with it but maybe that s just me. also and this maybe is another personal quirk but the keyboard sits a little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop. first off amazing laptop three years ago i had purchased this bad boy and it still runs great if i were to have any technical difficulties the local apple and contact line were able to help me asap it was quite impressive. i myself had purchased the gig drive laptop and as a dj with thousands of songs pictures and other things...and after years i have managed to fill around of my gigs. there is so much room pros amazing storage both and gig ram needed if you are as productive as i am dj photography movie making etc its quick no anti spyware needed never had a virus and i never will build solid and durable bought the year warranty and boy it was needed because of my doings cons. if you fall behind in updates your laptop will become progressively slower just update it...then its back to normal sometimes when i stared mine up it would take a few extra minutes to boot on other times it is a few seconds cannot manually take battery out unless you work for apple or have the tools overall it is a fantastic laptop. mine has been though hundreds of parties weddings quinces anything involving performances it can take it this laptop was made for art music beatmaking pictures movies graphic design. by the way it comes with apps and hardware that can already support what i had just listed. this laptop will last you a half decade if not a full decade. soon i will be hitting the year mark and i think this thing can make it another in my opinion. get this now by the way...i paid for this particular laptop roughly grand...look at the price now this is a great laptop. i bought it for college and couldn t be happier. the ssd and complement each other really well. i was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows but it is pretty awesome. if you are looking for a light durable and extremely effecient laptop buy this one they really know what they are doing. the laptop is so easy to work with. like it was designed for what people would want to the system to do very userfriendly. its simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great aside from its quality design and sexy looks. if you dont like windows i would suggest trying a mac. the investment is worth it. have bought several laptops in last several years and hands down this has been the best ever. mac user interface is just the best. also the laptop is quite no more burnt laps best screen display and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over. only thing i dislike is that everything for mac is expensive but i guess you pay for quality not impressed with macintosh products. in fact i am completely frustrated. also many software programs are not compatible with the ios platform. be sure the programs you need will work on a mac before you buy one i had heard people speak highly of the macbook pro for college students and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use. the macbook pro is useful for college students for many reasons it is the cheapest product in the line of macbook s the new operating system called snow leopard is installed and ready for use the battery life has increased from the last version from hours to hours making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger. reliability throughout the past few years i have had no problems with the macbook pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws. durability my computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it. usability the macbook pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who doesn t necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers. the processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly. the macbook pro has a significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes pros o it usually runs very smoothly but apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers. o it has an extended battery life. o it is extremely user friendly. cons o some people don t enjoy the way the processing system runs but don t have any issues with getting it to function. o others have problems with the applications depending what they need to use the device for for example engineering majors need extra applications &amp; systems to do some work but they are easily downloadable. my first laptop ever and it is a flips into a tablet mode also brilliant. so far so good. battery doesn t hold up to what it said in the description but i got it refurb d and i imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price just a guess . still getting used to typing on it my palms keep hitting the mousepad and causing the cursor to jump and moving me off of where i was typing. plenty of ports and since this is my first laptop i really don t have anything to compare it to. note no dvd drive no ethernet port screen is too small to read and almost impossible to touch with a normal adult finger. the brightest screen setting appeared dim in normal room light. keyboard is flimsy and mediocre at best. the touch pad feel is a on scale computer seemed sluggish for an intel core device. power on good luck finding it. i would run back to computer store and return this expensive toy. signed not impressed i bought this a few months ago and it s holding up fairly well. runs fast the touch screen hasn t lost any sensitivity i m overall very happy with it. this one doesn t do that. the trackpad is pretty crappy but aren t they all this is my first apple computer and i couldn t be more pleased. ios does everything its billed to do and much much more. literally every detail has been thought out and designed with the user in mind. i can t believe how much time it saves me through automatic processes. the computer of the people i love this laptop. the batter lasts as long as claimed. i get about or so hours playing the sims. i haven t really officially tested it yet but it s a long time. i hate plugging my laptop in because i don t want to leave it on too long and hurt the battery but with this laptop i rarely have to charge it. the touchscreen is responsive and even works with my crappy dollar stylus. the only problem i have is with windows i hate windows it made me sign up with microsoft and sometimes won t let me download things that are harmful to my computer but that s what anti virus software is for lol. the wifi rumor hasn t happened to me. the wifi works great. it feels very well built. the metal is very expensive feeling. the laptop is a little more than an inch thick when closed. i m a very weak girl and i could lift this laptop with one hand however i d get tired soon lol. the screen is not good for carrying around in your bare hands. i bought my first macbook exactly months ago and was really happy with my new toy but what was not my surprise when i turned it on days ago and the screen was completely black. i can hear the noise of the computer turning on and the lights also turn on but the screen in completely dead. the best computer i ve ever bought. the simple look of icons and format makes it easy to navigate through programs and download files. the only issue i had was with the harddrive. the harddrive crashed and i thought i had lost the whole computer. replacing the harddrive in this laptop is extremely easy a couple screws on the back to remove the backplate and the harddrive is pretty much plug and play. and apple was happy to install the latest osx for free you wont be disappointed with this computer it s just a matter of getting used to the touchpad commands. thankfully i have earphones and an external amplifier for audio; the onboard speakers are just terrible. but what should i expect from a unit that is this thin and this light the most disappointing purchase of my life i received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after i purchased this horrible machine. within the first few months that i bought it there was clearly a problem with the hard drive. the online customer service was awful. gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile. no one would ever answer my question as to why i couldn t get another new macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my macbook was still under warranty. as a matter of fact no matter how many times i asked that question the employees i spoke purposely ignored it. they didn t say yes and they didn t say no they just pretended that i never asked it which was incredibly frustrating. i ve been to the bar several times they have been very nice . they have now basically replaced everything inside my machine told me there was a problem with the hardware so i now have a machine. maybe i m not being reasonable but i don t feel that s the same as a new computer because i didn t pay for a refurbished computer. i still have weird freezing problems with it and it s pretty slow but it s not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in. i had delusions of grandeur regarding apple s customer and the of their etc.. etc...blah...blah... i m sure most people s macbooks work just fine but fyi if you get the factory dud you re stuck with it and no one at apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away. one os for this platform no oem os paraphernalia and automatic updates. i am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the mac well she was right whatever in the world took me so long to get a computer that just works. i m no power user but i have had no learning curve with the mac and i don t do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the os. i did buy office for the mac at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for and that was a steal in my opinion. otherwise i am happily a mac user. for a premium laptop sold in the apple macbook pro inch base model is about as basic as it gets no ssd no discrete graphics no display and no touch screen. but apple does not pretend it has any of these. what it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side apple s osx mountain lion the sleek looks apple always delivers reasonable specs good battery life nice keyboard and excellent trackpad. those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use macs. the macbook pro inch laptop is for those who want to use a mac but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution. this mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair. hard drives can be replaced ram can be added as needed and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge. this added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money detracts from the computer s value. lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a fivestar purchase but for the price this is a four star good computer. tldr version good reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive. i am really sorry i bought this machine. i was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase. this machine has made me go there times and has been nothing but a continuous problem. finally they are sending it in for a motherboard replacement. it s a lemon . so i m cooled on mac buys. they did not replace the motherboard. instead they tightened a loose wire. it also has a big new scratch on the top cover. i started it up and it still has the same problem i went in to fix. so i m going back to genius bar for visit i think it may have to be apple don t care instead of apple care. you get what you pay for right mac is complicated and frustrating at moments. i watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough. i should have known better. i hope you don t make the same mistake... when i first got the computer i noticed the tracking pad was hard to click. i took my macbook to the apple store and they had to replace the battery after month of use since it was swelling. they tried to tell me that the battery wasn t covered by the warranty and it costs about to replace. they ended up not charging me. other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long i m pretty happy with the computer. i m a designer turned frontend developer and this computer is unusable for frontend development. opening photoshop takes fooooooorrrever as do all programs that do not begin with an i . the free upgrade to mountain lion failed. it tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again. before and after i resolved that issue i saw the damn beachball all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell it s doing while i wait for it. i spend so much time waiting for it. i can t believe people like these computers. now that they are not virus free ... l i see absolutely no benefit to apple products as they are slower more expensive and do not last as long. don t waste your money. my hp seemed great at first then the problems started.....wireless adapter would just &quot;disappear&quot; and the system said it didn t have a network card. sometimes it comes back sometimes not. hp was no help. the lettering wore off the keys so you better be able to type blind. the battery lasted months then pffft.....gone. when i had a boot up issue the hp recovery didn t work. the disks i made wouldn t work.....hp support stated &quot;we re a hardware company not a software company.&quot; then there was a power cord recall....hp never notified us.....and we did register......never again. i don t have the inclination or time to devote to a companies tech support search functions or hold times.....dropped the hp and never looked back. i gave this product stars because i have been looking for a macbook pro for a long time and i found it here for a wonderful price. i have used this product for only days but i can t wait to use it more. i really like mac/apple products because of their operating system. i can tweet and use facebook from the sidebar which is really nice. i also like i have the option to push calendars photos and contacts to an ipad ipod touch or iphone if i had any of those . the only thing i have had trouble with so far is transferring music to itunes which i would have liked to do though i used itunes on a computer separate from my linux computer but i could not figure that out. i just ended up using my ipod to transfer my itunes music and i redownloaded my amazon music losing my ratings . i have not tried gaming on it but i have heard that mac/apple does not do games well. i plan on using my macbook pro for a long time. when i decided to buy my first computer i wish i had bought a mac first. if the price doesn t deter you you ll find it well worth it in terms of troublefree operation. i ve had it for more than a year and i ve found that no antivirus software is needed as long as you don t download anything without being sure that it s from a legitimate source. from time to time i get the spinning beach ball that holds up progress. i can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the show all bookmarks icon the open book icon at the upper left . once in a long while that doesn t work; in that case i turn the computer off then on again and sign in problem solved. i ll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself and just conclude by saying that i m delighted with my purchase. received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed. to go left i have to go right and vice versa and to go up i have to go down. when i attach a mouse it s fine but the touchpad is really annoying. i went through the settings and there isn t a way to fix it. it s a great laptop but right now it s annoying to use the touchpad.'"

and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby', 'the lesson learned here is it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible as fast as they can and in this day and age the customer no longer is right all the times', 'i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd

to me', 'unable to boot up this brand new laptop', 'spent hours on phone with hp technical support', 'they went through asking me open up various components taking battery out hard disk apart and after hours on phone could not fix it', 'they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site', 'i am going to go back and return at store i bought from this computer had exactly the

tried both motorola and htc plugged into the usb port', 'called tech support and got the usual acer we don t support software but for $$$ we can help you i explained there was no software involved in booting', 'no tey don t even support their own bios and it could be a problem with the bios how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity needless to say a pc that can t support a cell phone is less than useless with today s company fighting over marketshare its a shame that asus can get away with the inept staff answering thephone', 'i agree with the previous comment that asus tech support is horrible which is a con in my opinion', 'summary i ve had this laptop for months out of the blue the power adapter stops working', 'but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website frustrated i hung up and tried to call back days later to be told that it takes days for turnaround time', 'this was the day and part still had not been shipped', 'the rep did not even answer my question i had to ask him if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he didn t even try to acknowledge my question', 'i m tired of the inept service', 'if you are looking for a netbook pc do not buy from asus unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can t find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small', 'i m really frustrated by this experience', 'how does the power supply not work our apple macbook pro notebook computer notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking', 'i do everything on this computer check email facebook shop check blogs write papers listen to music and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv', 'it pretty much does everything we could ever need and looks great to boot', 'apple is always great about the aesthetics of things they always come up with good looking products', 'it didn t take me long to get switched over to the mac computer programs and navigation it s been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better', 'so if you re thinking of a laptop i would heartily recommend theapple macbook pro notebook computer notebook for all your needs it s great and we will always stick with apple computers we have been so happy with them', 'the macbook pro is portable durable and very capable', 'it has a hour battery life when you re doing web browsing and word editing making it perfect for the classroom or office and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ll have a battery life of just over hours', 'it s also very energy efficient running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a watt lightbulb', 'it s graphics aren t bad at all for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics', 'the operating system and user interface is very intuitive and the large multitouch track pad is amazing', 'however the multitouch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you re gaming ', 'still this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work', 'they also have a longer service life than other computers i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks ', 'probbly the worst decision we ever made it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were', 'i love the size of the computer since i play games on it', 'i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have', 'also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard', 'so i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer first it does not have a push button to open the lid', 'it is held in place magnetically', 'there is a little indent to help open it but good luck with that', 'once open the leading edge is razor sharp', 'this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design', 'using this machine is like a mild form of torture', 'the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare', 'i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening', 'also the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it', 'i hate to say this but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back then i would', 'it is absolutely horrible to use despite all its so called advanced features', 'i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use', 'it s a bummer and one out of five is being kind', 'my mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary', 'in due course i ll remove the hard disc from this new macbook pro and dump it where it belongs in the trash', 'but the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing', 'i like this machine because its very lightweight very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent hours of battery life is really something else i highly recommend that you buy this product', 'it crashes and when it goes flat it just dies like a pc maybe worse and i loose all my open documents i hate it it is the easiest computer i have ever used i love it i can t say enough good for it it s a mac i fine apple macboook pro notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go', 'i like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races', 'it s face and depanable', 'as a graphic arts a retired instructor i still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art  it s just a great toy to have around', 'very very slow laptop', 'tons of bloatware and junk programs', 'can t reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers', 'keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed', 'lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small', 'amazing machine', 'it is a big big but since it has a screen what would you expect it is truly a desktop replacement', 'very fast and efficient does a great job with video shot on a canon mkii', 'very happy with my toshiba laptop the touchpad is very intuitive so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again of course i also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork garageband and imovie', 'i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets and rather quickly too', 'i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows on it by using the vmware program', 'now i have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the mac i also got the added bonus of a hd monitor which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh i never have had a good result with this computer', 'i was told by many that it was a great computer but we got one of these and it worked great for one year and as soon as the warrenty was up then it got really bad', 'they told me it was my loss even though it was the computer not what i ve done', 'the hard drive crashed as well and i had to buy a new power cord', 'they told me to reprogram the computer and i didn t need to do that and i lost pictures of my oldests first years of her life', 'i don t like this company nor the toshiba brand and i ll never buy another one because i ve put more into it then it is worth', 'i would rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a toshiba that isn t good at all', 'the right speaker did not work', 'again the same problem the right speaker did not work', 'i returned the laptop for a full refund', 'the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i ve ever seen', 'sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move', 'the mouse buttons are hard to push', 'i cant believe hp put this out', 'do not buy you will be disappointed', 'i m returning mine dell is a decently made pc', 'the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side', 'with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch', 'so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop', 'i love hp it s the only computer/printer we will buy', 'this is perfect for her field', 'at first when i got this product i loved it', 'the computer itself was fast ran smoothly and had no problems', 'then within months the charger crapped out on me', 'so i called compaq and after being on the phone for hours i finally got a replacement which i shouldn t have had a problem getting since it was under warranty', 'months later the battery went', 'they gave me a hard time yet again but their was a malfunction in the battery itself it didn t die', 'then one month after the warranty expired the replacement charger went', 'i had to pay for a universal charger for this cheap laptop', 'not worth it one bit', 'the people are frustrating to work with the product itself is very cheaply made and the accessories are less than satisfactory', 'also my sister got the exact same laptop since they were so cheap and after months the screen split in half just from everyday use', 'apparently under the screen there are little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth they come loose', 'and it is impossible to get them back in', 'strengths wellshaped weaknesses a bad videocard after min the screen of the notebook switched off', 'it was still working but there was nothing on the screen', 'i was said it s videocard', 'very disappointed didn t expect to repair it at once don t buy this model', 'an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will', 'mine came at w/o a dvd burner ', 'the screen is framed by half to a fullinch margin that is obviously unnecessary reduces the screen size and increases the bulk', 'the usb ports

to switch and buy this mac', 'the benefits were immediate awesome graphics the magnetic plugin power charging power cord is great i even put it to the test by accident excellent innovation this laptop
